What is a function in Python?**\n","A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It improves modularity and reduces repetition.\n","\n","**2. How do you define a function in Python?**\n","Using the `def` keyword:\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name):\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}\"\n","```\n","\n","**3. What is the difference between a function and a method?**\n","A function is standalone, while a method is associated with an object (e.g., `list.append()` is a method).\n","\n","**4. What are positional and keyword arguments?**\n","\n","* **Positional**: Matched by order.\n","* **Keyword**: Matched by name.\n","  Example: `func(10, y=20)`\n","\n","**5. What is the default argument in a function?**\n","It assigns a default value if no value is provided by the caller:\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name=\"User\"):\n","    return f\"Hi {name}\"\n","```\n","\n","**6. What are variable-length arguments in Python?**\n","\n","* `*args`: Tuple of positional arguments\n","* `**kwargs`: Dictionary of keyword arguments\n","\n","**7. What is function return type in Python?**\n","Functions return any Python object using `return`. If omitted, `None` is returned.\n","\n","**8. What is the scope of a variable inside a function?**\n","Variables defined inside a function are **local** to that function unless declared global.\n","\n","**9. Can a function return multiple values?**\n","Yes, using tuple packing:\n","\n","```python\n","def stats(x, y):\n","    return x + y, x * y\n","```\n","\n","**10. What is recursion in Python?**\n","A function calling itself to solve subproblems. Must have a **base case** to avoid infinite loops.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **Advanced Function Concepts**\n","\n","**11. What is a higher-order function?**\n","A function that takes another function as input or returns one. Example: `map()`, `filter()`.\n","\n","**12. What is a nested function?**\n","A function defined inside another function. Used for encapsulation or closures.\n","\n","**13. What is a closure in Python?**\n","A closure remembers values from its enclosing scope even if that scope is gone.\n","\n","```python\n","def outer(x):\n","    def inner():\n","        return x\n","    return inner\n","```\n","\n","**14. What is the difference between `global` and `nonlocal`?**\n","\n","* `global`: Refers to module-level variables.\n","* `nonlocal`: Refers to variables in the nearest enclosing (non-global) function scope.\n","\n","**15. What is the use of `*args` and `**kwargs` in function definitions?**\n","They allow passing a variable number of arguments to a function, enhancing flexibility.\n","\n","**16. Can you assign a function to a variable?**\n","Yes. Functions are first-class objects in Python:\n","\n","```python\n","def add(x): return x + 1  \n","f = add  \n","f(5)  # returns 6\n","```\n","\n","**17. What is the use of `functools.partial`?**\n","It pre-fills some arguments of a function to create a new one with fewer arguments.\n","\n","**18. What is function annotation?**\n","It provides optional metadata for parameters and return types:\n","\n","```python\n","def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n","    return x + y\n","```\n","\n","**19. What is a decorator?**\n","A function that modifies another function’s behavior without changing its source:\n","\n","```python\n","@decorator\n","def func():\n","    pass\n","```\n","\n","**20. What is a callback function?**\n","A function passed as an argument to another function, executed later.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **Lambda Functions**\n","\n","**21. What is a lambda function in Python?**\n","An anonymous, inline function using the `lambda` keyword:\n","\n","```python\n","lambda x: x * 2\n","```\n","\n","**22. When should you use a lambda function?**\n","For short, throwaway functions passed to higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`.\n","\n","**23. Can lambda functions have multiple expressions?**\n","No. Lambdas are limited to a single expression (no statements, loops, etc.).\n","\n","**24. How is a lambda function different from `def`?**\n","\n","* `def`: Named, reusable, supports multiple statements.\n","* `lambda`: Anonymous, single-expression, concise.\n","\n","**25. Can lambda functions have default arguments?**\n","Yes, like regular functions:\n","\n","```python\n","lambda x, y=2: x + y\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **Map, Reduce, Filter**\n","\n","**26. What does `map()` do in Python?**\n","Applies a function to each item of an iterable:\n","\n","```python\n","map(str.upper, ['a', 'b'])  # ['A', 'B']\n","```\n","\n","**27. What does `filter()` do?**\n","Filters elements from an iterable based on a function that returns `True` or `False`.\n","\n","**28. What is `reduce()` and how is it used?**\n","From `functools`, it reduces an iterable to a single value by applying a binary function:\n","\n","```python\n","from functools import reduce\n","reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3])  # 6\n","```\n","\n","**29. What’s the difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`?**\n","\n","* `map()`: Transforms all items.\n","* `filter()`: Selects matching items.\n","* `reduce()`: Aggregates all items.\n","\n","**30. Can you chain `map`, `filter`, and `lambda` together?**\n","Yes:\n","\n","```python\n","list(map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10))))\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XKNI7uqhAVif"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"DMSSsv5-Ad12"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
