What is the difference between an instance method, class method, and static method?**\n","\n","* **Instance method**: Takes `self` as the first argument and can access instance and class data.\n","* **Class method**: Uses `@classmethod` and takes `cls` as the first argument, accessing class-level data.\n","* **Static method**: Uses `@staticmethod`, takes no special first argument, and behaves like a regular function within a class.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **12. When should you use a `@staticmethod`?**\n","\n","Use `@staticmethod` when the method doesn’t need to access instance or class data. It's purely utility logic grouped within a class context.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **13. How does `@classmethod` work, and when would you use it?**\n","\n","`@classmethod` receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument. It’s used to access or modify class state and for creating alternative constructors.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **14. What is the significance of the `self` keyword?**\n","\n","`self` refers to the current object instance. It is used to access instance variables and methods from within class methods.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **15. What happens if you omit `self` in an instance method?**\n","\n","Python will raise a `TypeError` because the method expects an object instance but receives fewer arguments than defined.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **16. How do you define and use a property in Python?**\n","\n","You can use the `@property` decorator to define a getter, and `@<property_name>.setter` to define a setter:\n","\n","```python\n","@property  \n","def age(self):  \n","    return self._age\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **17. What is the difference between a method and a function in Python?**\n","\n","A method is a function defined inside a class and takes `self` or `cls` as a parameter. A function is standalone and not bound to a class or instance.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **18. How do you use the `property()` function to create getters and setters?**\n","\n","```python\n","def get_x(self): return self._x  \n","def set_x(self, value): self._x = value  \n","x = property(get_x, set_x)\n","```\n","\n","It binds access control logic to attribute access.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **19. What are dunder (magic) methods? Name a few commonly used ones.**\n","\n","Dunder methods are special methods with double underscores, like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, `__eq__`, `__add__`. They customize object behavior in built-in operations.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **20. How can you override built-in methods like `__str__` or `__eq__`?**\n","\n","You override them by defining them in your class. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","def __str__(self):  \n","    return f\"{self.name}\"\n","```\n","\n","This controls how the object is represented as a string.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"i0p1YIVJ_AhO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"n9umgstM_DIc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
