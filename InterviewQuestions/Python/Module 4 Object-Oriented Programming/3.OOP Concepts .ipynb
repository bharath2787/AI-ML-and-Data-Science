What are the four pillars of OOP?**\n","\n","1. **Encapsulation** – Bundling data and methods.\n","2. **Abstraction** – Hiding internal details.\n","3. **Inheritance** – Reusing code via parent-child relationships.\n","4. **Polymorphism** – Using a single interface to represent different types or behaviors.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **22. What is inheritance, and how does Python implement it?**\n","\n","Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire attributes and methods from another class (parent). In Python, it’s implemented by passing the parent class in parentheses:\n","\n","```python\n","class Child(Parent):\n","    pass\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **23. How is method overriding different from method overloading?**\n","\n","* **Overriding**: Redefining a method in the subclass with the same name and signature as in the parent.\n","* **Overloading**: Not directly supported in Python. Achieved via default or variable-length arguments.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **24. What is multiple inheritance, and how is it handled in Python?**\n","\n","Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. Python resolves conflicts using **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**, typically using the C3 linearization algorithm.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **25. Explain polymorphism with a real-world Python example.**\n","\n","Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated through a common interface:\n","\n","```python\n","class Dog:\n","    def speak(self): return \"Bark\"\n","\n","class Cat:\n","    def speak(self): return \"Meow\"\n","\n","def animal_sound(animal):\n","    print(animal.speak())\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **26. What is encapsulation? How is it implemented in Python?**\n","\n","Encapsulation restricts direct access to an object’s data. In Python, it's implemented by defining attributes as protected (`_var`) or private (`__var`) and using methods or properties to access them.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **27. What is the difference between is-a and has-a relationships?**\n","\n","* **Is-a**: Inheritance (e.g., `Dog is-a Animal`)\n","* **Has-a**: Composition (e.g., `Car has-a Engine`)\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **28. What is duck typing in Python?**\n","\n","Duck typing is dynamic typing where the object's suitability is determined by presence of methods/attributes rather than the actual type. “If it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.”\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **29. Can you explain the SOLID principles?**\n","\n","* **S**: Single Responsibility\n","* **O**: Open/Closed Principle\n","* **L**: Liskov Substitution\n","* **I**: Interface Segregation\n","* **D**: Dependency Inversion\n","  These guide scalable, maintainable OOP design.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **30. How do OOP concepts help in code reuse and maintenance?**\n","\n","OOP encourages modularity, abstraction, and reusability. Inheritance promotes reuse, while encapsulation and abstraction reduce complexity, making code easier to maintain and extend.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"IdV8Q4ek_JQ4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"8H8QUulw_PFi"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
