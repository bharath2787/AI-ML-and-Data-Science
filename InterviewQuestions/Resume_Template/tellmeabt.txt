"Hi, I’m a  BTech graduate in Computer Science, and I’ve completed a 5-month Full Stack Data Science and Generative AI certification from NareshIT. It was a hands-on program with live coding sessions, weekly assignments, and regular lab work — which really helped me build a strong foundation across machine learning, deep learning, and model deployment.

As part of the course, my capstone project was an English-to-Hindi language translator. I built it completely from scratch using a Seq2Seq LSTM model in TensorFlow. I handled everything — data cleaning, tokenization, model training, and deploying the final app using Streamlit. It gave me a deep understanding of sequence models and how to take an idea from concept to a working solution.

In addition to that, I built a content-based movie recommendation system using NLP techniques, image classifiers using CNNs and transfer learning models like VGG16 and MobileNet, and a gesture-controlled virtual mouse using OpenCV and MediaPipe. These projects helped me work across different domains like NLP, computer vision, and recommender systems.

I’ve also explored Generative AI by building chatbots with DialoGPT and Flan-T5, a text summarizer with BART, and image captioning and visual question answering tools using BLIP — all with interactive interfaces using Streamlit or Gradio.


"I really enjoy building things that work in the real world. It’s exciting to take a model and turn it into something useful that people can actually try out. I’m looking forward to joining a team where I can keep learning, work on real projects, and grow as a data scientist."
