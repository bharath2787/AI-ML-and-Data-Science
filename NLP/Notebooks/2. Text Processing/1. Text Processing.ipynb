Cost is wall for me.<br> - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .<br>- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.<br>AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATE<br>i turned off the auto update at first place .<br>i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.<br>So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened .

I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .<br>As a whole i didn't recommend base models ,i felt i must have buy pro variant but for person who need ios in affordable price i recommend 13 is better than 14</span>''')"],"metadata":{"id":"S7kj37-QAdwP"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NBK3ZgwUwySt"},"source":["# Removing Special Characters"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["* The function `remove_special_characters` removes special characters from a string using regex.\n","* If `remove_digits` is `False` (default), it keeps letters, digits, and spaces, and removes other characters.\n","* If `remove_digits` is `True`, it removes digits as well, leaving only letters and spaces.
