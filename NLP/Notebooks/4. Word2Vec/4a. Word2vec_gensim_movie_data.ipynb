The murder in the alley? The bad guy with the shark mask? The Nazi Pope? The clumsy lip synching by the plastic woman in the wheel chair? The plastic woman having sex? All the above? Yes and much more.<br /><br />Lets cut to the chase: this movie is awful. The first thing is the bad script. Crappy burger chain using human remains funded by the 'Nazi Pope' with crappy F-rated detectives on their tale. And somehow related to a shark-man who wants revenge. Already makes your head hurt.<br /><br />Then you got the crappy sound editing and the lousy camera work. Could they get the mannequin to lip synch right or was that out of the budget? And what is up with the mannequin sex scene? Just plain retarded in every aspect.<br /><br />Quite frankly this is the worst movie I have never seen such bad acting in all my life. In fact, this is the worst movie I have ever seen so far in my life. The only comparable film in horrible quality is \\\\\\\"Deady Drifter\\\\\\\" - aka \\\\\\\"Out\\\\\\\" with Danny Glover. But this one, with its non-ending ending and lack of brain power prove to be the undoing before this one ever began.<br /><br />Sucks, sucks, and yes - sucks. \\\\\\\"F\\\\\\\"\\\"\",\n          \"\\\"Okay, I understand that this is a kid's movie, and that it's intended to simply be fun. However, that's no excuse for the wreck of a screenplay provided by Britt Allcroft. Some day I may be compelled out of sheer obsession to document the many problems with this movie, but the most fundamental flaw is the continued use of the \\\\\\\"Shining Time\\\\\\\" additions to the Awdry stories. Didi Conn is the only thing shining in Shining Time, created for US TV audiences to stitch together the excellent model railroad Thomas stories. The only thing is, they didn't need to be stitched together, as they stand up just fine on their own in book and video. Worse, the Shining Time portions on TV are excruciating to watch...and now the whole premise is brought to a movie.<br /><br />Now it seems there's some kind of magic railroad connecting a mythical British island railroad to Shining Time, clearly in the USA. In fact, it must be in Lancaster, PA, USA, because the Strasburg Railroad locomotive #475 makes a few appearances in the movie (in Strasburg and Harrisburg, PA) and I doubt it's ever been across the Atlantic.<br /><br />Anyway, to make a long and painful story short, there's almost no motivation for any of the characters in this story to do anything at all. Somehow Mr. Conductor (not an Awdry creation) is running out of gold dust, which will somehow make his \\\\\\\"universe\\\\\\\" fall apart. There's no mention as to why supplies would dwindle to nothing when it's the only thing holding Sodor together - Mr. Conductor is pretty irresponsible if you ask me. He summons his idiot brother who is no help at all, and together they and the rest of the characters stumble on the answer and save the day in a completely underwhelming conclusion.<br /><br />The gold dust emergency happens to coincide with the apparent return of a diesel engine intent on destroying steam engines. The whole evil-diesel and his predictable sidekick-duo are completely unnecessary and just scare the little kids (like my two-year-old). I assume that the marketing folks needed a few more new characters to work into the merchandising mix because there's no excuse for the plot damage caused by the diesel.<br /><br />Your kids may enjoy the railroad scenes, but don't watch this movie unless you want your brains to leak out of your head and turn to mush. The models are great, but the acting and writing are ridiculous. Avoid at all costs!!!\\\"\",\n          \"\\\"The Fans of \\\\\\\"Star Wars - Clone Wars\\\\\\\" may tar and feather me for my opinion, but after seeing this on TV a few months ago (aired directly after the original \\\\\\\"Star Wars - Attack of the Clones\\\\\\\"-Picture) i was extremely disappointed. As a \\\\\\\"Star Wars\\\\\\\"-Fan since 1977 i expected something, that surely will not par up to George Lucas original movies, but a least pay homage to the original movies, but after 15 Minutes i turned the TV off. The cheap animation (boldly called in another comment \\\\\\\"state-of-the-art\\\\\\\"...) was on the roughest level, The movings, explosions and laser-shots was always the same animation-cels reused and reused, the depicting of the actors in his animated forms was ridiculous, the dialogue was extremely stupid... i can't help, i simply did not like this film! It was an insult to George Lucas original movies for me! The next shock for me was to search here on the IMDb for it... Rating 8.1!! Come on: Ed Wood (in drunken condition) would it done better!

The murder in the alley? The bad guy with the shark mask? The Nazi Pope? The clumsy lip synching by the plastic woman in the wheel chair? The plastic woman having sex? All the above? Yes and much more.<br /><br />Lets cut to the chase: this movie is awful. The first thing is the bad script. Crappy burger chain using human remains funded by the 'Nazi Pope' with crappy F-rated detectives on their tale. And somehow related to a shark-man who wants revenge. Already makes your head hurt.<br /><br />Then you got the crappy sound editing and the lousy camera work. Could they get the mannequin to lip synch right or was that out of the budget? And what is up with the mannequin sex scene? Just plain retarded in every aspect.<br /><br />Quite frankly this is the worst movie I have never seen such bad acting in all my life. In fact, this is the worst movie I have ever seen so far in my life. The only comparable film in horrible quality is \\\\\\\"Deady Drifter\\\\\\\" - aka \\\\\\\"Out\\\\\\\" with Danny Glover. But this one, with its non-ending ending and lack of brain power prove to be the undoing before this one ever began.<br /><br />Sucks, sucks, and yes - sucks. \\\\\\\"F\\\\\\\"\\\"\",\n          \"\\\"Okay, I understand that this is a kid's movie, and that it's intended to simply be fun. However, that's no excuse for the wreck of a screenplay provided by Britt Allcroft. Some day I may be compelled out of sheer obsession to document the many problems with this movie, but the most fundamental flaw is the continued use of the \\\\\\\"Shining Time\\\\\\\" additions to the Awdry stories. Didi Conn is the only thing shining in Shining Time, created for US TV audiences to stitch together the excellent model railroad Thomas stories. The only thing is, they didn't need to be stitched together, as they stand up just fine on their own in book and video. Worse, the Shining Time portions on TV are excruciating to watch...and now the whole premise is brought to a movie.<br /><br />Now it seems there's some kind of magic railroad connecting a mythical British island railroad to Shining Time, clearly in the USA. In fact, it must be in Lancaster, PA, USA, because the Strasburg Railroad locomotive #475 makes a few appearances in the movie (in Strasburg and Harrisburg, PA) and I doubt it's ever been across the Atlantic.<br /><br />Anyway, to make a long and painful story short, there's almost no motivation for any of the characters in this story to do anything at all. Somehow Mr. Conductor (not an Awdry creation) is running out of gold dust, which will somehow make his \\\\\\\"universe\\\\\\\" fall apart. There's no mention as to why supplies would dwindle to nothing when it's the only thing holding Sodor together - Mr. Conductor is pretty irresponsible if you ask me. He summons his idiot brother who is no help at all, and together they and the rest of the characters stumble on the answer and save the day in a completely underwhelming conclusion.<br /><br />The gold dust emergency happens to coincide with the apparent return of a diesel engine intent on destroying steam engines. The whole evil-diesel and his predictable sidekick-duo are completely unnecessary and just scare the little kids (like my two-year-old). I assume that the marketing folks needed a few more new characters to work into the merchandising mix because there's no excuse for the plot damage caused by the diesel.<br /><br />Your kids may enjoy the railroad scenes, but don't watch this movie unless you want your brains to leak out of your head and turn to mush. The models are great, but the acting and writing are ridiculous. Avoid at all costs!!!\\\"\",\n          \"\\\"The Fans of \\\\\\\"Star Wars - Clone Wars\\\\\\\" may tar and feather me for my opinion, but after seeing this on TV a few months ago (aired directly after the original \\\\\\\"Star Wars - Attack of the Clones\\\\\\\"-Picture) i was extremely disappointed. As a \\\\\\\"Star Wars\\\\\\\"-Fan since 1977 i expected something, that surely will not par up to George Lucas original movies, but a least pay homage to the original movies, but after 15 Minutes i turned the TV off. The cheap animation (boldly called in another comment \\\\\\\"state-of-the-art\\\\\\\"...) was on the roughest level, The movings, explosions and laser-shots was always the same animation-cels reused and reused, the depicting of the actors in his animated forms was ridiculous, the dialogue was extremely stupid... i can't help, i simply did not like this film! It was an insult to George Lucas original movies for me! The next shock for me was to search here on the IMDb for it... Rating 8.1!! Come on: Ed Wood (in drunken condition) would it done better!

Here's how it works in simple terms:\n","\n","### 1. **Word Embeddings in Word2Vec**\n","Word2Vec represents each word in the vocabulary as a high-dimensional vector (embedding). These vectors capture semantic meanings and relationships between words. For example, similar words like \"king\" and \"queen\" will have vector representations that are close to each other in the vector space.\n","\n","### 2. **Vector Arithmetic (Word Analogies)**\n","Once words are represented as vectors, you can perform arithmetic operations on these vectors, like addition and subtraction. This can reveal relationships between words.\n","\n","Let’s break down how `most_similar(positive=['king', 'man'], negative=['queen'])` works:\n","\n","### 3. **What Happens Internally?**\n","\n","- **`positive=['king', 'man']`**: The vectors for \"king\" and \"man\" are added together. This operation roughly means \"combine the semantic concepts of 'king' and 'man'.\"\n","  \n","- **`negative=['queen']`**: The vector for \"queen\" is subtracted. This operation essentially means \"remove the semantic meaning of 'queen' from the combination.\"\n","\n","The final equation is:\n","\n","$[\n","\\text{Resulting Vector} = \\text{Vec('king')} + \\text{Vec('man')} - \\text{Vec('queen')}\n","]$\n","\n","### 4. **Finding the Nearest Vector (Answer)**\n","Word2Vec then looks for the word whose vector is closest (in terms of cosine similarity) to the resulting vector from the above arithmetic. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors: the smaller the angle, the more similar the vectors.\n","\n","In this case, **Vec('king') - Vec('queen') + Vec('man')** results in a vector that is closest to **Vec('woman')**. Therefore, the model will return \"woman\" as the most similar word to this combination.\n","\n","### 5. **Analogy Example:**\n","Let’s break down a famous analogy:\n","```python\n","model.wv.most_similar(positive=['king', 'woman'], negative=['man'])\n","```\n","Here’s the intuition:\n","- **`Vec('king') - Vec('man') + Vec('woman')`**: This equation takes the vector for \"king,\" subtracts the \"man\" aspect, and adds \"woman.\"\n","- What remains is a concept similar to \"queen\" (the female counterpart of \"king\"), so the model returns \"queen.\"\n","\n","### 6. **How the Model Learns These Relationships**\n","Word2Vec learns word embeddings by training on large corpora of text, where it tries to predict words based on their context (Skip-Gram) or predict context words from a target word (CBOW). Through this process, the model captures semantic and syntactic relationships between words.\n","\n","For example:\n","- **Syntactic Relationships:** _\"walking\"_ is related to _\"walk\"_ as _\"swimming\"_ is related to _\"swim\"_.\n","- **Semantic Relationships:** _\"Paris\"_ is related to _\"France\"_ as _\"Berlin\"_ is related to _\"Germany\"_.\n","\n","### Why This Works:\n","- Words with similar meanings or grammatical roles (like \"queen\" and \"king\") are often used in similar contexts, leading to similar vector representations.\n","- Arithmetic operations on vectors, like addition and subtraction, approximate the difference between these semantic concepts.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"F15SLIgve6pn"}}]}
