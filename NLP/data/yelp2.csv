1.5,1,"it is todays experience that got HCC (Hobo Camper Country) this review.
I needed a side vent cover for a tent trailer.  They did not have it in stock, and would need to order it, so in good faith I pre-paid for the order on my Mastercard.  
On my way to the doctor I stopped in at ArrKann RV who had the same part for 50% less.  
I called HCC to inform them and cancel the order since they have to place it with their supplier anyways. (sale transaction @9:59am, called @11:00am, refund transaction@11:31am)
For my courtesy that they didn't have excess stock on hand they charged me 10% restocking fee (very generous of them since it's 20%).  the explanation was MasterCard charges them for the sale and refund.  Any competent retailer knows a credit card sale isn't final until the terminal is closed out at the end of the day, and the transaction could have been easily voided with no fees involved.

I'm sure HCC may have provided good sales and service to someone (not me).
It would be nice if owners/operators knew their own sales systems instead of blaming Mastercard to scam a few dollars."
1.5,2,"Meh, needed parts got attitude.  went somewhere else got looked after."
1.5,1,"My father took his motorhome in to get the Antenna and Brake Controller  repaired. He was told it would be about $350.00. When the motorhome was picked up 2 weeks later he was given a bill for over $900.00. They didn't contact him to let him know what they were going to charge him before the work. I have had to fix the connection on the back bumper as they didn't even have it sealed, the wires would have been exposed to the weather. This is incredibly poor workmanship. With this business it is defiantly BUYER BEWARE."
5,5,"Eric was great! He diagnosed my LQ horse trailer problem over the phone, had the correct parts in hand when he arrived and went through the other appliances too. Fair prices, took the time to explain, responded great to texts and was even early for the appointment. We will for sure use him again. Thanks Eric!"
5,5,"Always ready to help us whenever we are in town. Knowledgeable, honest and shows up when he says. Eric is the man to call. 
James & Carrie Cameron"
5,5,"We have had several RV guys work on our trailer over the years, none compare to Eric. I've been in heavy highway construction for 45 years I know a real mechanic when I see one. This guy knows what he doing and gos the extra mile to take care of his clients. 
We were driving thru AZ on a 2 month trip across the country and made a stop at family's. The heat was bad and we only had one air conditioner and it was time to install a second one. I looked here on Yelp for a RV store. When I came across E's RV repair I saw all the great reviews and knew he was the guy. 
He went out of his way to get us pricing quickly and came that day to install it. 
We can't say how much we appreciate his hard work and great price to add our second AC unit. 
Don't hesitate to use Eric for any RV repairs, trust us you won't be sorry. 
Thanks again Eric. 
Joe & Maggie"
5,5,"Honest, experienced, competent, trained mobile RV repair service. Eric is one of a very small handful of RV techs in the greater Phoenix metro area that knows what he's doing, does it right the first time, and stands behind his work, period. He diagnosed our Norcold refrigerator problem, removed the non-functioning cooling unit, connected us with an expert repair service in Tucson, and reinstalled the repaired unit in our refrigerator. I woul not hesitate to call him again or to recommend him to others. Call him, you'll be glad you did !"
5,5,"Agree with the prior reviewers - Eric is top notch in knowledge and service!  Had to remove the kitchen island in our fifth wheel, just to get the frig out for repair.  Tight timeframe, and required two appoints - for the removal, and then 2 days later the replacement.  Still he fit us in despite a very busy schedule -- and was educating me with how-to tips the entire time he was here.  His local network is vast too.  Awesome guy to work with, and competitive fees!"
5,5,"I have had Eric work on my living quarters horse trailer and a used pop-up camper that I just bought. Eric is super responsive, called me back with some ""things to try"" before he came over and had parts in hand when he showed up exactly when he said he would. I would give Eric 6 stars if that was an option. I would recommend him to any and all for any trailer repairs or maintenance. His prices were very fair and reasonable. Such a relief to find such a nice, reliable, knowledgeable, fair technician. You are one-in-a-million these days Eric! Thank you for your fantastic service!"
5,5,"Eric is AWESOME!  He diagnosed problems in my Class A Holiday Rambler Endeavor in Florence AZ.  He called the warranty company for coverage.  He drove out to Palm Springs CALIF to repair the coach!!!  He completed the repairs quickly! (Because he knows what he's doing!). If we ever need anything this is the ""Go to guy"" no matter what state your in in!!!  Can you believe this guy!  The local RV repair place won't even fix the failure of the repairs they do and charge way too much!  I'll take it to AZ for Eric!!!  E's is number ONE!!!"
5,5,"We're here from out of town for our first Grandchild's birth. We brought our used but new to us 40 ft toy hauler. We had a small issue with the fridge at home but it worked ok. Well by the time we got to Tempe, AZ the fridge quit working completely. We called camping world and they couldn't get us in for a couple weeks.  So my husband started looking up RV repair and he came across Eric from a mobile RV repair. He came out to our trailer 3 different times to fix the issue, and in the end we ended up having to replace the fridge, but not from lack of Eric trying everything he could think of or test. It would work for a while and then quit again. Anyway we couldn't be more happy with Eric's service and friendliness andddd after all that work trying to fix it, he only charged us for the first service call. WOW!!! If you live in the Phoenix or Tempe or the surrounding area and need RV service, give him a call.  480-207-8999"
5,5,"Eric came recommended to us by another RV owner. She said he was the best. She's right. He is knowledgeable and honest, and we wouldn't dream of calling anyone else for RV repairs or questions. Highly recommended."
5,5,"Eric is one of the best. He knows the business of RV repair.  And if he don't, he will direct you to one that does.  He is very experienced in RV repair. I would highly recommend E's RV for anything you need repaired on your RV.  My first call to him sold me.  I could tell he knew his business.  When I need a repair, he is the one I will call."
3.5,5,"Very clean and well-maintained KOA. Pool is pretty and weather was perfect for swimming. The mini-gold was extra at 2$ a person and 5$ charge if you lose the ball. The playground is super nice and the kids give it two thumbs up. The grounds are perfect for riding bikes and scooters to burn off that last little bit of super kid energy before bed. The showers are extremely clean as well as the bathrooms. The laundry room has lots of washers, dryers, and even laundry tub with folding table. The staff is very friendly bilingual. This is a great location near the city but able to have a relaxing wind down evening. Would recommend this location for families and anyone need to relax."
3.5,4,"We are on an adventure of the year. After a nice nite in Montreal and not wanting to fork over the $300 for a motel room we opted for the good old KOA. Being that we are from Billings Montana where KOA originated, thought it would be a great place to lay out heads. The price for a tent spot was as expected the going rate, $40. ( same as a provincial park.) 
We arrived late and were unable to take it in until the next morning. Just like home! Kinda nice to be 3k miles from home and feel like your only 10 miles away. A little comfort a long ways away. The park is very well kept with a nice play ground for the kids, a nice size pool and a wading pool as well. The showers were clean and the staff friendly. Also for the adventures people there is also a put put golf course. All in all a very nice experience. 
The only ""gripe"" if you will was the location of our site was rather close to the main road. There was a bit of traffic in the early AM. Definitely a nice park, just ask to stay away from the road."
3.5,4,Stayed For 4 days and 3 nights in July 2016.  Well maintained and great great restrooms and showers. Nice pool and playground area if you bring kids. Also very easy access to Montreal. Only reason a 4 and not 5 was the very weak Wifi.
3.5,4,"We were only there for one night... So really can't judge it. From what we saw it was clean and the staff were pleasant... Just not one we'll be coming back too.... Not one of our favorites that we visited ""passing thru""."
3.5,5,"We were extremely pleased with our stay at this KOA.  The staff was bilingual, friendly, and helpful with references to tourist attractions and restaurants.  The park is conveniently located close to Montreal sites, yet still maintains a camping feel.  The park was clean, quiet, and well maintained.  Highly recommend."
3.5,4,"This is a classic KOA campground. If you've stayed at KOAs before then you know what I mean... they're fairly predictable, and this one is quite typical. We stayed on a weekend for easy day trips to Montreal and it worked great for that. Not even half full on an August weekend, it was a nice surprise to have plenty of space to ourselves. The pool is decent, the campsites are lined up rather tightly packed like most KOAs, but it's quiet and comfortable. Bathrooms and showers were pretty clean and it was a good experience overall."
3.5,1,"KOA is in the business of serving travellers.  Well, when the hours of Montreal construction that I ran into a few weeks ago while driving OVER 12 HOURS from Halifax delayed me to after 9 pm, I did not think anything of rolling up to the KOA, I've done it before all over North America.   It was dark and locked up, but when I went to find a tent site it seemed to be a muddy, mosquito infested swamp.  Back to the front I called the number.  You know darn well they live above the office, but they would not open up and rent me a cabin.

I had to drive another hour to find a decent hotel.

KOA is a giant money grab, and this just proves it.  They obviously do not need to bend over back anywhere for their customers.  This particular one was just the same almost 25 years ago when we stayed there - nothing's changed.  Give it a pass.

In fact, give camping in Quebec as pass entirely.  Do not, ever, leave the highway following a 'Camping' sign because you will find they are all permanent resident parks - the signs should not be put there for tourists, very misleading."
3.5,4,"It's a nice stop.  The sites are close together but the amenities (bathrooms, laundry, playground, etc) are top notch. It's close to mass transit or a 40 minute drive into Montreal.  I'd come again."
3.5,3,"Hesitant to stay in an expensive hotel room in downtown Montreal and desirous of the possibility to escape from the city noise at the end of the day, my friend and I decided to spend three nights in a Kabin at this campground. I would recommend ensuring the weather will be warm before booking a cabin as when we arrived in early October it was in the forties and a bit chilly to be sleeping in such a space, though the space heater helped. It was otherwise everything I expected it to be: nice and quiet in early fall (though it is probably more crowded in summer) with clean amenities and easy access to the city: only a half hour drive. The Longueuil Metro station is a 15-20 minute drive away, and I'd recommend parking your car there and going into Montreal that way, as city driving was pretty stressful.

I only wish the showers were warmer and the wifi faster. It was hard to connect to the network in the cabin and I dreaded the chilly temp in the shower each morning! Overall, though, a pleasant stay."
3.5,4,Nice campground with plenty of spaces. Big rig friendly. Lots of activities. Downside is very weak WiFi and can get dusty from the roads. Nice folks and not too far from town.
3.5,3,"Being a tent camper at a KOA can be an interesting experience, but these folks do it right - the tents sites are located downslope and away from the motorhomes, and alongside the creek.

As with most KOA's, the restrooms and showers were clean and well lit, and the hot water was plentiful.  The laundry was also clean and open 24 hours.

This campground is about 5 minutes away (by car) from restaurants, gasoline (or should I say 'essence?'), and a few stores; it is about a 15 minute drive from the Longueuil metro station, from which you can access the entire city when you change trains at the Berri-UQAM station.

The only negatives I found at this campsite were plentiful mosquitoes, but also a number of tent campers had a very loud party well into the night (after 1 am) with no intervention by the staff to maintain quiet, although they had a sign that said quiet after 10 pm.

All in all, I would choose this campground again the next time I am in the area."
3.5,2,"I stayed in cabin #1. You might want to avoid that one. I plugged the coffee maker into the wall socket and shorted out the whole building. Had to get the owners over there to turn the lights back on. Later I tried to plug the I pod into the same outlet and again the lights went out. I ended up making coffee outside the next morning from a different outlet. The building looked like the wire had just been redone. there was a short in the wall socket.

We also had a wasp problem, couldn't sit on the porch due to constant buzzing around our head.

On a happier note, it was a nice campground, The toilets and showers were close. the pool was nice too. Staff was friendly"
4,5,Climate controlled!! Excellent customer service! Check out the rest then store at the best. We looked at multiple storage facilities in the area and not one was as clean or reasonably priced as Stephanie Storage. The folks in the office were very helpful and even threw in a free padlock for our 10x10 unit. We love great customer service :-)
4,5,"Great place for my stuff. Emma and Joe really know what's going on there. 
Joe does a great job at keeping the property clean and nice looking and Emma really knows how to handle the most difficult customers in a professional manner.
I feel comfortable leaving my belongings there and understand that it is MY responsibility to make sure my unit is locked up and secure before I leave. 
All in all, I can't complain. Thanks for a comfortable, honest and professional place to store my extra stuff."
4,1,"DO NOT STORE YOUR BELONGINGS HERE! 

These people are crooks! The storage facility has ALWAYS been dirty, those photos are kind. It is normally WAY WORSE. There is not security on the actual units, just the gate coming in an out. They have a habit of cutting off your locks and stealing your things out of your unit and then putting a lock of their own on the unit which they charge you to take off. 

The staff are very rude and they don't care about you. They just want your money so they can go through your stuff. 

DO NOT STORE YOUR STUFF HERE! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! RUN!!!"
4,4,This place is a really good deal for where it's at! I would store my stuff here again.
4,5,Emma and the staff are super nice.. this is a better place since Dave left..Keep up the good job
2.5,1,"I was going to rent a trailer from this company until I realized that the advertised weekend rental didn't include $49.00 prep fees and then a ton of additional fees like generators, propane, etc. All these add on fees are ridiculous. Advertise the actual fees instead of hiding them in contracts. Dishonest if you ask me."
2.5,1,"RENTER BEWARE. This place is SHADY. They never gave us a copy of the signed paper work, there was no one there when we dropped the trailer off, and therefore no one to go over an inspection with, ironically hours after dropping the trailer off at the STORAGE unit, they found a scratch, they just charged us an additional $200 to the already $200 deposit, WITHOUT even sending us an email breaking down the charges, $400 in total. I've never seen a business do such a shady thing. They don't pre fill the trailers with water, and everything you need to actually run the trailer is an up charge. Our trailer in particular started leaking water in the bathroom during our trip, and the mattresses are literally straight spring mattresses from the 80's. Save your money & find a more reputable business."
2.5,1,"hmmm ..we made a reservation over a month in advance with carson at RVPHX . put  up the deposit via amex for the G1 toyhauler that sleeps 8 for this laborday 4 day holiday weekend. 8-28-14 thru 9-1-14.
 On monday on 8-25-14 i received a phone msg from carson at rvphx stating that  someone damaged the axel on the toyhauler we had reserved and that he had to cancel our reservation for this weekend.
 Bummer right..
i called him back . went to voice mail. he texted back he was in a meeting.
 all communication after this call was via text only
HE NEVER APOLOGIZED or  ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

immediately monday i started looking for a toy hauler via craigslist and rv rental places to get a reservation for this weekend . None are available anywhere.
 thanks for nothing rvphx.

2.5,1,"**** WARNING - MUST READ BEFORE RENTING ****

I rented from they guys for Memorial day 2014, first of all they take CASH ONLY (which should be a sign). I showed up and get the trailer with my cash, backed up to the trailer, got it all loaded on then he asked me if I wanted Propane (which is REQUIRED to run the heater and fridge), and of course I said yes, so right away I was hit for another $60 or so.. one would think THIS would come with the trailer right.. along with a good battery, which I will get to in a minute.  

So I paid the monies and headed down the road. I get home and smells like Propane in the trailer really bad, I call them back the VERY next day and he said roll the windows down to air it out... I said ""OK"" (not knowing how THIS is helping the obvious gas leak ).  So after a while it doesn't smell as bad (of course 'cause windows were open).  There was nothing he was going to do, so I just headed up camping after charging the battery for about 3 hours since it was dead. (when picking up ther trailer he said the batter would require charging 30 min in morning and 30 min in afternoon while up camping).. Try 7 hours and it still WOULD NOT hold a charge.. Great times.

So I get up to Big Lake and it is rather cold (29 degrees at night) and the gas smell was soo bad, my kids could NOT sleep in the trailer and the fridge went out so ALL of our food went bad.

So I get back to explain the situation to Carson and he said 1st of all I should have SHUT OFF the Propane so it didn't smell in the trailer .. did I mention it was 29 degrees and with no Propane equals.... yep thats right NO HEAT.. I ask what he would do and he said they don't do ""refunds"".. so spent over $600 for a trailer that my family COULD NOT sleep in.. ALL my food went bad AND the battery was dead.

and get this.. he DID CONFIRM there was a gas leak in a fitting inside the trailer and STILL WOULDN'T refund a DIME, but he did want to give me a ""discount"" on my next rental... I OBVIOUSLY told him that $200 of my next rental was NOT WORTH my family Freezing due to his  faulty equipment!!

RENTERS BE-WARE ! ! !"
2.5,5,"We have had two good experiences renting.  We have rented a travel trailer and an RV.  Everything worked great, no problems whatsoever.  I will be honest, the cash only was a little nerve racking at first, but their honesty is very appeciated.

The second time renting we left a very expensive camera and camcorder in the RV.  We didn't even realize what we had done until 2 months later!  They still had everything.  They were just waiting for the owners to contact them.  They didn't know who had left it behind or how long it had been there.  We were so grateful for their honesty.  We would definitely rent again."
2.5,5,"We have rented trailers from Carson at RVPHX for a couple years now.  Every trailer has been clean and well maintained.  We always pay a little extra for the drop and go service, which allows us to drop off the trailer on our way back home, and not have to clean it ourselves. This has made renting a trailer more enjoyable and less time consuming for us.  There website is so easy to find a trailer.  I love all the pictures and details provided.  I have referred RVPHX to several people and still highly recommend them.  For the 2-4 times we camp per year, this is well worth not having a trailer payment, the maintenance and the storage fees!!"
2.5,4,Rvphx was a great experience. I rented a toy hauler that was cleaned inside and out the pick up service was quick and thorough as well as the drop off I would definitely rent again.
2.5,1,"Buyer beware! Shady business. Keep looking for someone else. Dishonest & unprofessional! Will take your money & overcharge your cc without any invoice or conversation, pretty sure that it's illegal & we will report to Better business bureau. RENT FROM SOMEONE ELSE!"
2.5,1,"DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!!! Rented two units for NASCAR weekend. One of the units was operational but filthy with tank sensors that didn't work. The other one was a complete nightmare from the get go. Water tank wouldn't hold water. They ""fixed"" it by bringing out a sealant that we were expected to apply, still didn't hold water. Their compensation was to replace that unit with a ""deluxe"" Class 3 motor home. Needless to say not deluxe given that the generator was completely shot - as in no running AC in 100 degree weather when 4 small kids were with us, a fact they knew in addition to it being filthy as well. 

Their solution, after we had to scream at them on the phone, they'll give us an external generator at no charge. Granted they did send it out Saturday evening, but they told us the guy who was dropping it off was their mechanic, Jeff, who was nice enough and said he wasn't high enough up in the business to make it right or offer any discount because of all of our troubles but come to find out his name isn't Jeff, he shares the same last name with the owner....

However, the external generator was still not a fix and the explanation was that we were taxing the system and using it beyond it's capabilities, um no, we were simply trying to run AC, that's it. My son-in-law is a certified Ford mechanic, it was obvious that the issues with what they rented us were many and severe. 

Returned both units yesterday, was anyone there to check in with, nope. Has anyone contacted us since to make it right, nope. This isn't how people who rent from you in good faith should be treated, it's not how ethical businesses are run, fake names, really?

Do yourself a favor and rent from someone else..."
2.5,5,I have used rv phx multiple times. Great variety of trailers to choose from. Easy and convenient pick up and drop off. I will continue to use them every time I rent a trailer!
2.5,1,"wATCH OUT!!!
If you want safety, this is not the place to rent. I received a trailer with 3 broken/bent stabilizers.  When I pointed this out upon return, I was told that stabilizers were optional on trailers & I didn't really need them anyway. 
When I picked up the trailer, Carson told me that the brake controller on my vehicle wasn't properly connected. He told me to drive it from Phoenix. To Payson anyway, just make sure to allow for room to stop when coming down the hills!!!!!  Really?  I went to the place that had installed the brake controller & had it fixed before my trip. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE!"
2.5,4,"Everything went as it should have. RV was a lot smaller than we thought it would be. Wish we could have seen it prior to renting, but that's just a risk you take I suppose!"
2.5,1,"We had a horrible experience. He collected over 2,000 without one receipt. Careful on their credit card charges, they feel they have the right to arbitrarily charge you what they feel is right, and tell you about it after the fact. They also sell you insurance without proof of coverage and as I understand it, you have to be licensed to sell this type of coverage. We bought the full coverage but when damage was identified and we tried to use the insurance, no records were presented and they claim it was not for that. Again, no documentation. This is a hole in the wall operation. Approach at risk, not worth the dollars in savings. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
2.5,1,If I could I would give this business negative stars. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! They do not clean or maintain there rv's/trailers! If you have an issue & contact this business they will be argumentative & come up with excuses to not fix the issue! You have to fill your own water & get your own propane. You pay in full before renting so if you have a negative experience you will not be refunded or compensated.
2.5,1,"I decided to go on a little camping expedition so I looked online (Craigslist) and found RVPHX.com. I think I bothered the guy four times with questions before I actually made it home to look at their website on the main computer. It was very prompt about answering his phone each time I called. So when I got home, I looked online at the two campers he had left and picked the one I liked and made a reservation with deposit. I was supposed to get a call on Saturday to tell me everything was good at another call on Sunday to advise me where to pick the camper up from. I didn't hear from him all weekend. I made two calls on Saturday and three calls on Sunday and left voice messages. On Monday-same, no response from my phone calls, messages or email. Finally on Tuesday I got an email from him letting me know that he messed up and the camper wasn't available. Gave me a song and dance about how he tried to go get a new one but it fell through. He couldn't find it in him to let me know Saturday he was having issues so that I could at least try to find alternative means considering the camping weekend was vastly approaching. So 3 days before I was supposed to be camping, I found myself in a frantic panic searching for a last minute camper without getting raped in pricing. As an avid Yelp user, I didn't think to look at their reviews like I should have. I would've noticed the poor rating and I would've went elsewhere reducing my stress significantly."
2.5,4,"After reserving one of the trailers and THEN reading the reviews we were worried.  HOWEVER, we didnt have any trouble at all.  The only reason we didn't give 5 stars is that the black tank was not empty when we picked it up and we didn't find out until we got to our destination.  Other than that, the guy (I'm not sure what his name was) was understanding on our complaint on that issue.  We have future reservations and we hope they go as well (or better with an empty black tank) as our previous rental."
2.5,5,I have used rv phx multiple times. Great variety of trailers to choose from. Easy and convenient pick up and drop off. I will continue to use them every time I rent a trailer!
2.5,5,"Great service, communication, and RV. Short drive from Sky Harbor airport so we got there and on the road quickly."
3,4,"Overall, our experience at Blue Dog had some issues, but resulted in a happy ending. Truly, 99% of what I considered poor service surrounded our original salesman; he was out of the office for multiple unexpected reasons (food poisoning, sick kid, busy, etc) for the six days following our original meeting (we never did see him again, even at the close of the sale or when we picked up our camper), and was not present or responsive throughout the buying process. However, I don't want one bad apple to spoil the bunch. I was extremely pleased with his back up salesman, James Flodin, who was attentive, fun and efficient, and even more impressed with the Sales Manager, Tom Hanan, who not only completed small but important tasks in his salesman's absence, but also went above and beyond to make a negative situation at closing time a positive. Despite my in-your-face, abrasive complaint in his office, he remained cool, calm and collected, and more importantly, did the right thing to fix it. Tom scored big points in my book, and truly saved a customer with Blue Dog. The Service Department was also helpful and efficient, and even patient with my being upset about something that was out of their control. Lastly, another bonus (and the big picture) was we received an awesome brand new camper at a killer, rock-bottom price, and we can't wait to hit the open road with it. Their prices beat the competition in this area hands down, and we feel we purchased an awesome camper in our budget."
3,2,"While I see, appreciate, and respect the positive reviews here, I will say that my first (and probably last) experience with BDRV was negative. I also was greeted by the very friendly woman there at the desk as you enter. She got some basic information and I shared some of the basics (and a specific travel trailer by name and general specs) on that for which I was looking.  

She called for Nelson to come over and I was greeted by him. She had said that he would be driving me around by cart to view RV's, etc.  I went the direction he went inside the showroom and we stopped at a Winnebago unit. I gave specifics on timeline for purchase, some basics on size (interior and exterior), approximate gross weight desired, year and I also gave him--by  name--a specific EVO model for idea and reference. I gave him the pre-tax, title, and license price point. At this point, it should be clear that while I had not been enrolled in a course on the intricate details of RV'ing, I had done some looking. I also shared with him, by name, a competitor where I had been looking. 

He responded that he didn't have anything like that on the lot at that time and that essentially they had not yet received such units. Seeking to clarify what he was saying, I essentially asked if what he was saying was that he had nothing that met the price point I gave. He focused on the Winnebago unit in front of us and said that that was what he had and (he noted a general ballpark of at least $2000+ over what I had outlined. He wanted me to have his card so that we could continue to connect. He said that there would be no way of really knowing what a final price would be until he sat down and discussed figures, etc. 

I had confirmed, ""So what you are saying, then, is that you don't even carry anything that comes in at the price point I gave you?"" (His response previously was that really nothing they carried would even start at that price point before tax, title, license). My price point I gave him was around $17,000 as I had done research on several units (to include the EVO 195 series) that are in that neighborhood). 

All I got as I was heading toward the counter where the first woman was (I had left my soda on the counter) was his line about there *were* others....but ""Winnebago has........."" Apparently the woman at the counter must have been following the conversation because when I got there she immediately asked if she could get me another sales associate. I tossed his card on the counter and told her no. If this business doesn't carry what apparently he must have considered ""less than"" or ""lower end"" products (e.g. he was only willing to discuss the Winnebago) then perhaps EVO/Forest River and others who are putting units on the lot should consider if they are being best served in doing so. 

I understand the nature of competition and if this business only deals in certain types of RV's or certain price-points of RV's, that is the nature of any business. However, please don't waste my time......when I have chosen to come to your specific dealership....thinking you have something you can get me to consider. Just tell me that you do not have anything on the lot and you won't have anything on the lot that will be below that $19,000+ line in the sand. I can respect that. What happened today....not only do I not respect it.....I put my hand to the keyboard and I Yelp about it.

3,5,"After a couple hiccups, we finally brought home our first Travel Trailer. We settled on the ""Imagine"" from Grand Design (thanks to my wife's great taste). 
Blue Dog RV went ABOVE & BEYOND  to make sure we were satisfied. 
A huge thanks to Derek Yamamoto in Sales. Responsive, attentive, professional, these are just a few descriptors of his character.  Derek went the extra mile!
To Brian & his team in Service & PDI. His team NEVER gave up despite several challenges with our unique tow vehicle. Shout out to George for our walk through also. 
GREAT TEAM @ Blue Dog Las Vegas. 
THANKS from our family to YOURS!!"
3,1,Our experience has been a nightmare!  I would give less stars if i could!  Our unit is less than one year old and has spent most of the months we've owned it in the service department.  It is of course broken again and they can't even get the unit in to look at it for two months!  The unit we purchased (Grand Design Momentum) is garbage and the service is TERRIBLE!!!  Their theory is the issues are the manufacturer's issues not theirs!  After all the issues we've had they should be bending over backwards to try and help...especially since our unit is still under warranty and they could care less!!!!
3,5,"Five Star Plus,
My wife and I live in our RV on a full time bases. Like all things mechanical, issues will arise. We had two separate issues to deal with and we needed to find a certified RV dealer that could  look at and repair the problems at hand. We contacted Blue Dog RV in Las Vegas and spoke to Tim in the service department. We anticipated a long drawn out affair trying to get our repairs completed in a timely manner, we were wrong. Tim quickly set up two appointments to have the repairs done at the Vegas facility. We had our damaged exterior ladder removed and replaced in about an hour. The second apoinment was required to repair a faulty converter, once again about an hour later the work was completed. George the service tech that did the repairs on both occasions has over 25 years experience repairing RV's of all types with the accent on electrical problems. His knowledge and experience are evident based on the quality of his work. As long as we are in the Las Vegas area, we will continue to use Blue Dog Las Vegas for our RV repairs and service needs. Blue Dogs facility is immaculate having a great show room and selection of RV accessories. 5+

3,1,"Please read before considering this place.
This was the worst sales experience of my life. I seen a trailer I liked on the Internet and went to view it. I put money down to secure it and a week later I was told that they were not in possession of the title and this could take days to weeks to secure. How does a dealer sell an rv/ camper without a title in hand and not even tell you up front that it's an issue?? I told the manager and salesman I needed the trailer in a week for a trip. 4 days before the trip it still was not a secure deal and I had to either back out of the deal and rent an rv or they would get the title for me. 2 days before the trip they call and act like they went above and beyond to get this done but it was too late I had to go with a guarantee deal elsewhere. This was a horrible experience and I don't wish it upon anyone. Do not even look at this place please!"
3,1,"Our gripe with Blue Dog Rv is very similar to every single 1 star rating review on yelp. We bought a new 5th wheel toy hauler from them. When we took it camping, we discovered what a piece of junk it was. Our old 5th wheel, purchased used, was in better shape than the thing we bought from Blue Dog. Grey tank and black tank labels were mislabeled. A/C didn't work. Shower leaked water all over the floor causing the flooring to bubble up. Screws popped out all over the place. Maybe this is normal for a brand new 5th wheel? If it is I might as well have bought used. Then to top it off I hear my husband talking to the service department and what a joke....sounded very unorganized and disheveled. They are overworked and can't keep up with the demand of service. Overall I am unsatisfied with this store and do not recommend them to anyone."
3,1,"First things first, TRAVEL NURSES and any potentially RV buyer*******
DO NOT BUY a RV at BLUE DOG

This is for any potential camper and travel nurse. 
I am a travel nurse and live full time in my RV.  I came to Las Vegas and wanted to upgrade my rig, so I went to Blue Dog. First time My husband and I visited Blue Dog, the sales people were very rude and when I asked them for a price on a RV they said that they were not sure what the price was and asked me what kind of car I drove. Frankly, I did not think my car had anything to do with what the price of a RV should be. This made me feel uncomfortable that a sales person would not even have a price for the RV, so I left. 

After shopping around for a few weeks, we decided to return to Blue Dog to give them another chance. We found the rig we wanted. 
We went through the process and bought it. 

*****THEY CHARGED US THOUSANDS MORE THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL PRICE WAS!!! 
We found out that they did this on day of delivery and since they already got their money, they would not refund the difference!!!!! Corporate was called and did not stand behind the actual price but that is not unexpected due to the fact that they did not return our call for over a month. Corporate states that our trade in was not good enough even though it was appraised for thousands more than what they gave and was in excellent condition!!! They stated that the rig was broken and that cat hair was everywhere, well, We don't have a cat and nothing was broken on the rig-- so now they are making things up. Sooo many lies!!!!! 
Most poor customer service that I have ever experienced in my life!!!!
This is where it gets real fun-----
First of all they prepared the incorrect rig but we had waiting a long time so we ended up just switching out furniture and taking the rig that they prepared. 
When they did the walk thru, they rushed thru it and did not explain anything so we did not get any training on the rig. 
The person that delivered our rig was good( hence the one star)
When the rig was delivered we noticed that the wood trim  cover on the ceilings were coming off, the TV hook ups were backwards, the kitchen plumbing had to be redone, cabinet doors were not adjusted and  were uneven, water was never hooked up to refrigerator like we were told and the fireplace did not come with remote like we were told that it would. 
Again, very poor customer service and as soon as we had it purchased it became worse!!!!

Please pass this forward to anyone looking to buy a RV, believe me, we pass this on to everyone we know and run into shopping for a RV!!!!"
3,1,"Terrible terrible service. Will never buy there or recommend them. They don't acknowledge when you walk through the door, they don't ask of you need any help, ignore you and walk right past you when you ask a question.  I would give 0 stars but that's not an option"
3,1,"I would not tell any one to go to blue dog rv for anything after going to there rv show the first camper I went in they had opened up the cabinets  to hold up the ceiling , the next one the doors fell off the cabinets when they were opened , the next one the door know fell off when the salesman open the door and he said o that happens all the time , so my wife and I left"
3,5,"We are traveling cross country for two years and were visiting Vegas for several weeks. We were having some warranty issues with our brand new Keystone that we bought in another state. Initially, due to Keystone's website we were directed to a competitor (Johnnie Walkers) and we had THE WORST experience there, more than once, but because they were warranty items we felt forced to use them. Only after complaining to Keystone about how we were treated at JW were we introduced to Blue Dog and WOW, what a major night and day difference.

Right off the bat Blue Dog was so welcoming and friendly. Literally, right from the minute we walked in the front door. We have been back several times since and never once were we made to feel that we were inconveniencing them or that our business wasn't appreciated. And they have a great deal of parts and supplies in stock. 

The real gem however has been our experience with Tim in service. He was so helpful, patient and knowledgeable, he also facilitated conversations with Keystone, and discussed different upgrades we could make. Tim's communication, follow-up and customer service were top notch.  He even worked us in when we were having A/C issues because we're full-time and have our 6 year old with us. 

The service Tim provided, and our over all  experience with everyone at Blue Dog has been superior to any of our experiences with other dealerships across the country. So glad we found them!!"
3,1,"Went in December 31st to the Las Vegas showroom. Found the trailer that was perfect for my wife and I. After doing the credit, valuing our trade, and getting a round about down payment and monthly payment, we were sold. Had to wait until the banks opened to get approved and financed for sure. Waited until Tuesday afternoon, no word, Wednesday salesman said definitely know by tomorrow. Thursday morning salesman called we are approved at this rate and this monthly, just need this amount down. Finally 9 days later we were ready to pick up our trailer. During the walk thru, we were interrupted by a service guy ""hey your distribution hitch is missing a pin, you have to buy a new hitch"" I'm a little heated at this point about the way he came across. I said no way since I paid about $400 for the one I've been using already. Miraculously, another service guy says ""we can fix this"" don't remember that guys name but was the nicest person there. THEN the salesman comes out and says they have to charge us labor AFTER they switched the hangers from the old trailer to the new one. Now I'm hot, I said no, that's not okay to charge me AFTER THE work was done. Now to financing. The monthly quoted was $40 less than what they wanted on the loan. Over 120 months of financing, that's  $5000.00 more than we expected. At this point I'm done! Took them a half hour to get my truck back to me to hook up my trailer and leave. I run a storage facility, that is a part of 54 locations from California to Texas. They pissed off the wrong person that could have sent so much business Their way."
3,4,"We were greeted by a very friendly woman, who asked a few qualifying questions.
She introduced us to Nelson.
Nelson was outstanding. Young guy, very capable, and knows his RV's, having worked for one of the competitors for several years. He asked all the right questions, and mostly had the answers. My wife and I really enjoyed our experience with Nelson and look forward to completing a purchase with him.

The *only* reason that this place didn't get 5 stars, was that I walked over to the Parts dept to purchase a part. The three parts guys were debating Trump and Clinton. I stood there behind them for a good 5 mins and finally the biggest of the three says ""You look like you have a question?"" I told him I did, but before I could ask it, the fat guy behind the counter started back in on Clinton/Trump. I stood for about 30 seconds more and walked away. George came over and says ""I'm punched out, but I'll try to help you."" I responded that I wanted to give my money to a business that wanted my money rather than blow me off for a meaningless political debate. Fat guy waddled over and asked what I was looking for, and didn't have a clue what I was describing. I finally had to go over to one of his display units, pull out the part I needed, and show it to him. He'd ""never seen that before."" 

Strange, as half the coaches in his store have the same part.


[edit 8/29]
Today I received a ""Thank you"" followup email from the salesperson we'd spoken with. He not only referred to the units he'd shown us, but also had a suggestion for an upgraded unit that Blue Dog doesn't currently have in stock. Super, super impressed with this place and with this sales person in particular."
3,5,Blue Dog RV is by far the finest RV dealer in Las Vegas. If you want a no pressure sales experience with an honest and respectful young man ask for Nelson. He took care of me all thru my sales process and beyond. He's the best. After the sale you'll find a dealership that stands behind their products and their customer. Tim in the service department stepped up and went above and beyond for me when I found myself in a tough spot and I will not forget what he did to assist me. Thanks Nelson and Tim.... you guys have earned a friend and a customer for years to come.
3,5,Derek and the staff at BlueDog RV helped us find and purchase our Springdale coach. Top notch service and professional sales.
3,1,"Blue Dog RV in Las Vegas misled us to make a sale and doesn't feel bad about it.

We purchased a brand new toyhauler from Blue Dog RV in Las Vegas. We wanted the ramp to also serve as a party deck. At the time of sale we were told it would be an easy fix, we'd just have to get some cables to support the ramp. After the sale, we're told we'd actually have to replace the entire ramp for several thousand dollars!

We spoke to the GM of the Las Vegas location, and we emailed Blue Dog RV's upper management. They have never responded to us.

We love our new toyhauler, but hate how misled we feel and that Blue Dog RV didn't even have the courtesy to acknowledge some of their brand new customers."
3,1,"We are going to be in Vegas for 3 days at the end of the month (2 weeks away) and found a Grand Design dealership there.  We have a 2 month old new 44 foot rv under warranty with two broken window latches.   I sent photos to them and asked them to order the correct parts so we could get them fixed while in Vegas.   The service technician received the photos and could clearly see what we needed, but the service manager said ""no.  We have to inspect them before we can order the parts and then the parts will take a week to come in"".   We checked with Grand Design, the manufacturer of this $100,000 unit and they said ""we deal with photos and part orders all the time like that"".   This service manager just knocked their dealership out of some money.   I found a dealership in Phoenix that will do what we requested a week after that when we go through Phoenix."
3,1,"Well guess what I am back.
What a nightmare.
Now the bedroom wall in our brand new trailer is falling off again.
6 times back to dealer for repairs for them to only fix one at a time.
We have only taken it out 1 time in 5 months as it has been in shop 6 times and now sitting in the sun in Las Vegas when it's 100 degrees outside.
This place is a nightmare.
I am going to demand a new trailer and take this further.
This trailer is a lemon and the service department is horrific!!!!
This was a horrible experience and continues to be.
Channel 13 where are you as I need your help and channel 5 I need your Rant."
3,5,"We couldn't be happier with our experience at Blue Dog RV. Our initial 18 month plan was changed to a 6 month plan thanks to the guidance of Caleb. The staff was fantastic and we are looking forward to our continued relationship with each of them. Thanks Blue Dog, we love our 2017 Grand Design Reflection. Thanks from Tim and Veronica Shirlock"
3,5,"My sister and I bought an RV trailer 16 ft in Las Vegas Nevada our first.    We couldn't have had a better Sales rep was Raymond Juvera, we put him thru hell and winded up given him our business, he went way beyond for us new owners.    If and when we are ready to upgrade we will be back to see Ramen again and Bluedog RV.    Please do if you go there to look for an RV ask for him you have the best experience."
3,1,"Well here we are again.
They Replaced our new trailer for another lemon.
Took our 2nd new trailer in the last 5 monthes from Blue Dog out camping this weekend.
We set everything out and connected everything.
After 3 hours the air conditioner was not working and it's 106 out.
We called Blue Dog for them to only tell us bring it in.
Really???
We are camping.
They would not help us out at all.
The warranty you get from them that's says it's forever is very limited so please read closely.
We should have shopped around more.
Take my advice, shop around.
Not real happy again as this is horrific!!"
3,5,"If you are looking for anything RV related these are the key people you need to deal with at Blue Dog RV... First and foremost ask for Jared Munk as soon as you arrive, he is the best sales person we have had the pleasure of dealing with. You will leave feeling like you have made a new friend, he is not only professional, knowledgeable, attentive and will shoot you straight without feeling any pressure when making your decision!! 2nd person when you have found the perfect purchase, deal with Caleb, Sales Manager another professional key person!  Then when you have agreed on your deal and you need to wrap up the financing.. Yes i know everyone hates going to finance and contract managers as they keep you in there forever.. well not this person Sarah, she is a true caring individual and very professional and Fast!!! Lastly when you go to pick up your new baby, make sure your PDI and instruction is handled by George, this man was the icing on the cake, he answered all our questions, took his time and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. I have to say when leaving Blue Dog RV, Las Vegas you have the happiest feeling knowing you have made the right decision and had come to the right place. Even the after service follow up is amazing, Service Advisor Tim called us and then to ensure our satisfaction after the sale a week later a man named Tim Johnson called. Its a truly awesome experience.... Believe me, we have searched high and low, been to many dealers, spent many hours and come across many key people in the RV world but none to the degree of expertise as these people. Follow our advice you will not go wrong believe us. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!!!! :)"
3,5,"We recently bought a Used RV from Blue Dog RV in Las Vegas. We had been looking for a while and had been to dozens of dealers across NV and CA. Have to say Nelson B and the team at Blue Dog were outstanding! They were kind, accommodating, honest and communicated very well. We had anticipated having to trudge through a horrible buying experience en route to realizing our dream of having an RV. Nelson, Wayne and Bill made the experience super pleasant, no games, no tricks! Our family really appreciated that!! The showroom is very family friendly and you can tell they care about the customer. 
Thank you Nelson!!"
3,5,"We've visited this location twice! Everyone has been so nice and welcoming....totally opposite of my service at Camping World. 
I had so many questions as a first time soon-to-be RV owner and Jim answered all of them. He didn't make me feel stupid for asking questions and was willing to show us as many RV's as we wanted to see. He even explained the differences among them all! Great experience all around."
3,2,"Unimpressed with yet another RV service center. I do have to say, on a positive note, some of the best communication I've experienced. Had my RV there for service and also for some extended warranty issues. Only one repair was covered (recall) but the others were on me (or so I was told). I live several hours away and was informed that the work requested was complete. When I went to pick up my rig, I found that not to be the case. My service writer actually took the time to make some last minute repairs. My biggest concern was when I first arrived, they had my generator running (I had it serviced but they never documented the hours). As I walked in front of my rig, I overheard what sounded like a hissing noise coming from the front near the generator. Upon closer inspection, the regulator was leaking propane! Now mind you, the rig was not that old and it was fine when I dropped it off. They made me a ""deal"" on the regulator and did not charge me for installation. Either way, with the hot generator running and right next to the propane leak, I'm thankful I'm not shopping for a new rig! 

I'm losing faith in anything ""after the sale"" when it comes to RV's. The place was clean and the staff was nice but there are certain areas that need attention. Those things that I asked them to complete appeared to have been completed (with the exception of those items I listed above). I am still experiencing some of the same issues I had before dropping it off. Due to having to wait for the additional work, I got back on the road much later than I had hoped. Certainly not the worst RV service experience but by far, not the best either."
3,1,"Well 2 weeks after my last review nothing was done to repair my travel trailer.
We again had to call them for an update as they never reached out again.
They still know nothing.
They say it's a warranty issue.
Well what they told me when we purchased was that everything was covered for life.
REALLY???
My poor trailer has been out 2 times camping but back in shop 3 times and will need to go back again.
If you like this kind of service you sure will get it at Blue Dog.
I will never refer them to anyone, EVER!"
3,1,"2/17 bought our first motor home Nelson was awesome. The service department don't know a thing. Had to take it back 3 times to get done finally getting it home patch up to go and the fuel pump is out payed out over 1,000 to fix which kaylup the manager said would reimburse us that was 4/28/17 still waiting on check it gets better we have no title yet so Dmv tells me there's  lien holder we payed cash manager calls us a lair says we took out a loan because they screwed up he put it on us . Still waiting on check the manager lies I won't ever refer them"
3,5,"Drove from California to get our 1 year check up on our trailer. Dropped off w no problems. Brakes needed and parts were ordered, installed and were on our way! Thanks Denise! See ya next year!"
3,5,"THAT SERVICE DEPARTMENT THO...

The place is absolutely huge! Beautiful facility and the employees are all super friendly. If your looking to get Service work done or need to buy parts, this is the place!"
3,1,"I don't write many reviews but I have to on this one. I went there today to buy a trailer, we found one. We ran our credit, after a little negotiation we agreed on our down payment, monthly payment and interest rate. We were excited and everyone was congratulating us etc... Here's the bad part... We go up to finance and he tells us I don't know what they were thinking we can't approve you for those terms here's what we can do. Our interest rate, payment and down payment ALL TRIPLED. I have decent credit and this trailer payment was going to be more than my cars and almost as much as my mortgage. AVOID THIS PLACE. Not one apology and was treated like a piece of garbage on my way out. Go somewhere else"
3,5,"Jeremy and Bo were Great to work with! Purchased a Momentum 381m last month, the RV has worked flawlessly and got a great deal from them even purchasing out of state, all the paperwork was seamless and had great followup. I highly recommend Blue Dog RV"
3,1,"This review should have been done long ago but I've been trying to be patient with them and the people at headquarters in Post Falls Idaho.   We bought our fifth wheel trailer from them back in May of 2017. while doing the paperwork for our new trailer the finance person highly recommended a product they call Armorguard.  A protectant for the exterior paint as well as the interior, awnings and undercarriage.  This all came with a 5year warranty and a hefty price tag of $2,800.  I have a friend that had a protectant of some sort on his motorhome that he loved, so we decided to purchase.  ""Big Mistake""...  We purchased this fifth wheel after being hit and our old trailer being totaled on our way back east.  So we were late getting to a job and needed the trailer so after waiting a few days after our purchase so that they could prep the trailer and apply this armor guard stuff we went to pick it up.  I noticed that the trailer didn't look all that great and I was expecting it to sparkle for $2,800 so I asked them about it and they said that they had applied the product.  I then asked so you applied it to the undercarriage?  No we don't do that?  I then asked what about the awnings?  No we never do that?   frustrated and late for a job I was in charge of in Texas we left.   So over the next couple of months I talked with service a few times asking them about the Armor guard and how we could get this taken care of.  I was assured that we could set up a service appointment and it would be taken care of.  So late November we took the trailer in so that the Armorguard and several other items could be taken care of.  Six weeks later I picked up the trailer as we has pre arranged the pick up because I needed the trailer for another job.  when I called them the week before I was to pick it up they acted like they had totally forgotten about me and still had to get approval for other items to be fixed?  I told them I had to pick it up that next week, so I was told they would do what they could and I'd have to bring it back?  But they assured me they would get the armor guard done and anything else they could.  The day I picked it up they were supposed to install a circuit board on my water heater and then call me so I could pick it up.  I went in at 2;30 and they were installing the circuit board but when I asked if they had done the armor guard?  no one supposedly knew if they had or had not done it until about 4 when they told me that they hadn't done it ""uggg"" so then I told them to just refund me my money they said oh I can't do that but we'll get on it right away and get you outta here by 5?  originally when I purchased the rv they said that it took about 6 hours to complete because they had to clean and then apply?  
I again left and have been talking with their headquarters but now I'm getting the run around from them!!  I feel as though I've been robbed!!!  How can you pay $2,800 for something and then not get it?  And then you give them 6 weeks to make it right and still not done!!!   Can I call the police?  The district attorney?  Something needs to give!!!  I should be refunded the $2,800 dollars!!!  Be afraid... Be very afraid!"
3,5,"I was only going down there to look. Neal Sorensen showed me the perfect unit and I shouted ""I'll Take It!.

Afterwards I had second thoughts because of another project I was working on. Neal worked very hard to get me an amazing deal, so good in fact I went through with the purchase anyway. 

It was a great touch to hear from a national concierge to verify that I was happy with the people, product and the process. Nice personal touch Tim Johnson!

Continuing all the way through the walk around, I have been impressed with thorough professionalism at Blue Dog in Henderson, NV. Keep up the good work!

Charlie Shoemaker."
3,5,"The staff is very friendly here, and our visit was pressure free.  We had a positive experience with Jared and Caleb.  I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking to purchase a RV.  Great place, and great people to work with!"
3,1,"Horrible experience from start to finish. Our salesman told us he was really bad at this and that should have been our first clue. He was awful. Gave us final #s, gave us a payment amount and nothing matched with finance.  Tried to charge us 1 hour of service on a new delivery because they had to do a little extra work. Told my husband he would have to buy a new hitch when the one we have is 6 months old.  Just a shitty experience from the start. We will never do business here again and we will convince anyone that will listen not to either. They keep treating people this way with bait and switch and they will be out of business real quick."
3,1,"My husband and I went in to look as we are in the market to purchase in the next couple of months. We had a very nice salesman, Jerry. He took us around on the golf cart and showed is many options. He showed us a travel trailer that was on sale. It wasn't exactly wanted we wanted so we kept looking. We found one that we liked that was 8,000 more than the sale trailer and were considering our options.  Jerry spoke with his sales manager and said he offered the trailer we liked for the same price as the one on sale. We called jerry a few days later explaining we were trying to pay off some bills and we would be ready to purchase at the end of The month. Jerry asked us to come down and a least put a deposit down because if they sold out, they couldn't guarantee that price on the new units. We went in yesterday to verify the deal and put a deposit down. Jerry talked us into starting the paperwork and try to purchase. We verified the price and moved forward.  After waiting more than an hour he came back with an apology and a price that was 7000 over our original quote (that we verified twice now) The sales manager that gave us that quote just assumed they could do the same deal as the trailer on sale but he had failed to check the computer. I'm so upset because they ran out credit knowing they couldn't do the agreed on price. They kept us waiting knowing they couldn't do the agreed on price. Jerry is a nice guy and I felt he was honest but why didn't he verify the price before the paperwork was entered in the computer? I'm so frustrated that we wasted an afternoon and have a hit on our credit for a lie."
3,1,"My experience with Blue Dog RV in Las Vegas, NV
My wife and I had been looking for months for the perfect RV for our family. On April 26th, 2018 we walked into Blue Dog RV in Las Vegas, NV and met CJ Klimer. He was very nice and set out to find us a trailer that met our needs and budget. We looked at several that didn't quite fit and then CJ said ""let's see what we have in the back"" he drove us back to a 2016 Jayco X213 and after going through it we were hooked. We looked at several more over the next 2 weeks and decided this was the right one for us we went in and looked at it one last time. As we did not need financing we made an offer and CJ countered the next morning on the telephone. We came back with another offer the next day and CJ told us, ""Sorry, that coach was sold, last night."" Back to looking. The next day CJ called and said he had great news, the financing from the other buyers had fallen through and if we were still interested he would sell it to us for the price they were asking. I drove to the dealership and put money down and signed all of the paperwork on Friday May 4th, 2018. 
I was contacted by Brian from Blue Dog RV on  May 7th , 2018 to schedule my walkthrough/purchase. We scheduled for May 16th, 2018 at 9:00AM. I checked in with CJ via Text MSG on May 11th, 2018 and asked for the status. I was told everything was good with the coach and he would talk to Brian in Service the next day. On Monday May 14th, 2018 I stopped to take a measurement and show a friend the trailer, it was in service and we had to get escorted to see it.
On May 16th, 2018 I walked into Blue Dog RV at 9:10AM with my wife and my 77 year old father to pick up my coach. It was not in the showroom and we were 10 minutes late, so I knew something was wrong. When we asked the receptionist she went to check. CJ was there chatting with Mark, so I asked him where my trailer is? He went to check and came back with Mark to explain that due to some military paperwork being dated incorrectly they had not yet received the title and that we would not be taking the trailer home today. I asked when, and they could not answer.

So here is my problem.  
-Blue Dog RV had nearly two full weeks to fix this problem. They did nothing.
-Blue Dog RV had nearly two full weeks to let me know there was a problem, and not ONE employee reached out to me to tell me there was a problem. 
-I inquired multiple times about the status and I was told everything was fine.
-Blue Dog RV sold me a trailer that they obviously could not legally sell AND told me they sold it to someone else only to later say the financing fell through. 
-I inquired multiple times and no one at Blue Dog RV stated there was any issue.
-I did everything I was asked, and took time off work to pick up my trailer. I made plans for the weekend with the expectation that I had nothing to worry about.

After several days I contacted the corporate office and then got a call from Brian to schedule our walkthrough. This was the first contact I had had with them since the missed delivery date. 
We meet George who is going to do our walkthrough and we notice immediately that our LED lights are hanging off the side of the coach. George assures us that it will be taken care of before we leave. As we start the walkthrough we notice a foul smell coming from the coach? George checks and realizes that the black and grey tanks are both 1/3 full turns on the vent in the bathroom and shuts the door. We continue the walkthrough. There is water coming out of the outside shower..someone left it turned on this make me think that the freshwater tank perhaps has not been emptied or sanitized? This coach is being purchased and no one emptied the tanks???
 We run into CJ (the first time we have seen him today) he asks if we need anything and seems to ignore the fact that they missed our delivery date. No apologies, and no mention of the promise to ""compensate"" us for the mistake of the missing title problem and never telling us and causing this delay. When we were there both Mark and CJ mentioned compensating us for our loss of time and the error of no one notifying us. We didn't ask, they offered.
George shows us the repairs he promised are done and they tow the coach to the parking lot to be ""dumped"" they dump the black and grey tanks as I watch the brown fluid pour from my new investment I feel ill wondering how long that had sat in that tank. 

My advice, never ever buy anything from Blue Dog RV it was the most miserable buying experience of my life and as a customer they have done absolutely nothing to make me feel valued. If I could have found this coach ANYWHERE else I would have bought it elsewhere. I've owned the rig two weeks and have not received any follow-up from them at all."
3,5,I cant tell you how much I appreciate the people at Blue Dog. They had my coach in and out of service before I could even get a drop off date at Camping World. Mr Michael Gilsdorf was a pleasure to deal with. He understood our concerns and was able to answer any questions we had. Thank you Blue Dog RV you have definitely earned our business.
3,5,"If your looking for an RV or trailer this is the place to go - plenty of inventory, friendly no hassle salesmen, professional operation and they even have popcorn, coffee and cookies to help you during the decision making process. The guys in finance explained everything with options and did not add any ""last minute"" add in's. On delivery day the greet you with a lanyard that depicts your name and purchase in addition to a bill board announcing your purchase. A specialist goes over the whole coach top to bottom and answers any questions along the way. They even power up everything and fill tanks to insure faucets work and nothing leaks. You just can't go wrong - ask for Mike as he is a great salesman and person."
3,1,"The worst experience ever!!!
Our brand new travel trailer has been in that shop more then it has been camping :(
Took it in again for the 3rd time on the 16th of May 2017 and today is the 23rd of May 2017 and they have not touched it.
These RV's are suppose to have a lifetime warranty.
Come to find out it's only repairs that they approve to do even though there issues with the product, holes in canopy, floor coming up and walls warped and tape they use as molding falling off, missing caulking, broken table with stripped screws, and more.
They tell us they are so busy, well to me that means they have a lot of repairs with the inventory they sale.
We had an appointment on the 16th and it's the 23rd and it's still there and has not been touched.
This is the 3rd time and we have only had a few months and its brand new.
This is not acceptable and I will be contacting the manufacturer.
They made it sound so wonderful, well it hasn't been."
3,1,"Well guess what again ????.
It is now 8 times we have had to take it back and twice in the same day.
This place is a joke.
The wall that was falling off and they said they fixed well after picking it up and getting it back to storage the wall fell off again!!!
This is crazy as this trailer is 4 monthes old and has been camping one time but back in shop 8 times!
Seriously!!
I am taking this place to the media and higher up.
If you buy a trailer here be prepared as their customer service is the worse I have ever encountered.
The warranty they promise does not exist and they bandaid all repairs.
My trailer is a lemon and it will be replaced.
I am going to make sure this does not happen to anyone else.
Summer is passing us by and that is the reason we purchased so we could enjoy camping this summer.
What a nightmare and what a shame.
They should be embarrassed and ashamed for the way we are being treated.
But by the looks of it they really don't care."
3,5,"Chris Koenig and blue dog RV team were great, patient and knowledgeable. We were able to take our time and compare to finally make a decision with a deal we couldn't say no to."
3,1,"Get your deal in writing!!!  We tried to purchase a trailer from Blue Dog RV, but ended up walking out in disgust.  They kept saying they wanted to work with us and they will do what they could to make a deal work.  They made us an initial offer on a Friday morning, we left to think about it and returned that afternoon to accept that offer, to find that it had changed.  We talked about it and decided to except the new offer with a promise to return the next morning to do the paperwork.  We showed up the next morning, got up to the Finance office and there was another $1000 added on the contract.  Even our salesman was shocked!!!  We had had enough of Blue Dog RV and walked out.  Will Morris our salesman was good and did what he could, but Caleb Gray, the General Sales Manager is incapable of putting a deal together.  Gives new meaning to ""used car salesman"" tactics."
3,5,"I really recommend this RV company!  My husband and I were treated like family by John Valenti and Clinton Mock from the moment we arrived.  We were just looking to see about buying a new RV and the offer they gave us was amazing.  If you are looking for a new or used RV, check them out!"
3,5,"Ryan sold me my forest river evo ats 200rd and we couldn't be happier. This is the only place I can recommend purchasing any rv or travel trailer. Their no pressure sales team combined with awesome customer service and a very helpful service department is the best in town hands down. I've made my rounds but we found our home for rv sales and service. Thank you Ryan and Blue Dog RV for catering to our needs. 
If you need any more help choosing Blue Dog just ask about their lifetime warranty which was included with our purchase!"
3,5,"A huge thank you to our sales person Mike High, Tony s d sales manager Kevin at the Blue Dog RV company today. we received  fast, friendly and excellent service as we purchased a trailer from them today"
3,1,"This had to be one of the worst experiences.  

First our salesman, M,  passed us off because we wanted to look at a ""used"" unit we saw on line,  to J, the ""expert.""  
The ""expert"" lacked knowledge to basic questions, like, ""where is the propane? ""
When we asked The ""expert"" to see a shorter unit, he dropped us off with his golf cart in 110* heat and left!  
15 minutes later he never returned.  So much for questions on a unit we planned to purchase with pay cash. 
We walked back across the sales yard and J actually was kind enough to offer us a water as we walked to the truck. 
Blue Dog, the RV place that doesn't want to bother to sell RVs."
3,1,"We had a nightmare experience dealing with Blue Dog. The only reason we took our brand new trailer there, was due to the good ratings it had. Funny, they must have been coerced or paid for, because we did not have a good experience at all. Our 2016 trailer (this took place 1 year ago, when it began), had a leaky shower, awning issues, leveling jacks not holding pressure, water pump not hooked up right, etc. Funny how you pay an arm and a leg for these things, and right off the bat they have issues! Anyway, it was under warranty, so we dropped it off. It took months for the manufacturer to 'approve' certain repairs, flat out denied our leveling jack issue, which lead to the jacks giving out completely, and crashing down, and now they're bent..........anywho, while the shower was being repaired, they broke our shower door, so they had to order a new one of those, all this takes many months, as the manufacturer is NOTORIOUS for being sloooooow. So, next thing we know, we get into a car accident with our tow vehicle (illegal hit us), so our tow vehicle is out for months. We let Blue Dog know this, and at the time, the manager, Tim, was very nice and sympathetic, no problem. After all, they had our rv for 7 months working on it and waiting for parts, which by the way sucked, we bought a new rv, and have it for less than 1 year, and it's out of service for more than half that time!!! So, we have a lifted truck, and apparently, it's tricky to fix and order parts for, so, what would normally be a 1 month turn around time to get a car fixed, turns into months, through no fault of our own. So, Tim leaves as service manager, goes to another part of the shop to work, I hear, and now this new a$$hole takes charge of the service area. If you've had the distinct displeasure of dealing with him, you'll know. So, we start getting threatening phone calls to come pick up our rv, even though we physically can't. We contact corporate, explain to them the situation, and what Tim had told us ""No problem, I understand, glad you're OK"", so corporate says they back what Tim said, and do not worry about your rv, it will be fine, take as long as you need. So, another week goes by, more threatening calls saying our rv is going to be put out of the street, we're going to start charging you $15/day for storage fees, etc...so we tell the collision shop, we have to pick up our truck, even though they are not done completing all the repairs. We get to Las Vegas Blue Dog, and meet with the nasty manager (Andy or something??, he's a tall a$$hole), we are told our battey is dead, it won't hold a charge. How the hell is it dead, it's less than 1 year old, and we haven't had the dang thing for 9 months now!!! So, the manager gets up from his desk, puffs out his chest, and tells us he's going to call the sheriff!!! WHAT??!! You idiot!! You're the jackass that's been telling your workers to call us and harass us and threaten to put our rv on the street, then YOU kill our NEW battery, and DRAIN our propane tanks, and oh by the way, now our propane regulator is BROKEN, oh AND, you DID NOT replace our awning that was approved and ordered from the manufacturer, but ""hurry up and get your rv off our lot""!!! We got our rv and drove it back to our storage unit, where it sat for about a month, until we could get a chance to go over the 'repairs' and check things out.........that's when we saw that our awning was not replaced. Come to think of it, wouldn't that be fraud??? They either got the part from the manufacturer, and kept it, hoping we wouldn't notice, or they were paid by the manufacturer to replace it, either way, they got something, and we got nothing! I called corporate 3 days ago to tell them our awning was not replaced, guess what?? No return phone call!! I absolutely DO NOT recommend this place, they are horrid, not so bad when Tim was in charge, but this new a-hole (hopefully he's been replaced), is a nightmare, and I can see him causing Blue Dog Las Vegas to lose MANY more customers."
3,1,"So....we flew out from so cal to look at the 5th wheel that had everything we wanted.   Got there and the front was damaged....ok, that can get fixed.  5 days later they decide to give us a credit for us to fix the paint, we agreed.  Drove out to Vegas This morning (memorial weekend) to pick up our new toy.  Well.....we found even more damage to the 2018 rig and oh, that can be buffed out, oh that's an easy fix, don't worry about that were the replies.  Then....it was time to bring in the slides....what's that noise???  Oh, we can get that fixed, it's common.   30 minutes later...not fixed....they offer lunch....my husband and I look at each other and we were like....what???  Then, they tell us they need to take it to the garage to fix it!!!!  It's Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, we had booked an RV space for the weekend to enjoy our new toy, we had our dogs with us....we looked at each other again as we both knew that it was a lemon and we would loose and have multiple problems in the future.  We left and drove home to so cal the same day.  Exhausted and pissed.  They haven't even reached out to us to apologize.   Here is a tip blue dog.....make sure the rig is 100% ready to go and in perfect new condition for your clients to drive away happy and proud....not pissed and frustrated.  We are and will NEVER be a client and hope that others will read this review and reconsider buying anything from you."
3,1,Overpriced junk. New campers with roof leaks and warped flooring. Don't waste your time.
3,1,"My elderly neighbors here in Pahrump bought a new trailer from Blue Dog in Vegas, and it has been a nightmare!!
The fridge didn't work from the start. It has been just under 2 months, and they still haven't fixed it. It is under warranty, but when they finally got Blue dog to send someone out, the guy asked for 1700.oo up front, then ran off with the money. Blue Dog service manager apparently contracted the work out, and that is who stole the money.
When my neighbors contacted Mark, the manager, he said we will give the people they contracted the work out to  till Monday to come up with the money, or else ""I will have our 5 lawyers after them"". Monday came and went, and Mark said they could only come up with 200.00, that they had spent the rest.
Mark said,"" I am giving them tonight to come up with the rest"", and the big boss from the Company was going to be here (from Idaho) and that my neighbors would get their money back, the fridge would be fixed, and they would get the red carpet treatment. My neighbor said she wanted to talk to the big guy from Idaho, and the manager Mark from Vegas said she could.
Tuesday came and went...no contact from Mark or the big guy from Idaho. No fridge. No money back. NOTHING.
This should never have happened. Blue Dog should have electronically deposited the money they were ripped off, by someone Blue Dog contracted out to, on the 1st day.
The fridge should have been fixed or replaced 1st day. My neighbors shouldn't even have to be involved in this. It is between Blue Dog, Vegas..and the RIP off artist they contracted with.
This is an elderly couple who have a 2 month old ""brand new"" unit that has a faulty refrigerator that hasn't worked from the start. 
This is stealing from, and taking advantage of the elderly.
Blue Dogs handling of this has been horrendous.

PEOPLE BEWARE OF BLUE DOG, LAS VEGAS!!!
I wouldn't recommend them to anyone! In fact I will blast this review to all I can!!
STAY AWAY FROM BLUE DOG, their manager Mark , and their service manager. 
Apparently, this company just wants your money, and is unwilling to provide good customer service, and doesn't mind using shady Rip off scam artists to fix your appliances."
3,1,"I hate having to give them such a bad rating but honestly they have not done anything to fix what they did wrong. Long story short: they sold us a product which we requested that it have 1 specific function- a ramp that converts to a party deck. It turns out that it did not have the capabilities for this function despite them selling us this trailer for that very feature and when we tried to seek resolution we were bounced around to multiple people and for 6 months now they are ignoring our requests to fix what they sold us because it doesn't do what they told us it would do.

6 months ago we bought a travel trailer / toy hauler from this location.  We specified we wanted a toy hauler specifically to use the party deck. We looked at several and bought the trailer we have now under their instruction that it's just a small part to add to the ramp door to convert it to a patio. We accepted and asked them to install this part for us, knowing that was the sole reason we selected this trailer was for this deck. Among other minor annoyances (they did not look at the trailer before the walk through so they discovered the electric awning did not work when we did our walk through, no staff to fix repairs when we had been scheduled for our walk through, two weeks for them to repair the issues we discovered at the walk though) they did not address the ramp door converter parts right away. When they did get around to looking into the door they told us we could purchase the parts and they would install it but then they couldn't tell us an accurate part to purchase. THEN they said they couldn't do it, but then came back and said actually  they could and then again that they could not. Basically it cam down to us needing to purchase an entire new ramp door to use this feature. THE ONLY FEATURE WE SPECIFIED WE WANTED! So for 2 weeks of ""owning"" the trailer while they had it in their shop we thought they were able to do this for what should only have been a couple hundred dollars, but now it's several thousand dollars to replace the ramp door. A door which should have come with the functionality we requested in the first place or at least we should have been informed ahead of signing papers was not actually possible as we requested. We would have purchased another trailer with this function had they just told us. They sold us something that doesn't do what we bought it to do and they have been ignoring our emails for 6 months. There have no remorse for selling customers products that don't actually do what they bought it to do and they definitely don't care about customer service!"
3,1,"My experience started at the road show in Henderson at the Fiesta. We just stopped by to take a look because we eventually wanted to buy a Travel trailer. Right when we got there a salesman approached us and took us to the trailers that we wanted to look at. We found one that we really like so after some talk we jumped into it. After filling out the paperwork, we then noticed that the door had a sold sign on it and the salesman had to have saw it when he opened the door. We asked about it and he said it would work for us because we could get a 2018 for the same price. Turns out that was incorrect. It was going to be $5000 more but they gave a few discounts so we were more ok with it. They were going to have to bring the trailer from up north somewhere so it was gonna be a few days. 

Then on Monday we got the call that the loan was approved but interest was going to be over a percent higher. Not happy with it we were still willing to do it. My wife and I are usually only off 1 day a week together. We told them it would be 2 weeks before we could pick it up due to our schedule and the second part of the down payment. They became upset and said that was too long. We moved stuff around so we could get it that coming weekend. Long story short, I had to keep calling them to see if it was delivered. That weekend passed so we were shooting for the next weekend. Finally it was brought in on Wednesday and the guy I dealt with at the road show said that someone from BlueDog would contact me on Thursday. No one did and I tried to call but no answer. I went to the store on Friday and was there a couple hours before they found it and i was told it was not possible to get it that weekend. Our next off day together was in a week and a half. I went home with plans to go Saturday to sign papers. They also told me we had to sign papers and show insurance on it before we scheduled a time to pick it up. So I had to have insurance on it for a week and a half while it sat on their lot. 

Saturday morning we decided to just cancel the order and go to Johnny Walker. The manager talked to my wife and told her we were not going to get any of our deposit back. He then said he would call back and hung up. There was no ""I'm sorry what can we do to change your mind."" Just a ""your not getting money back"" and no call back. We were upset at the interest rate, the horrible customer service, and the lack of communication. Needless to say we would have gotten it after the date they became upset with us picking it up saying it was too long. After a couple days, we got a call from corporate in Texas. He claimed that that isn't how they do business but it obviously is here in Vegas. I really wished i would have looked at the yelp reviews before I attempted business with them. Please go to Johnny Walker RV and ask for Steve."
3,3,"Our agent, Tyler, was very helpful. He even came in early on a holiday to facilitate the sale. The persons in charge of the finances and the RV insurance were of much assistance. However, we are very frustrated with the company's titling department. We were  left us on our own. Our RV registration was expired. We did not receive any call nor follow-up mail or emails for information. We have to do it from scratch: Do all the calls & research on how to get a new registration from an expired one specially with us, who haven't completed our move to Nevada and still residing out-of-state. We hope we will be the last customer with this unfavorable situation."
3,5,"We traded in our 2011 Outback for a new 2019 Imagine. Everyone at the Las Vegas dealership was knowledgeable, helpful, and no pressure. This purchase is our 4th RV. So we have a basis for comparison. Above all we appreciate the honesty of the people we met. For example we were told the truth about duel pane windows, and easy lube axles. About a year ago in Washington state we had a dealership that pressed hard to have us buy a 5th wheel that would have severely overloaded our 1/2 ton pickup. I doubt this would happen with the sales staff at Bluedog. Our salesman was Michael, and the other helpful people were Brian, George, and Jeff."
4,3,"This process here was very frustrating!!! We bought a brand new BEAUTIFUL NEW camper for  $20,000. It was a minor collision wherein the very back end of our camper met with a parked semi truck's fender at a gas station. It tore the back wall out a bit at the very back corner. We were able to use a couple tie down's to hold it in place as we drove a couple hours back to town. 

We contacted another company that offered to waive our $1,000 deductible and wash and wax our camper. We explained that to Premier Coach and was told they too ""would work with (us)."" I tried to verify an amount, and FINALLY after persistence I was told they would reduce our deductible by $400. We weren't thrilled about the offer, but agreed to allow them to provide us with an estimate.

When I got the call that the estimate was OVER $10,000, I freaked!! THAT is crazy that we just purchased this incredible whole camper for $20,000 and to repair the small amount of damage is over $10,000????? I was once again told that they would work with us ""more"" on our deductible. I tried to pinpoint an amount, but he declined to specify. BUT, I felt confident that we could get a few hundred dollars more off because I had explained I was considering taking it to the other dealer for an estimate and I was persuaded not to do so by the ""feeling"" I got that we would be paying less than the $600 agreed to prior. My expectation was three to four hundred dollars, just as the original ""work with us"" discount. Hell, getting our insurance to pay them $10,000 surely left a huge margin! 

I got several emails updating us and providing us with a firm pick up date. That date came and went. A couple days after said date, I called to find out the coach was not ready. I again freaked out because we needed to get our camper into the dealership for it's one year warranty work which was DAYS away from expiring!!! We were asked about the problems we had and were assured they would take care of the minor items.

I provided a list. The blinds were missing end caps and one was missing the wand. The windows stick and are hard to open and close. These were important issues to me. They were NOT addressed whatsoever. When I called to go over our enormous itemized bill, I was reminded that they did our warranty work!!! HA!!! To give them credit, they did replace a door knob that was not working properly. 

I'll give them credit for allowing us to keep the camper there beyond it's final repair completion as my hubby was working an extra hours during a transition that was taking place at his work. HOWEVER, had it been done as promised, we would have been able to pick it up AND get the warranty work done!!

We arranged another date for pick up. We call that morning to confirm that we were picking it up. We were told it was ""not WASHED."" It was supposed to be washed AND WAXED!

We had arrangements to go camping the next day so we needed our camper so we could load it. They did ""offer"" to wash the camper, but it would ""take some time."" They KNEW we were picking it up on this day and it should have been done prior!! We were told it would be WAXED so apparently that promised was not going to be honored, and I'm sure they didn't think we would know the difference had it been washed.

When we arrived, I immediately noticed the camper was FILTHY and I mean FILTHY!!!! I complained to a couple people in the office and the gal at the back desk piped up with her SNOTTY attitude and said, ""I offered to wash it!"" I said, ""It should have already been washed!"" She took her hand with her fingers straight up in an upward motion and gave me a ""fuck you"" sign!! I was shocked at her attitude!!!

They tell us we owe $1,000!! My husband gives them his credit card. I'm saying WAIT A MINUTE!! What happened to ""working with us""? So, my husband would have paid the $1,000 had I not been there!! NOT COOL!! We instead paid $500 when I was expecting to pay far less!!!

So, the guy gives us the keys and sends us on our merry way. What? I would have expected him to do a walk through with us. We did ask if he could look at it with us and he agreed. He was a nice guy.

Well, we attempt to get the camper attached only to realize that they did NOT charge the battery!!! They were NOT on top of having the camper ready for us to pick up!!

Ultimately, they did good work, but the process was beyond annoying and the witch in the office needs to get her attitude in check!

1)  We paid more than expected.
2)  Our camper wasn't ready when it was supposed to be ready, even though I got emails saying it would be ready.
3)  We were not notified it wasn't ready.
4)  Our warranty work deadline passed and work not done.
5)  It was not washed or waxed as promised.
6)  The battery was not charged and it delayed us.
7)  The girl in the office basically flipped me off.

Again, the work was great, so I'm not complaining about the work. However, the repair price was outrageous. Not sure we will use them again if needed."
4,5,"Despite our rocky experience per my previous review, I will upgrade Premier Coach to 5 stars. The manager made a difference. I had asked to speak to a manager when the bitch employee (who apparently no longer works there) pissed me off but apparently she passed me to another co-worker instead of the manager. The manager, Karl, responded to my Yelp review and offered to have our camper detailed inside and out. They did so recently (they sent a mobile unit to our house) and that did help make up for the bad experience.

Premier Coach Works did an excellent job repairing our damaged camper!! The less than great process put a damper on the experience, but not the outcome. I think the manager responded appropriately and tried to make things right. If you use Premier Coach and have an issue, ask to speak to Karl directly. (If it seems like the guy doesn't care, you aren't talking to Karl. You too might have been passed to a co-worker.) I think Karl genuinely cares about his customers' experience and wants them to be happy with the process AND the results!"
4,2,"My 5th wheel broke down 80 miles west of Phoenix and was towed to Premiere coach.  Extensive damage to body. Axle etc...Premiere did excellent work on main body damage and axle.  We live in 5th wheel full time and it took almost 2 months to get my rig back.  I had some other issues like I wanted them to check out my hot water heater.  They had ample opportunity to look at it while they were waiting for others parts to come in but nothing was happening.  I decided to email person coordinating job [was told to handle in this way] still nothing.  I spoke with them a few times, still nothing.  Day before picking up rig they put someone on it and I was told hot water heater was bad, don't use it in electric mode and they turned gas off so I couldn't use it in gas mode either...keep in mind it worked in gas mode when it went in to shop.  Told they need couple days to get new heater and set up.  They really did not want to do this.  They were told to check it out first couple days they had it, I bugged them about it from the start ...almost for 2 months...and they DID NOTHING ABOUT IT TIL DAY BEFORE I PICKED IT UP.  All I got was a 'sorry about that' and I wasn't going to wait any longer to get back to Florida.  This is only one thing of a number of things that made me MOST unhappy with them.  I got hot water heater fixed in couple days by mobile repair guy when we got to our site in Florida.  New heater, simple fix. Premiere just didn't give a S### about it, that simple.  I will give them credit for doing a great job on axle, wheels, body that was pushing out from frame.  All done in great fashion. But be careful of so called smaller things cause they don't seem to care about them.  And make sure you get insurance check and don't pay full amount til all is done.  They work really close with insurance people so be careful...it is most helpful but can work against you so assert yourself to insurance people about check going to YOU!!!!  They will have you sign paperwork and in-bedded in paperwork is permission to cash your check without your signature, it gives them power of attorney to cash. Make sure you don't let them do this because otherwise you have nothing to control them, that was my mistake.  Bottom line is really big things get done well otherwise LOOKOUT.  They will put polymer coating on your RV for $500.00 which is a good thing but not if job is bad.  Mine was done halfway, dirt still on in places and polymer put on over. Not buffed out all over. Job done in hurry. And not in professional manner.   Not worth price paid.  should get money back for this part of work.  A shame a place with so much potential is like this.  And in case you are wondering this situation starts from the top with Matt who is the boss."
4,5,"These guys specialize in RV body work, but they recently worked on my fiancee's Mustang GT with spectacular results!!!

The bumper and fender needed paint and the passenger door had a crease that needed to be pulled and painted. They did it right and removed all the parts before painting, then blended the adjacent parts to match. It looks like a brand new car!

Their prices are very competitive and the staff is friendly and flexible! Highly recommended for whatever body work you need!!! Thank you, Matt and Corey!!!"
4,1,"Worst experience ever; they are slow, unprofessional and did a very poor job. It took two months and several calls to finally get our 2 year old 5th Wheel back. The staff is argumentative and rude, with the exception of one young man we spoke with. Now, we finally have our 5th Wheel and they said there was nothing wrong with our large slider, it only needed grease; well it's in worse shape now and won't open. Although we could have probably taken it back to have the slider evaluated again, we have no faith in their ability to properly diagnose the issue or ability to work quickly to resolve the problem."
4,5,"After many positive recommendations I took my car to Premier Coach Works, and I'm so glad I did. The staff were all super friendly, professional, and helpful which was a huge relief. Great customer service is hard to come by nowadays, but these folks exceeded all my expectations. I had the pleasure of working with Jeremy who was very knowledgeable, pleasant, efficient, and thorough. He got my car back to me quickly and even better than it was before. This place does quality work in a timely manner and best of all it was a painless experience!"
4,4,"Brought my semi here for a simple repair of a leaking power steering component. It was a haul to get there, but so far, well worth the fuel. The semi mechanic, Josh really seems to know what he's doing and seems fair and honest. We spoke about some of the myriad other issues and tweaks my truck needs and I didn't get the impression at all that he was hearing the ding of the cash register as we were talking. When the initial job was completed  he let me know he had followed up researching parts and prices for the other stuff and pointed out something amiss that I had previously been aware of but hasn't mentioned. I'm not sure how he had been able to identify the specific issue visually but he did and was absolutely correct. I'll definitely go back to him again."
4,5,I got my Bmw hood and roof repainted a few months ago because it started to fade. I looked up a local body shop with a lifetime warranty and premier came up. Honestly some of the best service I have ever had in the automotive business and a great price. I would recommend them to anyone that asked.
4,4,"This was thee most frustrating ordeal that happened.  After picking up my car and speaking with you Carl i would like to retrack my previous review.  In the end, you Premier Coach did an amazing job on the body work.  It looks beautiful and I am very pleased with the workmanship.  Its actually ""prettier"" now then before it was damaged.....until I opened the doors.  Do you offer upholstery detailing?   If the upholstery detail is as as beautiful as the exterior detail I would definitely use your services. Amazing job.  In the end all turned out well.  Thank you for the CSG it really help recoup some of my out of pocket rental car cost.  I apologize for the frustration I've put you thru.  Just please understand the frustration I was under.  Once again, Thank you Carl, Kyle and Cindy."
4,1,"No stars! Premier Coach picked up my car. Novenber 17 2015.  Today January 7th 2016.  It might ready tomorrow.  After doing all the body work and paint... the car was ready for ""pick up"" possibly the car doesn't start.  Ok who does that? Lets make sure the car is running right if at all before body work let alone the paint.  I requested a CSG of possibly waiving the deductible.  Per manager can only do $100.  Ok i will take it.  I didn't realize it was going to take almost another whole month before the car was near completion.  I've been renting my own car. At $24 per day on a disability income. Per Cindy in management @ Premier Coach. She was going to make sure i was a Happy customer.  Keep my rental car while she figured out what's going on with my car.  A few days later Cindy is screaming art me over the phone ""we are NOT responsible for your rental!!!""   Nice. .... To this day i have initiated all calls to Premier Coach.  Something I was told by PC would be done. ""We will keep you updated on everything going on with your car""    Bull.  I'm not done yet.  Then again...neither is my car.  ""Maybe"" tomorrow.  We need ""to make sure it runs right""  Arghhh!  Her we go again.  To be continued...Olga"
4,5,Got in an accident and these guys got my VW fixed in no time. Kody was great at handling everything with my insurance so I had nothing to worry about. Highly recommend them!
4,5,"Kyle & Vanessa, and all the staff give wonderful customer service. We recently took our moving truck in for non-cosmetic repairs and when we picked it up, we were pleased to notice the attention to detail in the cleanliness of the truck! Highly recommend them!!"
4,5,"I've visited a handful of other auto shops before going to premier coach works. Let me tell you, the work they perform is quality work! Customer service is a big deal for me and the guys over there were very friendly and very helpful. My car was estimated by this friendly gentleman named Jeremy C. He thoroughly explained what needed to be done and gave me a very reasonable price. If you are looking for great quality for your car and great customer service check out premier coach works. You'll be wasting your time shopping anywhere else!"
4,2,"First, the good news. They did a good job on the body shop repair and the car came back spotlessly clean. The car was detailed very well. 
Now, the bad news. They are unbelievably SLOW and don't communicate well at all. Our rear bumper had received some scratches in a very minor accident. Fix Auto said the repair would take 3 days. We finally got our car back 12 DAYS LATER!!!  Twelve days to do a minor bumper repair. A major repair must take months to complete!
Don't even consider using Fix Auto for a repair unless your insurance company will provide a rental car for a long, long time."
4,5,"I got my car worked on here a few days ago. It was recommend by a friend of mine. The customer service was phenomenal! They definitely went above and beyond to make sure I was pleased. Jeremy was the man who helped me. Jeremy, and the rest of the team were great. Thank you, I will definitely be back in the future!!"
5,5,"Called this company regarding our F250 tranny issues. First of all, they are extremely helpful and friendly over the phone. Scheduled an appt for a FREE diagnostic and they found the issue almost immediately. They went above and beyond with our truck even tightening up our steering column. My husband and I were VERY satisfied. We went in thinking we were going to have to replace the transmission and left with our truck fixed for a very reasonable price. They were honest, upfront, helpful and super friendly. Would highly recommend this company."
5,5,"Sun transmission repaired my leak in a timely manner at (what I thought) was an exceptionally reasonable price. They could have gouged me or made me wait until a week from never (because they are bussssy!), but they did neither.
Also want to give a quick hurrah for the polite way they handled all my questions, especially regarding future transmission needs and maintenance. Great shop!"
5,5,"Amazing service....I took my 04 vw passat to a aamco and was told I needed 3k worth of transmission work. I went to Tony at sun off of a referral from another transmission company he solved my problem in a day No transmission fluid. 40 bucks later I was good to go. When the other company changed the oil in the car they drained the transmission fluid instead of the oil...crazy will send everyone I know to Suns

5,5,"Fast, reasonable service. They could have pretended my car was a lot worse off than it was. In spite of being busy, they had my car finished quickly. They suggested some preventative maintenance, which is something I appreciated because I don't have a lot of car expertise. Overall excellent experience!"
5,5,"These guys are the best I have ever dealt with. They went the extra mile for me and didn't try to Jack me up on the price. Jerry is a good guy, probably one of the last out there. Thanks you guys!!"
5,5,I had some work done on my car today and I am really happy with the service. They were able to complete the service quickly and the cost was very reasonable. When Ed called to tell me what he found he said it could cost way more than it did but he was going to try to fix the problem in a different way. He was able to do it and saved me so much money. His honesty is worth every penny! I will be back if I need any more work done on my car.
5,5,What an amazing experience I had here today!  As a single female who knows very little about cars I am always nervous that I am going to be charged for repairs I have no clue what it even is or if it was done.  Ed Rapp took such good care of me I would recommend these guys to anyone and I wont take my car anywhere else.  My finances are tight right now and he did a minor repair to buy me some time until I could afford the real repairs on my car.  They adjusted belts and topped off the fluids in my car and only charged me for 1 hour of labor.  Fair and very trustworthy repair shop!  Ladies this is the place for you and Ed is a guy you can trust!!!!
5,5,"I hate going to mechanics!! However, Bumper to Bumper was recommended to me by a friend and I've had only good experiences there. I took my car in for a basic repair that only cost me $25, but I expected to pay around $100 for it. I'm glad they were honest and didn't try to upsell me anything...they just fixed what was wrong and did it as inexpensively as possible. Highly recommended!"
5,5,Yet ANOTHER great experience here!  I drive an OLD car and it is a major money pit right now but Ed took care of me again while I waited!  I didn't even have an appointment but my car died on me again today and he got me back on the road!!!  Can't express enough how much I appreciate their honesty and speed!!!  Thanks!!!!
5,5,"Very friendly and quick service, and gave me an alternative to fix my window which fell down and wouldn't roll back up.  Something I could afford, even though my window won't roll down anymore.  I'll take it.   Even topped off my brake fluid without asking, as it was low, and didn't charge me for that.  Thanks, Bumper to Bumper, I'll be back, hopefully not anytime soon."
4,5,"My wife and I went and spoke with Sheri Maloney after we decided we were ready to start looking at RV's.  We talked and decided a 5th Wheel might be our best option but they did not have one in stock with the floorplan we wanted and the price we could afford. We kept Sheri's name and number so we could follow-up with her because I just generally got a good vibe from her.  I definitely should have paid attention to that.

Over the next couple of months we hadn't heard anything and we were actively visiting other dealerships getting a feel for things and looking around.  We made the mistake of going into deals with not one but two other dealerships.  One of them who I won't name put 11 hits against my credit.  The other came back with a downpayment of 25% of the price of the trailer we were attempting to finance.

I was frustrated by all of this and ended up calling Sheri back and making an appointment to go see her.  We went back in and talked with her.  We had changed our thoughts and wanted a travel trailer style.  She showed us two models.  We ran the numbers on the more expensive one.  It came back more than we wanted to have our payments at.  We ran the numbers on a similar model without as many bells and whistles but totally acceptable and it came back perfect.

Dustin the finance manager was an absolute wizard.  With other companies we were waiting 4-7 days for credit decisions.  Dustin had our answer in writing from the bank the same day on a Saturday.

We literally went from walking through to putting the down payment down in under 4 hours on a Saturday.  Most of that 4 hours is because we had a commitment and I had to get some food for lunch on the way back to put the down payment down.

I absolutely recommend ANYONE looking for a RV go see Sheri Maloney at the Johnny Walker RV Outlet Center.  She and Dustin both will absolutely treat you right!!!!"
4,5,"Johnnie Walker outlet was just the place we were looking for. Walker Fitch was our salesman & boy did he know his stuff! We had been looking for a camper for over a year & we let Walker know what our likes & dislikes were & within a week he was calling us to come in and look around at some campers he thought might work for us. Sure enough he hit the nail on the head! He was out standing and the camper was perfect for us! This place is so great that they let you stay the night in their lot in your camper to test everything! That way if you have any problems their technicians are right there to help! Just over & above amazing service!! Everyone that wants an RV should shop at Johnnie Walkers!
Because they care more about your happiness then making a sale!!!! Will never shop anywhere else for RV parts, they are so trustworthy & caring! The technician Jose took over an hour to go over everything in our new camper with us!!!wished we had gone here first because we wasted a year with the other places that really didn't listen & wanted to sale us something they wanted us to buy & not what fit us"
4,5,Happy Campers!  Ask for Sherri you'll be glad you did! Jeannette in finance is awesome also!
4,1,"Horrible experience that will only end in major losses! Purchased a 2018 trailer back in Late October 2017. Fresh off the truck. Had problems with it from day 1. Firstly the sales experience was a breeze. We knew what we wanted. After the sales person handed us off to finish up the the paperwork and collect the rest of the cash our experience went way down hill. We got the keys to our coach and spent the next 4 days trying to get a technician to make some repairs and answer questions. JWRV boast about their ""free schooling"". It's a load of bull. You get a 5m walk through and like I said... spend several days chasing someone down to follow up with. We were delivered to our destination over a day late. When the transporter unhitched the coach, he rolled the front driver side stabilized jack. Shortly after that we realized our water heater was not working properly and we called into Service. We were told by a JWRV technician and Salesperson that the circuit board on these coaches was a re-call. Bad news! After multiple service calls, a full replacement of the suburban water heater, swapping out the LP Regulator and some other tweaks, JWRV FAILED to FIX any of the issues our lemon had. We even had to deal with the constant smell of UN BURNED Propane INSIDE the coach! The issues I have written about are just to name a few. We had multiple conversations with Ken in the service department who tries very hard not to be condescending, but doesn't quiet pull it off. And watch out for his long stories used for distraction and to deliver little life lessons on how to ""settle"" for the lemon they sold you. Ken will also let you know that he has about 100 other people ahead of you on the lot in need of service, and that in all his years of service, no one has ever been made whole in a situation like ours. 
All of this has been a series of unfortunate events that should have been resolved immediately by This establishment. Instead the management at JWRV chose to take the low road run around approach.  I do NOT recommend being your business here to them. I recommend purchasing used, from anywhere else. Don't be fooled by the promise of warranty work because they have no problem adding you to their list of coaches to fix. The owner directly stated that ""when you purchase from them, you should plan to make repairs immediately"".  Check out the other JWRV reviews I have left for more details on our lemon and experience with the dealer."
4,5,"We came from Tucson, AZ to purchase a 2017 Heartland Bighorn.  Everyone we worked with at  Johnnie were GREAT.  We live in Tucson and when we had an issue, the folks at JW stepped in and were great in helping us resolve our problem."
4,5,I would like to thank the staff here at this location they will bend over backwards to get you into the right RV for your needs. I wish to especially thank Mark and Dustin who go the extra mile if not for them and all the staff at the rest of their locations I would have been at a great loss of what do.
4,5,"My sales man Troy went out of his way to find me help what I wanted. If you decide to buy an RV from Johnnie Walker my honest opinion is you could not go wrong by specifically asking for Troy.
Everybody went out of there way to make sure I was served well. Go see the guys at Johnnie Walker RV to buy your next RV"
4,1,We bought our TT and have only been able to use it 1 time since we have had it.  The first weekend we had to cancel our trip and leave after 1 day because the air conditioner wouldn't work correctly so it was hotter inside the TT than it was outside.  There were several problems with it and I took it back to them to have them fix it.  They have had it 2 weeks and we just received a call and they said they will have it another 1.5 weeks at least.
3,5,"We couldn't believe how nice and helpful the owners are.  They guided us into our spot and helped us get set up even though it was over 110° outside.  I would give them 5 Stars on that alone.  They really helped us.  We were only supposed to be there for a week but something came up and we stayed 3 weeks.  Their laundry room was as nice as most any parks we have been in and the couple other guests that we met were also very nice.  Although most of the RV Parks in this area are more just places to park than camp grounds. We had plenty of room for our 38' 5th wheel.   We had good internet the whole time we were there, despite the fact the sign up method is different than most parks.  But the owner told us that's what kept it up and running fast for everyone.   The price was much better than most of the surrounding parks which we liked because we didn't want to pay for a lot of stuff we didn't need like a bingo hall and potlucks.  It is one of the smaller parks in the area which we like and surrounded by Mega Parks with over 2,000 spaces in many of them.  We will be going back there again when we are in the area because of the nice friendly people."
3,4,I just called to see if they allow families to stay. I spoke with Bobby and they do not allow families to stay but he was SUPER helpful recommending some places he did know that would allow families. With the 100's of rv parks in the area many are only 55+. So just on customer service alone I'm a fan of this place!
3,1,"We stayed here for a couple of days. That was enough. They had trouble getting the fifth wheel ahead of us into the very tight space. He had us park the 41 ft RV we have across several spaces which was ok. But, the website and what it actually is are two different things. Owner is very nice but it is a VERY small lot. We won't go back but you get what you pay for."

3,1,"First and for most they are nice people, pet friendly, nice laundry facility, small  and quite. For the price they should offer cable TV (we were told that we could get 42-44 channels with an antennae, we might have got 5 and 3 were Spanish) the landscaping should be maintained better, the spaces are small and you have to park your vehicle there too, the internet should be upgraded and better than it is ( he asked for our numbers on our devices to connect us?) that did not make us feel comfortable accessing some of our accounts. For a park that allows no children he has a lot of rules and cameras to keep track of his adult park. The hook up seemed a little backward as you had to run your sewage to the opposite side of your RV a long distance. We came from another park to this park and for the same money we had cable TV, good private internet, weekly landscaping and more space. We stayed here 42 days. This place worked in a pinch, we travelled for 6 mons in Arizona and was just glad we only had to spend 42 days here."
4.5,1,"Lots of issues from this company. I was hopeful at one point that John (Owner) would have followed through with what he said he was going to do because of all the trouble and issues that took place. But he did not. Details are very long and I don't have the time to get into it. John, if you see this post, I hope in the future you stand by your word on making things right, instead of trying to pass the buck on to someone else."
4.5,5,"He was so polite and no-nonsense. I was suspicious of all the 5-star ratings, but now I get it. Cannot recommend enough."
4.5,5,John came out to the middle of nowhere to help inspect a motor home for my parents and he did such a great and honest job! He was very helpful and super sweet when it came to pointing out all the issues. In the end he saved us a lot of money and it was definitely appreciated! I'll be keeping his number on hand for any mechanic needs! Thank you John!
4.5,5,"Best service we could ever hope for!  Our truck has over 100K miles, and had not had a tune-up in too many years - and really needed attention. Our truck was treated with special care and all was set right.  Having these guys come to your door is a gift.  I would recommend Busted Knuckle to anyone who has a problem vehicle sitting in their driveway. A+++++ all the way!!!"
4.5,5,"John is the nicest most professional individual I have ever met.  As a single mother I frequently get taken advantage of by mechanics, so I am a wary and skeptical consumer.  John saw my daughter and I struggling along on the road late this Sunday evening as I had the bad luck of running over two enormous screws and completely flattening my tire.  John went out of his way and asked if I could use any help.  He should wear a cape, I didn't have a spare so I was really stuck!  In record time this wonderful man patched my tire in the TWO gigantic spots the screws left and I was good to go.  To top it off, he refused to take payment for his hard work.  I honestly didn't even know people like John existed anymore.  I am completely humbled and grateful.  If there is any doubt whether to contact John for services, DO.  He will really take care of you and is a trustworthy and caring individual.  Thank you so much John, I am sincerely a customer for life and will recommend your services to absolutely anyone I know in need of a mechanic for any reason."
4.5,1,"Came out not prepared, No Bootys, Not able to do the Exhaust job without telling me to take it to Cummins so they can own it., looked at oil being slung from front wheels said the Oil bath Hubs were bad and that he charges $700 to replace both, I did agree , ( My fault) ( Trust) He did the job with ( My Bucket) he didn't have one , He left a Mess, Oily rags and my dirty bucket for me to clean and throw away. Also left a mess on the ground with oil. I will probably get a complaint from my Storage Co. Very un- professional ! after further communication with John about his cost and then come to find out the Hubs weren't bad the Gasket was. I even contacted Spartan for the cost of the Hubs with gasket is $88.06 each. $125 hr and 85 service call is way too much!! I told him I was going to bill him a couple hundred for the clean-up and you can Imagine what he said. Be prepared to Pay"
4.5,5,Busted knuckle was awesome. They came and fixed our car and motorhome after they had been sitting for 12 years. They were fast and went above and beyond. Even were available by phone and text when we had questions. Great mechanic.
4.5,5,"I drive from the South end of the Strip to The Lakes at least twice a week for my children's activities; I spend more time on the freeway than on the streets.  Imagine my dismay on 10/14/2015 at about 4pm when I was accelerating as I entered the 215 W on LV Blvd (near Town Square) and my car wouldn't pick up speed!  I literally couldn't get it to over 40 mph, which is suicide on a fast-moving freeway.  Luckily, there was enough traffic that things were at a bit of a slow pace.  I was very nervous, my daughter was in the car as well (we were going to her music lessons), just praying to the universe that I could get off at the nearest exit without my car completely dying.  We exited the freeway safely, I called my husband, he said that he would find someone to look at it and asked if I thought I could get it home.  It was driving ok on the streets, so I told him I could.

Fast-forward to the next day:  My husband had called John the day my car was acting up and made an appt for the next day.  He came by my house in the late morning and got right to work.  He had already purchased the part for the vehicle and didn't have to waste time going to get it.  He was here for a few hours, explained all of the work he was doing in a way that a person clueless about cars could understand and was honest about the pricing.  I was back on the road in less than 24 hrs from my initial problems.  My family will call John first before any other mechanic in town, and I recommend him to everyone I know.  If you need another reason to choose him, he's a veteran.  Support one of our troops who's also a knowledgeable, trustworthy tradesman.  You cannot go wrong with him!"
4.5,5,Really nice guy. Fixed my alternator which is a problem I have been having for quite some time .
4.5,5,"I found John at Busted Knuckle through Yelp reviews. I gave him a call in the evening, and he took the call although he was waiting in line for a table at a restaurant. I quickly let him know what I needed, he said he could be there the following morning, and asked me to text him the details. 

The next morning, John showed up just before the time of the appointment, tested several systems, and came back with a diagnosis in a half an hour or so. I have followed up with him by phone a couple times for details since, and he's been an excellent communicator. 

I'd gladly recommend John and Busted Knuckle, and will use him again if needed. Thanks John."
4.5,1,"I called this company yesterday and spoke with John. I informed him that I have a work truck in our las vegas office that needs quarterly maintenance. We discussed rates and what work needed to be done to the truck. An oil change and a tire rotation. that's it. He agreed to give me a little break on the hourly rate which was much appreciated and the company has many excellent reviews so I decided to go ahead and give them a try. I told him what kind of truck we had before hand figuring that would be useful information for the tech to have. 

So today the tech shows up, on time and then says he has to look at the truck first and then he needed to leave to go get the supplies he needed and would return, which he did. The tech had to go get the oil and filter because he didn't have them with him. This is after we already discussed what truck we have, year, make and model. So then the tech does the tire rotation and oil change, no problems there. 

We then get down to making the payment. I call John on his phone as he is making the tech stay there until he gets payment. I ask how much and he says ""$260.39"". That's right. $260 for an oil change and tire rotation. He said there was 2 hours of labor and he was helping us out by not charging a service fee. My manager informed me that the tech actually only worked on the truck for about 30-45 minutes. I was being charged for the time the tech took to go shopping, for materials that he should have already had. 

I also would like everyone to note that this employee was in his own truck using his own tools and is probably not even an employee. I own a service company and see a lot of this regularly. The work is most likely being subbed out and the tech has to get a cut and Busted Knuckle has to get a cut and like magic, that's how you get to a $260 oil change. God knows how much it would have cost if i was also charged a service fee. 

So yes the work got done, but we we're clearly taken advantage of and my manager let me know the tech clearly didn't want to have to stand there while there was conversation about a $260 oil change. On what planet does anyone think that is ok? 

So if you like to have to pay for a service 3 times over so everyone can get a cut, this is your place. Or if you really want to use them you better make sure to ask a lot of questions about the service pricing and make sure you're not paying someone to go shopping for basic stuff like oil. A specialty part or something not commonly stocked or when you don't know what the issue is, I get that. Not charging me labor time to shop for oil after you already agreed to show up to do an oil change and you know the exact model of the vehicle you are going to work on."
4.5,5,"Called this company for a Mobil repair. We have 4 pets and I have a broken foot so putting our RV in the shop was kinda out of the question! We just got into town last night! The check engine light came on just before we got to the RV park. We called them this morning and they were able to come out this afternoon. Our tech was Shane. Very nice personable young man! Did a GREAT JOB! He had us fixed up in one hour! Little problem finding the diagnostic plug in because our owners manual book didn't have any reference to where it might be so Shane started removing panels to find it! Our problem was an air sensor and an error made by my husband, but it was worth the money spent to make sure our engine was ok for us to get back home. I want to give a BIG THANK YOU SHOUTOUT TO SHANE! We truly appreciate what you did for us!"
4.5,5,"2nd time I've used them. First to check out an RV I was buying and they saved me from being ripped off and now to work on my manifold. Make sure your ok with the service call and paying for the required 1 hr but before you make a decision you need to know these people don't take longer because they are hourly, are HONEST, and great at what they do. Tyler help us this time and John before that. Tyler showed up on time, was easy to deal with and pointed out some other issues for the future that might need repair. They actually repaired what another mechanic said they had repaired and for much less! If you're traveling, like me, they don't take advantage knowing they won't see you again. Thanks again!!"
4.5,5,"I have had a couple things go wrong on my RV, and fortunately for me, they happened while I was in Las Vegas.  Enter Busted Knuckle Mobile Mechanic.   Fast to respond, quick to diagnose and repair.    Excellent service and technician who knows what he's doing.   If you need some help with mechanic repair, definitely give them a shout.    Love having someone I can trust away from home, a go to!!!!

4.5,5,Honest work & does a damn good job! Definitely the man for the job & always available. If you want good work and work that'll last call john!
4.5,5,"John is fantastic he always answers his phone & he's ready on a moment's notice. He goes above and beyond the call of duty and does every job to perfection. You can't go wrong with this guy, best mobile mechanic in town. Kick ass truck and very knowledgable with customer service skills. Comes to you & will help you with anything. If you have an issue, CALL HIM! Busted Knuckle is the best in Las Vegas."
4.5,5,"John was great. My car wouldn't start and after some troubleshooting, I realized it wasn't producing a spark.  I called Busted Knuckle and John came out and checked several things and then told me that I needed a new ECU (computer).  He said he couldn't program the ECU but gave me some advice on finding someone who could.  John is fast, explains what he is doing and honest.  Total cost was $85 for the diagnosis and he even suggested that I check with my insurance to see if I had towing coverage. I didn't think I did, but found out I do."
4.5,5,"Called John at Busted Knuckle up yesterday as needed my rear brakes replaced on my Honda Odyssey ASAP. John was friendly and professional and we arranged for an afternoon meetup today. Happily, John was able to come even earlier which was awesome as I needed the van later and was a little nervous it might not be ready in time. However, no need to be nervous as John arrived exactly when he said he would and in less time than it would have taken me to remove the tires with my ""factory"" jack he had the new brakes in place and everything back together ready to go. I recommend John and Busted Knuckle to anyone looking for friendly, professional service."
4.5,5,"We couldn't have been more please with the response time or service.  Having just dealt with another similar business that provided lousy service and overcharged us, it was refreshing to deal with John.  He was professional, knowledgable, did what he promised and charged us a reasonable price.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!"
4.5,5,I was broke down on the freeway with my friend in his FORD and we called the busted knuckle to come fix the truck and he worked on it on the side of the road while we waited! Turned out the fuel filter was bad and plugged up! Ironically he had a Ford fuel filter on his truck because they go out so often! thanks for getting us back on the road again! will definitely be using your services in the future and recommend anybody broke down in a Ford!
4.5,5,"I called John on Sunday afternoon with a broken water pump and he was at my store first thing on Monday morning. He had it fixed with in a few hours. Very fast and reasonable prices.
I would recommend him."
4.5,5,"Do not hesitate for one moment in calling Busted Knuckle. From the point of first contact, everything was professional and competent. Communication was excellent. John took our call as we were coming in to Vegas with what I thought was a bad power inverter. John showed up right on time, diagnosed our problem as a blown fuse between the battery bank and the inverter. A quick trip to the parts store and we were good to go. You can tell the competence of a technician in a quick few moments. John IS competent in spades. Price was more than fair. Don't look anywhere else."
4.5,5,"Great mobile service! John is always been great to us and my company. Listen I can only speak for experience hear he's always done great job for me and I'll tell yous what it was prefect my starter went bout he was there In minutes and fixed ur up good as new. You know what I think,,, whey these don't kno smooth if the ppl trying to help instead of take out of the ways.

Just leave your paws off it until it don't and you'll be much happier. Asyways great service I'll keep using ya!"
4.5,1,"Total Rip Off Alert!
 ""Run as fast as you Can""
""Not Licensed To Do Business"" In Las Vegas, Clark County, or Henderson
 This Guy, John Fernandes / Busted Knuckle is Not Licensed to do Business!
I would of never of gone this far, but after he started Insulting me and than started name calling me with abusive language I thought I better investigate him further. Then I found out he was not Licensed !  I asked for a full refund, He refused ! I have contacted the Authorities regarding his Business.
 Do yourself a favor and stay away from a Scam Artist Like John and do Business with Only Licensed Businesses. 
As you know form my Previous Post, John left a Total Mess at my Rig at the Storage area, He dumped all the Oil out of my wheels onto the Ground. And he refused to pay me for my bucket and my time to clean up. So John took it upon himself to Go into my Storage Unit Without Permission to continue working /trying to clean up his mess. What do you call it when someone goes into your Storage unit without Permission?? A Break-in??? Because of him getting caught going into my Unit I was almost removed from my Storage from Management.
I informed John of this and He LIED to me!!! He told me he accessed the storage because he might of had a storage unit there. A Outright Lie!
Now not only is John a RIP OFF he is a Liar. When I asked him for His Business License He sent me an Old one that was Closed in January of 2017 for a different Company. Another Scam...

Listen People, we all pay Taxes and try to do Business the right way, This guy is Overpriced,
Not Licensed, Insulting, and does not tell the Truth."
4.5,5,Great guys! Came on time to help me out of a jam. I recommend them to everyone!  Thank you for being prompt and diagnosing/fixing my problem. My car is up and running again!
4.5,5,"This guy is the greatest mobile mechanic ever! Idk how the guy below gave 1 Star. 
He showed up on time, was very professional & very competitive in pricing. 
My younger wife had a real hard time not gazing upon his Big glistening for arms too. 
She also called over two of her friends and they both started hitting on the owner too.

Great work busted knuckle"
4.5,5,"We are over the moon with the work that John provided!  We came into Las Vegas with an overheated engine on our motor home.  He met us on Saturday morning, and worked into the wee hours and got us back up and running on Sunday.  He did a complete hot dip of the radiator and inter cooler and fixed a problem we have had for a long time.  Thank you so much!!!  Next time we are back in LV we will definitely give John a call."
4.5,5,"I will never trust anyone besides John at busted knuckle with anything I own. He's an honest mechanic that gets the job done right the first time. He's worked on everything of mine. Boat, motor home, work truck, cars, trucks, bikes. He is the man to know in this town. Thank you busted knuckle for always being there to save the day!"
4.5,5,"I needed help with a pre-purchase car inspection and fast, while John wasn't able to help me in time for my needs - he gave me some good advice and a reco that worked for me.  Thanks for being helpful!"
4.5,5,"So I walk out this morning to start my truck and NOTHING!!! Now I just bought a new batter,y so I know it's not that!! Doesn't matter, I'm going nowhere! 
Being a Yelper I do my research with my fellow peeps and this guy John from Busted Knuckles (love the name right) comes up with nothing but 5 Stars!! I love 5 Star Places!!
I call him at 7am on a Sat, he's knocking at my door at 8!! Checks under the hood, finds the problem, gives me a fair quote, fixes the problem....done!!! 
Great Guy, Great Service, Great Price....5 STARS!!!!!!

Use This Guy....HE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!"
4.5,5,"we needed help right away as we had no power in our RV.  Called John and he told us when someone could be out to our site.  Shane pulled up right on time.  He was very courteous and professional.  He quickly found out what the problem was, the power source where we were parked.  He even helped my husband explain the problem to the site manager.
We really appreciated his honesty and he truly cared.
When we are visiting out daughter, if we need help these are the guys we will call on!!
I highly recommend using this service!"
4.5,5,"These guys did me a good job , Tyler , came back after the original repair of my fuel pump to look at a check engine light problem related to an evap leak . I would recommend these guys , their service was reliable , and they were on time ."
4.5,5,"Omg I love these guys! They are extremely friendly, knowledgeable and fast. I called them Tuesday to get pricing to fix my car and I accepted the offer but they had to order the part which came in today(Thursday). I got the phone call at 8:15am that they were at my job ready to fix my car. It only took them 45 minutes and they even fixed something the AAA tow guy messed up when he towed my car but I still spent less then another mechanic tried charging me just for the one issue. I'd definitely recommend them to everyone!!!! I really love that they came to me so I didn't have to try juggling my work hours to make it to a shop! Thanks guys for being so awesome!!!"
4.5,5,"If your looking at this call them!

I am a car nazi and I build/ restore my own cars. But thanks to fixing the last issues I messed my shoulder up pretty good so when it came time to change the motor mounts two weeks later the second I laid a wrench on the car my shoulder said hell no!!!!

So looking through Yelp for local places near buy that do quality work I stumbled upon busted knuckles. And I will admit I though Mobil mechanic I think not. But after calling around for prices when people hear Cadillac the price goes up, and nothing burns my ass more than over paying for something I can fix myself.

They quoted me a very fair price so I went with it and he said how about tomorrow. Ding ding! They show up 20 min early and one guy is already under the car while the other is talking to me about what I want done. The work was done right and it was done in literally half the time I could of done it at full capacity. So the next time I want to be lazy and not mess with something I will 100% call again and recommend them. And if you search them on Clark co. Web site it is a registered business so it's not a clown showing up at your door!"
4.5,5,"Called John this morning and he had Tyler come out to meet me at my house.  Chevy C10 had been sitting and Tyler got it running for me! Wasn't a simple and quick fix, but he got it fixed and was super sweet and professional! Do recommend and will call again if I need any car fixed. And yes you pay for a mobile mechanic to come to your house if your car won't drive to shop... so yes you have to pay a fee to get them here and then hourly like an other car mechanic place! Well worth it!"
4.5,5,"Busted Knuckles Mobile Mechanics (John) is the best.  No B.S., comes to you, always on time, gives you a price, stays to it.  I had John drop all three axles on my Weekend Warrior to replace the bushings and grease bolts along with repacking all my bearings and adjust my brakes. He did it in 5 hours and did a great job.  I'd highly recommend him anytime."
4.5,5,"I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a shot. I've either paid too much or had cheap parts that would last a couple of days you know how that goes.  John was on time, he was actually early for our appointment. He showed me what was wrong, then let me actually see the price of the item unlike other ""Wizard of OZ"" behind the curtain mechanics. You will get the price straight up no hidden bull.  I was able to ask him any questions I had and he answered with much respect and knowledge.  One thing he told me was or I'm putting this in general is he treats everyone with honesty because that is how you get loyal customers in the long run. My car is up and running and I've got John's number for future repairs. Thanks for the power steering repair.. Toyota Celica 93"
4.5,5,"Well, it started with a fuel pump that went out on my son's Mustang and John saved the day!!! I was so impressed with his knowledge and hard work that he has become my #1 go to guy for repairs.   My vehicles are getting older, but I'm not ready to trade them in yet, so his services are beyond valuable.

Since the mustang repair, he has not only worked on my father's Equinox, but my boat trailer and my F250.  His customer service skills are impeccable and his mechanical skills are superior.  It's hard to find someone in the Las Vegas with this kind of commitment and I would recommend him in a heart beat.

Keep up the great work Busted Knuckle -- glad you're in the Las Vegas valley."
4.5,5,"On thursday my car died.  I was unable to find anyone who could help.  Out of desperation i called Busted Knuckle.  After speaking with John, he gave me a cheaper solution.  I am a senior on very limited income.  His advice saved me over $200.  If your looking for honest mechanics, these are the guys.  I will be calling them first when my aging car needs help, much like the aging owner. Thank you, John."
4.5,5,"Busted Knuckle was literally the angel I needed! My husband and I were on vacation trying to drive to Arizona when, while trying to get to our park, bucked our trailer right off our hitch just off of Boulder Highway at 10 on a Saturday night. We were able to get the trailer rehitched and limp it to our park but our vacation was looking bleak. We called Busted Knuckle at midnight and said they would come out first thing the next morning. They were there early and assessed our issues quick and were able to fix us up even quicker. No need to delay in Vegas to wait for a couple of non-essential parts they said (which probably lost them money - seriously who is that awesome) and we were on our way with the essentials repaired. I seriously can never thank them enough, They saved our vacation!"
4.5,5,"Mother-in-law's RV caught on Fire by another merchant located in Henderson (see my reviews).  He came out and helped her out by even calling the other mechanic who chose to provide no information about what casued the fire and proceed to swear over and over at him.  He was very patient and within a short time was able to get my mother-in-law back on the road.  Unforutnatley it cost her a lot more but i felt he did not take advantage of her just did the work necessary at a fair price.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND and hope they treat you like they treated us."
4.5,5,John was referred by Advanced Auto Electric and arrived within 20 min. Diagnosed within 30 min and found the required parts locally. Would definitely use again if I am in the Las Vegas area.
4.5,5,"Ok. So it was a total misunderstanding at first. John came thru and really took care of my truck. He went above and beyond. Seriously. He fixed my starter, thermostat, water pump and nade sure it was working better than when i bought my truck. He really made me a believer in his services. I would recommend him to any one i know. Dont do anything without calling him first. Hes a stand up guy and makes sure you are statified. Well worth the money and time. He has a shop opening soon and i will be promoting for him seriously. Thanks John. Appreciate everything. 10 stars."
4.5,4,"We had John come out for a couple different pre-purchase vehicle inspections..

Super flexible, super dependable, super thorough, super reasonable! He saved us potentially a bunch of money/headaches with the first prospect, which helped lead us to the SUV we eventually chose to buy.. 

If you need someone you can count on to come check out a car you're thinking about buying, we'd highly recommend Busted Knuckle Mobile Mechanic!!"
4.5,5,Busted knuckle makes it way too easy to get your car repaired and up and going quickly. I had taken my car into the normal place superior tire Goodyear on E flamingo for a whining noise that was coming out of the engine area. They took two hours to look at it and finally figured that it was my transmission pump and torque converter that was making the noise. It just didn't seem right though because when you pulled the dipstick the noise stopped as if it was a vacuum leak. After that I took it to seven palms across the street which specializes in European cars and they told me it was valves. Still didn't seem right to me so I ordered PCV valve and add John install it.  He replaced it and the wine is gone  and car runs back to new. It would of cost me thousands and still wouldn't fix my problems if I would've took the advice of the shops around here. Thanks John.  He will be the first one that I call from now on in the Vegas area.
4.5,5,"We were passing through Las Vegas on our way home after purchasing a new 5th wheel. After arriving at our campground and trying to unhitch I had two problems. First the jaws on hitch would not release. No matter what I did they were stuck, second I had a cotter pin shear on the pinbox. After a stressful trip this almost sent me over the edge. I was originally going to go through my good Sam roadside but after that failed I found Busted Knuckle on yelp. So glad I did!!! Amazing amazing amazing. Best decision of the entire trip. Responded quickly on a Sunday!!! Fixed both my issues with ease. I can't say enough about how awesome the service was. You will not be disappointed. Trust these guys. They won't let you down. Thanks again."
4.5,4,"I had trouble shot the problem with my vehicle and knew it was going to be a major time consuming fix ,so I called these guys on a sunday morning. They showed up when they said they would ,and the guys name was Tyler. I told him the fuel pump was bad ,and he agreed. I asked him for a total price to replace the pump ,and after he made a phone call he quoted $700 total. His total labor time was 3.5 hours ,and it was a difficult job because he had to removed the fuel tank. Just for interest I priced  a new fuel pump online for $106 . $700 total was a little high , but considering it was a Sunday , they were on time ,and did a good job I wont complain. I would use them again"
4.5,5,"This guy was AMAZING! I called at 7am in desperate need of an alternator swap. Within 30 minutes he was here at my work swapping it out for me. I couldn't believe how quickly he came to help me and was very personable. I had already purchased the part and in less than an hour he not only got it swapped but noticed another problem with the fuse box and was able to fix it on the spot for me for no additional cost. I am SOOOO grateful for him, I didn't know what I was going to do. THANKS SOOOO MUCH!"
4.5,5,"EXCELLENT CHOICE!!! If you are looking for an honest guy that is knowledgeable, reliable, and likable, look no further! I had a new alternator and battery put in my car, brought it home, and it wouldn't start the next day! Called John yesterday, Wednesday, to set the appt for today at 2pm when I get home from work. He calls me at 11 to confirm, and calls back at 1:54pm asking if I was home yet! Guy was already in my complex looking for my car. Well I pull up, and he's parked next to me. To abridge, he walked me through every step he was taking in his diagnosis, and within about 5 minutes knew exactly what the problem was and started to replace a little part to fix it. The car is running perfectly, and he spent another 10 or so minutes after fixing it just looking around under the hood to make sure everything else looked OK. John will get all my work from now on!!! I am elated to have my car back up and running, and to have found a fair guy I can trust. Thanks, man!"
4.5,5,"Vacation Savers!  Busted Knuckle came to the rescue when AAA could not help us out, even though we have AAA Premier RV coverage.  Tyler immediately answered his phone at 6.20am and arrived in 25 minutes...just like he said he would!  That was amazing!   Frankly, words can't accurately describe the phenomenal service he provided us when we were in a bind.  

A little backstory...our vacation started off with a tire blowout on our RV about 30 minutes after leaving the house at 4am. AAA was supposed to have someone for us by 6.15am but they called at 6.10am saying they've been unable to get anyone who has the equipment to assist us with an RV. I immediately started looking on Yelp for services and came across Busted Knuckle, which I'm so thankful I did. AAA called me back after we were back on the road saying they were still having issues locating anyone...huh, maybe they should get to know Busted Knuckle!

Thank you Tyler for immediately responding, taking care of us and getting us back on the road for our vacation in less than an hour!!!  You are my go to for Mobile RV Service going forward!"
4.5,1,"Never return phone calls ... even when they say they will.  Horrible customer service.


I am editing my review now because if I could give less than 1 star at this point I would.  Since I've stated my opinion, which is what you're allowed to do on Yelp (yep I'm a business owner too), I've been harassed by people who have read my review.  I've been called a liar, a whore, a loser, and more disgraceful names.  Any business that associates with people who harass others for stating an opinion on the customer service they received is just as horrible as they are.  I'm being harassed because I stated I had bad customer service and never received a call back.  I was in an emergency situation with my RV and I called several places.  I left a message for this company and never received a call back.  I am disappointed with the service.  Now I'm disappointed in a whole lot more.  Instead of trying to fix it, I'm called names!  What kind of business is this and what type of people do you deal with?  My money is best spent with people who respect others"
4.5,5,"I was out of state and in a desperate situation after normal business hours. Looked on Yelp for an open mechanic shop to no avail. Found Busted Knuckles and called. Tyler came out pretty quickly to replace my alternator in a parking lot. He was personable, professional, knowledgeable, and the job was done in a very timely manner. When done he checked to make sure everything was running as it should. Their rates are really reasonable compared to all the other mobile mechanics I called and even cheaper than a couple big repair chains I was able to get ahold of (but wouldn't do the repair because of the time). Definitely calling them again if ever I'm in the area and need a repair or maintenance."
4.5,5,"I was heading out, but then my car wouldn't start. I found Busted Knuckle through Yelp. I thought the 5-star rating was too good to be true... until I read the reviews. I called John and he showed up at my house within the time frame he specified. He's very friendly and he knows what he's doing.  

Highly recommend to everyone. No, these reviews aren't sponsored. They are definitely deserved."
4.5,5,"This is an awesome business. John, was knowledgeable, professional, friendly and arrived when he said he would. If we could give him more than 5 stars we would. Mahalo John for your service and for getting our A/C replaced."
4.5,5,"John the owner of Busted Knuckle, came to my rescue within 30 minutes. He diagnosed why my slide would not retract into my motorhome. He immediately disassembled the gears and we determined I needed a new slide motor. John ordered one had it shipped overnight and I was able to leave the next day. Unbelievable to find a great mechanic that took a personal interest in my problem. I highly recommend, John."
4.5,5,"Owner is an upstanding, honest, fair and timely individual! He showed up when he said he would, did what he said he could do, and charged what he said it would cost. No surprises or add ons.  We were in Vegas and just happen to break down as we arrived.  He came to our KOA spot and replaced the radiator right there!"
4.5,2,"Call him and he told me he was out of town and that wasnt a problem, i was i told that he would call me nack on Monday, but ended up calling him and he was suppose to come the next and he never called or came. Im sure hes a good guy but he never came thru for me"
4.5,5,Trustworthy and reliable. Very grateful to of found John on Yelp from all the great reviews and they were not wrong. There is a reason why he only has happy costumers and 5  star ratings. On time. Knows his stuff. Prices are extremely reasonable.  Thank you john!
4.5,5,"These guys are great.
I had an electrical problem with my coach that I could not figure out on my own. I was able to get a same-day appointment with them and they had the problem resolved in under an hour.  Fast, Courteous and knowlaedgble."
4.5,5,"UPDATE at end of this review! Be sure to read the whole review!

We had been having problems with an AC unit on our 2011 Tiffin Phaeton. The circuit breaker kept popping with the high heat. We had another service company come that thought it was the circuit breaker overheating and replaced the circuit breaker. However, the problem continued.

We saw the ad for Busted Knuckle in the Oasis Las Vegas RV Park brochure and they were recommended by the guy that made the first service call.

John came by the next morning and looked at the circuit breakers and then went on the roof to check out the unit. Said the whole unit needed to be replaced. But, they could not find a unit as they are on National Back-order.

Came by today to collect for his service call. Cost $225 to have him come out and look for 30 minutes or less.

My fault for not asking what it would cost to just look at it. I was shocked at the service call price. Especially when they did nothing for me.

The guy that came out and spent an hour and replaced 2 circuit breakers only charged $135.00 including the breakers.

Be an informed consumer!


UPDATE!!!!!!

2 weeks after the fact and having the AC unit checked out here in Phoenix I had occasion to contact John. We discussed the situation and the diagnosis on the unit. John was very professional and suggested an accommodation and reduction to my bill.

This says a lot about the way he does business! Thanks John!!! With this type of response, I would highly recommend travelers in your area give you a try."
4.5,5,John came out to replace my alternator and power steering pump. In and out 90 minutes. Works perfectly. Thanks again!
4.5,5,Had a busted leaf spring on my 5th wheel called John up and they were there right away to fix it.  Also fixed some wiring issues I was having.  Great work. Great rates.  Couldn't ask for better service.
4.5,5,"Words Can Not Capture the Relief and Satisfaction Im feeling from using Mobile Mechanics today! Outstanding Service!!! Amazing Service!!! 
I was out to breakfast and holiday shopping  my girls friends across town from where I live, when it was time to leave ... I realized I wasn't going ANYWHERE!! My column shifter when I went to put it in reverse, didn't catch or click into gear, there was just play and the shifter went up and down with ease and not catching any gears!  
Being a woman I wanted to cry... Thinking of what it would cost me to fix this major problem on a 2007 Cadillac Escalade. I sat and remembered a Special Young Man who has given me his business card for his Mobile Mechanic Business that I carried in my glove box!! I called and Within 3 rings my call was answered by the owner John And he commuted to be on site within 45 min. He arrived right on time with a professional service truck and had the issue resolved in less than 10 minutes!!! I was so happy... I'm still very happy! Busted Knuckle and John made My Day, My Month, My Year!!! 
Best Money I've ever spent and let me just say I paid Busted Knuckle less for the Mobile Service and immediate fix than it would of cost me to tow my SUV home across town!!  I'll suggest John and Busted Knuckle to Everyone I know!!!"
4.5,5,"I live in the Los Angeles area and found a car I was interested in in the Vegas area. I needed to have the car inspected before making the trip to see it myself.

John was very friendly and polite on the phone. He agreed to inspect the car the very next day. He drove the car as it should be driven(V8 manual) and he gave me the information I needed to know but didn't want to hear.

If I find any other too good to be true cars in Vegas, I know who to call."
4.5,5,"We were travelling through Las Vegas and had a breakdown, and Busted Knuckle was unbelievably helpful with free advice and fantastic knowledge over the phone.  In the end they were too booked up to work on it, but their help ended up getting us back on the road.

Really professional, really knowledgeable."
4.5,5,Absolutely the best experience I have ever had with any mechanic mobile or not. Tyler showed up very quickly and was very professional and got the job done right. Their prices are very reasonable and they get the job done in a timely manner which shows they are not trying to steal your money. I would recommend busted knuckle to anyone who needs mechanic work done. I will for sure be using them fo any future issues I have!
4.5,5,"John did excellent, timely work at a fair price.  I would highly recommend him for all your RV repairs.

I'll suggest John and Busted Knuckle to Everyone I know!!!"
4.5,3,"John had a great personality and had no problem explaining things to me that I knew nothing about when it comes to cars.

I had meet me at a dealership to do a pre-purchase inspection on a car that I was interested in buying. I sent him a text message the first time, but he never responded so I ended up calling him later that night to set the appointment up for the following day.

He showed up, and immediately got to work, he checked over everything. He checked the doors, trunk, tires, looked under the hood, turned the engine on, etc, etc.

He said everything checked out and that it was mechanically sound.

I asked him specifically if the brakes were still good to which he said that they were fine. However, after purchasing the car and driving it around for about two weeks, I started hearing a horrible grinding noise coming from the front tires. I took the car to a tire and oil shop and they told me that I needed new front brakes. I'm not sure how John missed that one but okay.

When looking under the hood, John took the oil cap off and commented about how the oil was changed. But like the brakes, I ended up having to get the oil changed aswell since the car is a Toyota and it began flashing the ""maintenance required"" light on the dashboard and according to the manual, that means the oil needs to be changed.

I also noticed that when I took the car home the day that I purchased it, the low tire pressure light was on in the dashboard, John didn't mention anything to me about it. but since he turned the engine on, I thought he would've caught it.

I tried filling the tire up, but it turns out that it had a leak in it which the tire shop I took it to repaired along with changing the oil and putting on new front brakes.

I was fully expecting John t test drive the car, but he told the dealer that he doesn't do that. But according to an earlier review on here from January of this year, he test drove a car for a customer so I'm not sure what that's all about. I think test driving is quite important, because issues may come up while driving a car that wouldn't necessarily come up while it's just sitting parked in one spot idling.

I didn't see John use a scan tool at all, not sure if he had one or if he just doesn't think it's necessary. i would think that using one on a used car should be a minimum requirement since they can tell you alot about a car's computer.

The price was kind of steep at $150, but I can understand since he travels to you and if you live way on the other side of town, that's not a short trip.

So all and all, he was a very nice guy with a great personality.. But I don't know if I'd use him again or recommend him to anyone else."
4.5,5,"H really knows his stuff, and shows up when he says he will.  He was very knowledgeable about the transmission issue I about explained a lot about my car that I never knew before.

I would highly recommend Busted Knuckle for family & friends, and I will be using their services again in the future."
4.5,5,Call these guys!  Don't waste your time looking for other mobile mechanics.  They show up on time - do great work - and at a reasonable price.

I called and Within 3 rings my call was answered by the owner John And he commuted to be on site within 45 min. He arrived right on time with a professional service truck and had the issue resolved in less than 10 minutes!!! I was so happy... I'm still very happy! Busted Knuckle and John made My Day, My Month, My Year!!! 
Best Money I've ever spent and let me just say I paid Busted Knuckle less for the Mobile Service and immediate fix than it would of cost me to tow my SUV home across town!!  I'll suggest John and Busted Knuckle to Everyone I know!!!"
4.5,5,"I have a BMW 530i and a radiator hose came off draining all the coolant.  I had my car towed to my house.  I called John the next day and he was very punctual.  After working about 15 mins we tried to find the part and we had to order it online so that we could get it for a reasonable price.  Unfortunately, the part was out of stock.  The next morning he said he could pick it up from the BMW dealership and be at my house soon.  He showed up in about 20 min. with the part and didn't waste anytime on getting started.  He had the car running like it was a brand new car within 20 mins.  He is very professional and shows up when he says he is.  He is very reasonable when he quotes you and is not unfair by any means.  I highly recommend him and will continue to use him from now on."
4.5,5,"While I didn't need this service in person, the gentlemen on the phone (who I think is John) did a fantastic job! He was extremely helpful and so honest about the cost of the damage we had to our RV. If I have any other mechanical issues, I'll be sure to use them."
4.5,5,"Auto problem? Busted RV engine? Don't waste your time calling anyone else. Seriously. Call John at Busted Knuckle and let him get you back on the road. FAST.

John and his assistant are extremely quick, capable, and good at what they do. Period.

If you're bored, here's our story:
We were traveling across country in a 35ft RV when the starter went out. We were up in Beaver, Utah at the time and none of the local shops had the correct starter....so with the help of the local mechanic, we managed to get the RV motor running and we drove to Las Vegas, figuring it was a big town and someone there would likely have the right parts. Since we were on the road, it was a semi-emergency in that we couldn't wait for 'an appointment next Tuesday' type setup.... We needed a new starter and we needed to get back on the road to San Diego, ASAP.

After calling around, we found an RV repair guy who couldn't do the work, but recommended someone who could. After setting up a repair first thing in the morning with the recommended mechanic, we started looking at reviews and this particular mechanic had numerous reviews warning us away from him. I mean a LOT of scary reviews. We decided that the best chance to get ripped off was to have a mechanic 'hold us hostage' because we were out-of-towners and had very few options. We decided to find another mechanic, so we searched YELP and found John @ Busted Knuckle, with his many 5-star reviews. We called him @ 8:30pm and he said he could come out the next morning. Fantastic!

He gave us an ETA of 'hopefully by 10am', which we were fine with. He showed up early, and was under the RV calling out needed tool sizes to his assistant almost before his truck had even come to  complete stop! I'm not kidding...he was under my RV and removing the starter within 2 minutes of arriving. (keep in mind that the diagnosis of a bad starter was made and verified by a mechanic in Beaver, Ut., so John already knew exactly what he needed to do).

John removed the starter, showed us and explained that our starter was different from a regular GM starter (because it's an RV), and that he had to go to the other side of town to get one....that might take an hour. He was back in less than an hour, and again was under the RV installing the new starter within minutes of arriving. We tested the new starter and everything has been working great.

Timeline: about 10 minutes to remove the starter, and about 10 minutes to install the new one, plus the time to go get it from the other side of town. John and his assistant are nice guys, but they are seriously dudes on a mission, and they don't waste their (or YOUR) time messing around; your stuff is broke, they're there to fix it. End. Of. Story. 

The price was about what I expected; a little higher than an appointment from my local garage for similar work, but John is a mobile mechanic, and they charge a little more for the convenience of them coming to you. Plus, ours was an 'emergency' and he squeezed us in. 

In short, we called him @ 8:30pm, and by 11:15am the next morning, we were repaired and on our way. Plus, per our agreement, John didn't utter one ""Oh sh!t"" or ""THAT'S not supposed to happen!"" or ""What the....?????"" or ""Ohhhhh THIS isn't good!!!""while he was under my rig....these comments from a mechanic always precede conversations like ""This is gonna take more time/cost you more!""

We couldn't be happier. You could be happy too....if you call Busted Knuckle."
4.5,5,"John and his partner are top notch mechanics. I would recommend anyone who wants the job done correctly, quickly and conveniently to call them."
4.5,5,"Busted Knuckle for the win  These guys are the best. Just as my vacation was getting started my car broke down right in front of my hotel. It would not start and it could not be jumped. I do not have roadside assistance and it was the start of the weekend so most shops had closed. I found Busted Knuckle on Yelp and called. They came out right away. The guys were super friendly and did not hesitate to do whatever necessary to fix my car. In about 20 min they had found and solved the issue and my vacation was back on track. If you are in a bind DO NOT hesitate to give these guys a call, they are well worth it."
4.5,5,"Having to call a mechanic out for something so stupid makes me feel like an idiot, but for once it wasn't my vehicle. It was my son's. He'd just purchased a used SUV from our roommate, and the truck would start off and on. We'd replaced the battery multiple times, guessing that was our issue, and if not, we figured it was the alternator.

John was awesome. Showed up early, made sure everything was working properly, figured out the problem (which was stupidly simple), and even gave a second vehicle a once over, just because we knew it'd been having issues too.

If you need a mobile mechanic that'll treat you right and fix it (no matter how big or small), call John over at Busted Knuckle. He'll straighten you out, and is a gentleman to boot."
4.5,5,"John is an absolute stand up guy, honest and reputable. If you're looking for mobile repair he should definitely be your first and last call."
4.5,5,"I just purchased a new trailer for my Polaris Side by Side. It is a custom trailer built specifically for side by sides. You can buy several accessories for these trailers however if you do this after you purchase them instead of ordering them with the accessories already built on the trailer, you actually have to fabricate them yourself. I purchased a set of ratchet straps that were custom for this trailer Afterwards, it is well known in this market that if you do not lock it welded strap it or guard it? It will be stolen by the time you come back after having your fun for the day. I reached out to Busted Knuckle, to help me Mount the straps to my trailer but in a way they would be secured and could not be stolen once leaving my trailer alone. Not only are these guy's mobile, but once they saw what I had and what I was trying to do, they offered several Solutions and scenarios to mount the straps. Not only did they do clean work it's custom work and good work. Their price was very reasonable for what I had done. It was just about what I anticipated on paying, was not overpriced, was not cheap, but fair, remember, you get what you pay for. I will pay for Quality every time. I highly suggest using these guys. Granted I have only used them once and it was a welding job it was not a repair of any kind, but with upfront pricing fairness and quality... that is something you don't see often enough anymore. I will definitely consider them in the future."
4.5,5,I had a great experience.  My car died. He was able to fix the issue and get me back on the road. Great pricing for servicing a vehicle. He was very personable and friendly.
4.5,5,"My car did start, would not jump start, and a new battery did nothing. I needed my car to get to work so I found all these great reviews so I decided to give it a chance. I was a bit skeptical about all the 5 star reviews, but they are legit. I called John past 11 pm on a Sunday night, not only did he answer, but we set up an appointment for the next day. His diagnosis of what was wrong was correct and he replaced the starter in less than hour. John is extremely personable and knowledgeable. He does the work right in front of you so you can be sure nothing shady is going on. MY P.O.S. of a car needs a lot of TLC and while it hurts to have work done on it, I feel completely confident that John will fix the problem, in a timely fashion, for a reasonable price. 100% recommended."
4.5,5,Tyler and John answered my call in the middle of the night came out and fixed my motor home so I could pack up and drive to another state the guys were both very knowledgeable and very professional I would recommend them 10/10 times thanks busted knuckle
4.5,5,We had a great experience with this business and will use them again! Being new RV people we have many questions and all were answered! So nice to deal with people who are actually concerned about you and the results!
4.5,5,"My ""toy car"", a 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII needed a jump start.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I called John.  I happened to catch him as he was finishing another job not far from me and he showed up when he said he would.  Quick, courteous and even offered a discount for veterans.  

Highly recommended!"
4.5,5,"What can I say?! They saved us. First of all, the gentleman on the phone was so knowledgeable and polite. After calling a couple of other Mobile RV mechanics, I was becoming discouraged.
Not only did he say he'd be out that same morning, he really tried to work with our schedule at the Oasis RV Park. Two guys arrived and did an awesome repair job, completely finished in and hour. Boom"
4.5,5,I was out at Dumont Dunes with my brand new CanAm X3 and needed help setting up my suspension properly. I reluctantly went over to their camp because I hate to bug people when they are out to have a good time. I asked if someone could help me out and they immediately jacked my car up and went to work. Holy crap!!  What a difference!!  I tried to give them $100 for their time and they told me to get out of here and have a good time. What great stand up guys!!  I would highly recommend giving these guys your business!!  Thanks again guys!! See you soon!!
4.5,5,"I just  had my starter replaced by Busted Knuckle today. Unlike the mobile mechanic company I originally called (who rescheduled my appointment at the last minute for the following day-and then never showed up or responded to my inquiries), Busted Knuckle arrived promtly and fixed my car. I felt the price was fair-especially for coming to my home, and I will definitely use their services in the future!"
4.5,5,"I highly recommend John with Busted Knuckle. As some of you may know it is sometimes difficult, as a woman especially, to get good and honest auto repairs. My 2008 Ford with 95,000 miles began to have some problems and my check oil and check engine light were on. I was worried about driving it due to the sound it was making and wanted to find a mobile mechanic that could come to my home and diagnose the problem and hopefully fix it. I'm also on a tight budget so I was hoping to find an honest mechanic with reasonable prices. I called another highly rated shop called AJ's, but despite what Google says, they do not do mobile work. But they very nicely referred me to John at Busted Knuckle. I immediately looked them up on Yelp and saw their excellent reviews. I called and made an appointment. He came out and in about 2hrs he had diagnosed and fixed the problem and had my car sounding great again. He was very thorough. He showed me where the problem was and was also able to show me on his laptop how my engine works so he could fully explain my problem. He was never condescending and had all parts needed to make the repairs. He also removed the corrosion from my battery as a courtesy. He was very honest and had excellent advice based on my financial limitations. If ever you need repairs he should definitely be your first call."
4.5,5,Busted Knuckle saves the day!!!! I was stranded in my Lamborghini on the side of the 15 and John was there within 20 min to fix it. Amazing company! He's been there the last 2 times for my G wagon also. They do it all!
4.5,3,Let it be known...they charge $150 per hour and $100 just to show up. So...as soon as you meet...you're at $250. That's it.
4.5,3,"Do not hesitate for one moment in calling Busted Knuckle. From the point of first contact, everything was professional and competent. Communication was excellent. John took our call as we were coming in to Vegas with what I thought was a bad power inverter. John showed up right on time, diagnosed our problem as a blown fuse between the battery bank and the inverter. A quick trip to the parts store and we were good to go. You can tell the competence of a technician in a quick few moments. John IS competent in spades. Price was more than fair. Don't look anywhere else.


Second experience with them, not as good as first. Had a water leak in our RV. Tyler came out instead of John. Tyler arrived on time, but I have not seen a dirtier person. Jeans were filthy, hands were almost black. I had to ask him to wash his hands prior to starting work inside our coach. He did fix issue, and was a nice guy, but when you are a company that often works on RV's that cost over $100K, clean up first or have cover-alls."
4.5,5,"Highly Recommend Busted Knuckle. I was in a dilemma with my fuel pump. Jack was quick to respond, diagnosis and offer a solution. He was kind, honest and got my job done earlier than I expected. I will go back to this company and request Jack's assistance in the future. Thank you guys for doing awesome work!!!"
2.5,3,"We came here for a San Diego State University / Arizona State University football game. The overall campground is decent, nothing special. The restrooms and showers were fantastic, although the pool is somewhat small. The site is very reasonably priced. Only had two issues, the cable doesn't work without a box (And they wouldn't give us one as we were leaving on Sunday and their office is not open on Sunday), and the Wifi did not work. The light rail was extremely convenient to get around town."
2.5,3,"Simple, clean and primitive site. The wi-fi didn't work so we used our hot spot. We met some very nice people and enjoyed our stay. It was quiet and the location isn't bad. Metro across the street and the Tempe Marketplace is down the road. Granted there is a dingy mobile home park next door, but we didn't have any issues. Uber and food delivery available too! Nice place to park for Spring Training and Mill Ave is 10 mins away."
2.5,1,"I cannot fathom how anyone could rate this beyond two stars. The service is incredibly rude and unprofessional. Pitbulls with bowel obstructions are more pleasant. Not quiet, near liquor stores with questionable miscreants milling about. Avoid at all costs!!!"
2.5,3,"Nice staff. We received a lot of packages at the office during our stay of 3 weeks.  Not a lot of trees or anything but concrete.  Spaces pretty darn close together.  Ok pool area with small hot tub.  Public bathrooms and showers clean. Ditto the laundry room.  Wifi was really hit or miss...and that's with a booster!  Pretty basic place...the Motel 6 of RV Parks.  No real complaints, but absolutely to rave about either. Ho--hum!"
2.5,2,"We have stayed at Apache Palms RV Park for many years, but I will not stay there any more. It's an okay park, but today as we were ready to leave, we got a call from the front office telling us that we have stayed past the checkout time!  Five minutes after 11:00!  It's not like there were lines of RVs waiting to get in. In fact, there were several vacant spaces. It just left a bad taste in my mouth. The front office is the problem."
2.5,4,Great park for spring training. Short walk to the MetroRail and other public transportation. Employees were fast and friendly. Park was clean and quiet. Next time I come to the Valley of the Sun I will stay here again.
2.5,2,"I had called and spoken to the maintenance supervisor about us moving out of our apartment and living in our 2014 travel trailer full time.  I was aware that the website stated 1 pet, but he had said that the manager would have to approve it.  He ALSO said he didn't see it as being a problem.  I went into the facility and her rude ass was sitting on the chair eating her lunch.  He got up out of the other chair and got behind the desk.  I walked in, stated I had spoken to Mike and that we had two dogs that needed a manager's approval. Up until this point we had liked the park, it seemed quiet which we REQUIRE and she looked at us (obviously because we were under 55) and said ""No, we don't take two dogs on a month to month basis.  WHAT? You would allow two dogs other times but not on a MTM basis? I also happened to see how many sites were OPEN and BEGGING for business but she continued to eat her lunch and chomp cream corn at me.  FIRST OF ALL, if a customer comes in YOU PUT YOUR LUNCH DOWN and deal with that customer.  Secondly, I saw NO ONE out and about the RV park which was a HUGE turn on for me because I am looking to move out of the ghetto and into somewhere MUCH quieter.  I don't see what the issue is.  I pick up after them, I take them to the vet every year for their annual visit, they have their shots, they're quiet and no bother to anyone.  Honestly I think she brushed us off because we were in our 40's and she thought we were party animals, and quite the contrary.  We would have paid our rent on time if not early, done auto draft, stayed to ourselves and just enjoyed living in peace and quiet.  I went across the street and rented a site from the Tempe Travel Trailer Villa to Dianne a MUCH more friendlier person and willing to accommodate.  Her park needed some work anyway."
2.5,5,"This is our fifth year staying at Apache Palms RV park. My brother and I come in March for Baseball spring training. This park is perfect for us as it is in a good location to get to the ballparks on the southeast side of the Phoenix area. It is across the street from the light rail so getting around on mass transit is very easy. Angie and Mike are always friendly and accommodating. The park is clean and safe. This is not one of those mega-parks that have bocci ball and shuffle board, but if you are looking for a park with basic services, Apache Palms is for you. We continue to return every year because it is clean, safe, well located (for us) and the staff is friendly."
2.5,1,My Husband and I wanted to park our RV here for a few months. I can't really put my finger on it but the employee basically told us that we could stay for maybe a week. I felt like she just didn't want us to stay. We found another RV park in the area and I drive by all the time now. I can see that they aren't full as she claimed they would be. It's a shame she is doing this.....I'm sure the owners would appreciate the business.
2.5,4,"This seems like a 60's-ish campground, which was probably rural until Tempe grew up around it.  Still, it was nicely set up, and the staff was quite friendly.  The facilities were clean and well-maintained.  If we needed to stay near Phoenix again, we'd happily return to this park."
2.5,4,"I liked it, well for the most part.  It was quiet,clean,friendly.  My only problem (and it's not their fault). Tempe seems to be turning into a getto. Lots of run down buildings, however the good news is the police station is directly across the street.  I didn't have any problems nor did I hear of any.  The price was great for our stay, the staff helped me park my 5th and went out of their way to be kind and helpful.  The sites were wide and deep.  I would absolutely stay there next year when we go to Tempe for spring training.  I just hope the economy picks up and the town turns itself around."
2.5,1,"Lived at Apache Palms for many years. WIFI DOESN'T WORK consistently and is often inoperable. Angie and Barb (manager and owner, respectively) are very rude and unhelpful. You cannot get a site for $236 in the summer. Spaces are very tight and there are few spaces with any shade. Electricity is outrageously expensive as the park tacks on an extra fee to each monthly bill. Lots of dishonesty among the staff, so be wary. Although not the park's fault, this area of Tempe has become ghetto. Park is surrounded by low-income housing, a noisy auto repair shop, an adult book store, a no-tell motel, and a vacant lot used by locals to sleep and sell meth. The homeless and grifters also walk into the park after the staff have left and hustle to make money selling worthless stuff. There is no security at the park, and no staff after 5, so you're on your own, folks. Walked in on a guy sleeping in the laundry room recently. Others sleep in remote corners of the park. The police are frequent visitors to the park especially at night when young couples get into fights. The police station is NOT directly across the street as advertised. A student condo complex is directly across the street, but the police certainly know their way to the park! Read the other ads. I am by no means alone in my opinion about the area and staff,  so please understand I am not trying to harm the staff or the owners. I just believe they can do a much better job treating their customers like... well... customers. Apache Palms has benefitted by the closing of many local rv parks who have sold out to condo developers. Since inheriting the overflow of business, the owner of Apache Palms can be very selective about who can -- and who cannot -- stay in her parking lot. There isn't much peace and quiet or even privacy to be had at The Palms anymore. I suggest you stay at a place that is eager to earn your money. Good luck and happiness in your travels. Be safe!"
2.5,1,"This park is not a real good place to stay. Even if you are looking for just a place to park and hook up, it is in a lousy neighborhood, Seems like a ghetto, abandoned buildings, empty lots and just basically nasty.  It was clean enough, but no real amenities to speak of.  The pool is a joke and the WIFI is nonexistent.   There reservation policy is also inflexible.  We had to leave to travel home due to family issues, and they would not reduce our weekly rate, we had to pay for the full week to stay 3 nites.  In actual fact, we only stayed 2 nites and headed out, because the place was in such a sketchy neighborhood.  couldn't take a walk.  It is also small so unable to do anything within the park.  Not at all what we expected for Arizona.  For the same money we found other places with full amenities, activities and meals.  Absolutely no comparison.  Staying here is a rip-off."
2.5,1,"Travelers beware!  Very clean park, however appearance is very deceiving.  Customer service VERY poor, rude staff that does not listen!  Rent includes wifi that is nonexistent, Cox Cable TV that has very poor reception.  When brought to the attention of the staff was told it was not their concern.  After 4 months of living in the park with our 2 golden retrievers, the owner informs us that they do not allow big dogs.  The staff was told at the time we moved in that we would have our doggy daughters with us and nothing was ever said that they did not accept big dogs, in fact the lady in the office told me that she loved goldens!  Unfortunately I didn't read the Yelp reviews before choosing this park, will be far more careful in the future."
2.5,2,"Small, clean in a don't touch anything kind of way. 
Tempe is a Mecca of RV'ing. There are truly dozens of parks in the area with thousands of places to park my rig. I can't think of any reason why I or anyone else would chose to park in one of theirs. 
The woman checking me was the most unfriendly and unwelcoming person I have met in a long time.  My presence and the need to check me in was clearly an imposition   I guess she found me personally offensive as well since she found it necessary to get up, walk into the room around the corner and return wiping her hands with a sanitary wipe  after having to handle my credit card and proceeded to wipe down the pen I used to sign the credit slip.  Right in front of me!  Made me laugh. 
I was charged additionally for each of my 2 dogs. Something I have only encountered at hotels for unstable cleaning work. 
The wifi stinks, useless really. 
The surrounding area is not the best part of town. While on a short run I encountered lots of homeless and those nearly there. Some rough looking young people. 
I was there 1 night. Won't be back."
2.5,1,This place is a scary looking dump of an RV park that is located in the slums of Tempe.  Their website is deceiving!!!
2.5,1,"Add me to the crowd. This place sucks. Some nice snowbirds, but otherwise just a dirt pad to park the RV. No one expects great WiFi at an RV park, but I was parked right under the antenna and was not able to log on once in 7 days. OWNERS: Save yourself some money and quit pissing people off by getting rid of it! It doesn't freaking work! Tempe is a pretty upscale part of Phoenix Metro area, but if there is a ghetto this place is in the center of it."
2.5,4,"We stayed here around 10-12 years ago and had to leave in the middle of the night because the CO2 levels we're so high you couldn't breath. We just recently went back for the holidays and didn't realize it was the same park. The new management has done a remarkable job refurbishing the sites. They are immaculate, well maintained and relatively larger than before. It isn't a large park, but they have used the existing space very efficiently. The new pool and hot tub were a welcome respite from our long drive from CA. The park is in the center of town which made it exceptionally convenient getting around to the various family activities during the holiday. The laundry room was clean and had a plethora of local brochures for perusal. The newly renovated toilet/shower areas were immaculate and good size. They were unisex and single use with a locking door. Very private. This is a very popular park-make your reservations early. We tried to tack on a night but they were already full."
2.5,3,"Apache Palms is a dated but well maintained park.  The park roads are just a tiny bit narrow on the curves, but large 45' motorhomes come and go without any significant problems.   I had to back up to make one of the tight curves in my 40' MH, but fortunately I had disconnected while my wife went in to register, and we were able to make the turn into the park towing a 17' dingy by taking both lanes of the busy frontage road.   ALL the roads are one-way, but some of big rigs HAVE to exit using the entrance, and it can make things ""interesting"" because motorhomes cannot backup when towing.  The park has a pull-in area for registering at the office. It is marked for two rigs, but we pretty much filled both spots.

   They have all the normal things like a pool, laundry room, & showers, but all are small to tiny.  There is no dog run, grass, or club house.   The trees are too small to qualify as shade trees.  The spaces are gravel with narrow cement pads.  The public shower and laundry room is housed in a very small building that that's about the size of a good tool shed.

    The wifi was the most frustrating  I've used at any park, which is one of the reasons for an ""average"" rating.  Repeated frustration from waiting for pages to load, having the signal disappear, and restarting the computer was the daily cycle for three weeks.   The wifi worked only enough to keep you trying.   If a working internet is important then find another park , use up your own data, or be prepared to go to Hell for cussing.  

     Have you ever read one of those reviews that starts out, ""The staff was really great ...."" ?  Well, this isn't one of them.  The problem seemed to come from one person who set the tone for some of the others, but one of the men was very nice and helpful.  I want to emphasis that the one staff member NEVER said one thing that was wrong; she was just an expert at unintentionally raising your blood pressure by tone, body language, and abruptness.   My wife and I discussed  why she became such an issue for us, and we believe it was because we felt like if you tried to reason with her it could easily escalate into a verbal altercation.   But as some reviewers said, you don't visit RV parks to be friends with the staff, but that doesn't mean they can't leave a burr under your saddle.  
    
    Here are some examples of those burrs.   After making our one-week reservation to have a chair lift put installed, an extreme heat wave set in that tried for the record of the most consecutive days of a 110 or higher.   I phoned to see if we could get an early check-in to beat the extreme heat.  As anyone who drives in extreme weather knows, this is a safety issue.  (People died from being caught in the heat while we were there.)   We had to travel across dessert mountains with one slow climb lasting for about ten miles (or so it seemed).  Extreme heat is not good for radiator hoses, tires, etc., and break downs in a tin-box MH would mean hours on the side of the road under conditions not good for most living things, ... especially old people.  She was unconcerned.  Check-in was 11 AM.  Period.  Rules are rules.  It would have been nice for her to have softened the ""NO!"" with an explanation, such as, ""We'd be happy to accommodate you if we can, but all the spaces are booked and they might not leave much before check in ....""  If that was in fact the case, but I've never seen every space leave minutes before check-out time.  Even IF every space was rented, I'd bet a few of them would leave before sunup to beat the extreme heat.  When we pulled in a few minutes after 11, we looked over the available spaces.  Unfortunately she had already assigned us a space.   After seeing the assigned space I went back into the office to ask for a better space for parking and exiting with our large MH, I was told it couldn't be switched.  The space I wanted remained empty for two days.  Asking for the space number on our paperwork to be changed appeared to be too much of a hardship.  The poor customer relations didn't stop there.  The internet problem caused the system to be down for protracted periods, when I phoned to check I was told I could use the cable inside the office, but was twice directed to an outside table when I appeared at the office.   (Remember the extreme heat.)   I used a lot of my jet-pack data while at this park.  A refresher course in customer relations 101 might be in order.  

   Would I stay here again?  Only if my wife agrees to call the office to see it they've solved their internet problem.  It gets old real fast to keep getting ""No network found"" in the middle of a major metropolitan area."
2.5,3,We stopped here for two nights.  The spaces are tight but the folks were nice.  They said they had no larger spaces yet no one was in those spaces the entire time we were there?
2.5,4,"Although we felt the advertising/website for Apache Palms was a bit misleading, we did find it to be a very clean, well managed, well manicured and even somewhat spacious (not crammed in on top of each other) RV camp.  The cement pads were great - you step out of your trailer onto cement instead of dirt... that's nice.   The pool was just right in terms of temperature - it might need a little more chlorine, but the Jacuzzi was perfect.   A great place to stay in the middle of a busy Tempe, and very close to ASU and the metro.  We would stay there again for sure."
2.5,2,"2.5 Stars
This is my second visit.The staff is friendly and the park is clean and fine if you just want to have a place to park your rig. No shade. Amenities are minimal. Small pool, laundry, showers which I have never used. WiFi is advertised but doesn't work. It's so bad that you shouldn't even waste your time trying to connect it. I always end up on my phone!
I come for Spring Training and I wish I knew of another RV Park near Diablo Stadium to try."
2.5,4,"This place is really great for the price. Plus there is a light rail station right across the street so you can go anywhere without a car. Be nice to the staff no matter how they act towards you and they will bend over backwards for you. Don't let the surrounding community deter you as it is very ""ghetto"" with lots of abandon buildings and nice new buildings mixed in.  With the Tempe police station across the street and a decent fence on the back & sides this place is safe. I haven't seen anything stolen or vandalized and talked to long time residents and they haven't either.   

Wifi is non existent. They have 4 routers and non of them ever work. So don't plan on using it. Free Cox cable tv is horrible and pixelated, but I have never had luck with cable company tv. 

They desperately need shade over at least part of the pool in the summer. Afternoon sun is the devil. 

Still a great price, location, and well maintained."
2.5,1,"Woman who answers the phone having a bad life. Asked me what my service animal was for...then said it didn't matter because they do not charge for small dogs...then why ask!!!???!!! I ask her why she asked and she refuses my reservation! Stay away from these people!
Yes, much better places to stay in the Valley.
The lost art of customer service - highlighted at this location.
Stay at your own risk!"
2.5,1,"Due to the nature of my husband's work we travel last minute, so we had to call this place late Saturday night to try and find a monthly spot. We were told to pull into any open spot and we would deal with paying on monday. We pulled in late saturday night, and then realized we were in a weekly spot, so we called again and confirmed we were in a weekly spot. To be proactive, we moved our trailer on sunday to an open monthly spot to avoid moving late monday night after my husband got off work and to ensure the weekly spots were open to the weekly guests. When i went to pay monday morning the owner (also the person my husband talked to on sat and sun on the phone) was very rude to me stating we parked in a spot that is already taken. I apologized and explained we were told to pull into any available spot, which is what we did. She threw her hands in the air, sighed loudly, and told me i had to unplug and move immediately. I explained i couldnt as my husband was at work with our truck. She was very rude and upset as if this was my fault. If the business is concerned about others taking spots that are reserved they should let us know that rather than tell us to pull in anywhere available. She claimed there was an occupied sign on that spot, but there most definitely was not.  We saw occupied signs on other spots, and avoided those, but there was not one on the spot we took. She then told me no parks take monthly reservations over weekends when the office is closed. Well I know this is not the case at other parks as I have never had this problem and we travel full time. Also, if their park is not equipped to allow monthly guests come in on weekends, she should have told us that when we first called on Saturday night and refused us service. But instead of telling her this, I stayed friendly, and continued to tell her about our dog to set up another ""available"" spot for the month. She said large dogs are no longer welcome. I have a large dog, and had called this park 4 months prior and were told our dog was allowed. We should have asked again upon this check in, but assumed their rules were the same as a few months prior. I apologized again and she said rudely - ""I can change the rules whenever I want"" - and I told her I understood. At this point I should have stopped being so friendly considering how she was treating me based on her incompetence of assigning spots to new comers. This situation could have been handled nicely on monday morning, such as ""sorry that spot is taken, i should have assigned you a spot, but please move as soon as you can."" Or she could have told my husband on the phone saturday ""we dont take monthly reservations on weekends, please find another park"" But appearantly treating people with respect is too difficult. I would like to give 2 stars because the park is clean, and apparently she was super friendly to my husband when he went to pay for our 2 days there. But since she was so rude to me, for no reason and despite my unnecessary apologies, 1 star it is."
3.5,5,"I had taken a part from muy hot water heater to several other R.V. Places and they had no idea how to help me cause my trailer is thirty years old. Brought the part in, they took one look, showed me the problem and I went home and fixed the issue.
 No Charge!!!!!"
3.5,5,"We are extremely impressed with the timelines, quality work, and service of RV Renovators.  We take our 03 Monaco to these fine folks for virtually any type of work from cosmetic to complex equipment repair and installation!  Monty and his team of excellent associates including Jim, Bob, Curtis, and many others take excellent care of our coach and us. The administrative assistant Danielle is super nice and always ready to help us. And get this...RV Renovators clean the coach inside and outside before returning it to you!  We highly recommend RV Renovators for all of your RV service needs."
3.5,5,They were the closest authorized aqua hot service center when I needed one. They did such an outstanding job and everyone there was just great to talk to that they are now my 1st choice in rv repairs.
3.5,5,"I dropped off my motorhome for some final warranty repair work that was messed up at the factory repair center. While it was there, I decided to have a Winegard Trav'ler installed. The work was first class! Some of the poor work performed by the factory repair center was fixed and looked very professional. In addition, they had to fabricate a special mount due to the slope of my roof. The mount is solid and should last forever, and the dish works great. I recommend these guys wholeheartedly. It's a 2 hours drive from my house, but the quality of work is worth the trip.

I can't speak to the length of time to repair the RV since I told them there was no rush. It's the busy time of year, but the repair tech took the time to review everything with me before I took the vehicle."
3.5,5,"Great Job! RV Renovators repaired collision damage on my motorhome and the results are like-new! Not like-new as in almost like new, but it's just like it was when it was new. The before/after pictures are amazing. They completed other miscellaneous repairs and all were completed with the same great results. I highly recommend RV Renovators."
3.5,5,"We came in because a windshield replacement done in California cracked coming across to Arizona a week later. I talked to them two days ago. This business fitted us in on our tight schedule, got the new glass delivered, installed it yesterday and will have us back on the road today! Their technicians really seem to know their jobs - everyone is friendly and works efficiently. They found a broken clip on the wiper unit and replaced both to make sure they were both good. They were able to hook us up overnight even though their lot was very full. We will certainly come back here if we need other work done on our coach!"
3.5,2,"Took our motorhome there for some updating. Staff were friendly enough but didn't seem very organized. Their prices were really high for the work we were interested in. We had them repair the refrigerator. They had our RV for 2 months. Just kept saying they would get to it. Disappointed when we picked it up and there was a half dollar size very dark stain on our dash. There was trash spread around on the furniture. They did have the stained dash repaired, at their expense... after trying to convince us they didn't do it. I guess the worst thing that happened while the RV was in their possession was the rear license plate (with the sticker) was stolen. Unfortunately, the registration and insurance info was also taken from the pocket in the driver's seat. Figured that out when the police called and stated that our abandoned motorhome was found at the river. Whom ever took the plate and papers put it on their motorhome. Anyways, we won't be taking our rig back there."
3.5,5,These folks are excellent!  I love the variety of options and the customer service is A+++!!  I will always use them when I am in Mesa or anywhere nearby!!
3.5,5,"I won't bring my RV anywhere else. Lets not fool ourselves. Like anywhere else they are in it to make money. However, they are honest and reasonable about the practice. That's all I want. Be honest. Be reasonable."
3.5,1,"Might be a good business. Sadly never found out.   If you have an Airstream, they don't come off exactly on fire about working with them. AS are a higher end and requires passion and skill this growing business might have at some point as they mature."
3.5,1,"I am leaving a 1 star for now, will update if they correct the problems.  I have been coming here for years, with my Dolphin and with my Monaco.  In past I have worked with Levi, the owner's son and have had fantastic body work done.  Mechanical work has also been good.  Even when it wasn't, they would make it right.  They have a new service manager now and things are slipping.  Had body work done on my Monaco and they did not put my 3 M Mask back on.  I brought this to the attention of the Service Clerk at the time named Kelly.  She said they would make it right.  Kelly is no longer there and I brought it to Jim's attention, the new Service Manager, and he hemmed and hawed a bit but said they would fix it.  Still not fixed.  I brought my Monaco in for major hail damage.  Insurance check was 18,000.00.  I signed it in good faith that all had been done when I picked it up.  They told me to write down anything wrong on my trip that I was leaving on.  Right off the bat I noticed that about 90% of what was on the estimate and what they were paid for was not completed.  Starting with steam cleaning the interior.  Then front and rear end caps were to be completely refinished along with the removal and reinstallation of antennas, air horns, etc.  Then I realized that my roof was replaced with fiberglass and not metal as it was originally and now my coach torques when on its jacks.  I have brought the coach back with the list from my insurance company so that they can make this right.  Have to meet with owners next week.  I sincerely hope they restore my faith in them!  They are close and convenient for me.  Will update next week after meeting and again after coach is picked up.  Fingers crossed!!"
3.5,1,These guys attempted to repair a wall issue in my RV which is now falling apart again.  Their idea of buffing an RV is a joke!  I had them work on our water heater and they said there was a nest in it!  It would have been impossible to have a nest in there since It was used all the time and there was NO opening for a bird.  I opened up the water heater at home and it was half full of calcium.  They didn't do anything with the water heater.  I will never go back!
3.5,1,I hate leaving a company a bad review but I took my 25' camp trailer to them to have a window and a heater replaced.  They called and told me I had 2 broken windows and asked if I wanted both fixed.  Funny thing is I only had 1 broken window and clearly showed them that when we did the initial inspection.  After arguing with management who were no help my hands were tied and I paid them full price for both windows.  Upon picking up the trailer the gentleman who towed it back to my car told me he saw broken glass on the ground where the trailer was parked and told management the window was broken on premises.  Needless to say no one ever took blame for the window so I had to take it in the shorts.  Liars and cheats who take advantage of people.  They will never have my business again and I hope you look elsewhere when getting your RV serviced!
3.5,5,"We bought an old motor home a little over a year ago that had sat for almost 20 years. We met with Mark Germaine about numerous concerns last November. Each concern was written down and addressed with their technician. He then called us to discuss ways to repair a black tank leak that would save us money, repair a generator fuel line, repaired dash air, checked out roof air to determine leak, replaced dome sky light, cleaned and re-sealed entire roof.  

Very good communication. Each phone call was followed up with an email to verify additional work. We would  wait for an estimate on something and then we would add something else to check that was within our budget. 

We needed suspension checked out so they took it to Straight Line Suspension for an estimate. (By the way, the suspension work was just completed : bushings, alignment, steering linkage, replace air Springs with coil springs, tie rods and bell cranks). RV Renovators recommended Straight Line and we trusted them enough to trust Straight Line. 

Our motor home is now back with Mark because we've decided to go  for a new roof AC. WE are so pleased to have found this company. Their lot is always full. They are always busy. We didn't need to hook up since we live in the valley but they do have electrical hook ups for those people traveling who need repair work. 
Forget about Camping World (you're lucky to even get them to answer or return a phone call --then you're told to wait three weeks before they can even look at it). 
Great customer service. Even those answering phones are friendly and helpful. Fast response to emails. Those that gave bad reviews ---it's like they're talking about the wrong company. 
(Proud ""new"" owners of a 1997 Airstream Cutter 34' Motorhome)

It would be tacky to take off one
 star because of dirty carpet--when we brought in our motor home in November, we just had our carpets cleaned that morning. They were still wet and we told Mark. We assumed they would put paper down like auto service people do. The day we picked it up it was raining and they're were dirty, oily footprints from door to drivers seat. I've worked at them with vinegar and baking soda but still have spots in dog house. My recommendation is not to assume that because our coach is old, that we don't keep it clean  so invest in a large roll of news print and lay it down. This time I covered that area up with small area rugs."
3.5,5,"We know how we don't like to go to a bunch of repair shops for all the things that can go wrong with a Motorhome or RV. RV Renovators will be happy to tackle that list of items with a vengeance and get it all done under one roof. Technicians like Jerry Bob and Curtis and Jesse who know motor homes inside and out can find out the cause of a problem and fix it in no time fix it and then insure it doesn't happen again by rigorously testing it

No matter how busy Monte, Levi, Kelly, Nancy and JIm always find a spot for me at the lot  and get my coach hooked up when i have to live in it (or not for that matter). I've driven hundreds of miles to have these guys work on my motorhome because its worth it to get the job done quickly . Aside from engine work RV Renovators can do just about anything. 

And when its done, the coach is always washed and sparkling to go on the next trip. 
Thanks guys for your support"
3.5,5,"t's rare to read positive reviews for RV dealers or repair yards, but here's one I'm happy to report. Last month our Allegro coach was struck by a red-light runner here in Phoenix. When Camping World was slow to respond to my call for a tow, I had the coach delivered to RV Renovators in Mesa for the $12,000 of repair work required to get us back on the road. We were met there by the owner, Monte Germaine, who quickly promised the kind of first-class customer service that in reality seldom seems to materialize. Well, I was wrong about this guy. Every promise he made to us from the first day was met and often surpassed. More to the point, the repairs were completed on time and to very high standards. Speaking for myself, I hope to encounter others in this business like Mr. Germaine as our RV experiences continue. He and his employees are real deal when it comes to customer satisfaction."
3.5,5,"We just can't say enough about RV Renovators. They are very professional and honest. They have a professional for everything, cabinets, floors, plumbing, electrical, what ever you need done. They were above our expectations on everything we had done. Any time we are in the area, this would be our only choice. This is the first time in 6 years that we were very pleased when we left an RV service and repair. All employees are happy and work so well together."
3.5,1,"What about the little guy?

I have a 27ft travel trailer that needs a window repair. The woman I spoke to at RV Renovators was not helpful at all! I needed a ballpark figure for the repair and without taking the trailer to them, likely leaving it there for who knows how long due to work schedules, she couldn't say even close to the cost. Not even a range of $100 over or under...could be very pricey and then finding a better deal would be in our best interest for all the hassle this company needs customers to go through first! It bugs me in this day and age when companies don't see the bigger picture.
We plan to have a lot of other work done to the trailer to ""customize"" it when we can afford it next month and now I pray I can find a different place to take our trailer to that is more accommodating to customers.
By the way, a hint for those in customer service, don't be grumpy on the phone, don't say ""NO"" as much as you can avoid it, offer HELP/ASSISTANCE. After-all its what the CUSTOMER is looking for!"
3.5,1,"slow.. when they tell you a time frame, double it. had our Rv for 6 weeks, promised 3 for repairs. insurance estimate and approval was completed in 3 days. insurance
ance company was not the delay. They did not order the needed parts for over 3 weeks. some items never ordered.  At pick up we pointed out items not competed, in order to finally  get our rig back we accepted some trim they had laying around that was ""as close as we can get"" ..  
now finding items not finished properly. sheet metal not screwed on ... etc.
if you need work done in Mesa area.. find someone else. we would drive over 500 Miles to find a repair shop before letting  them touch our rig again."
3.5,5,"We decided to renovate our 2007 Newmar instead of buying a new one. From the beginning of our journey we knew that RV Renovators was going to do an outstanding job. From custom cabinets to new counter tops, sinks, TV,  convection oven, induction stove new dinette area and shades. The workmenship and detail is just jaw dropping.We couldn't be happier. We will be back in January because I want more things up graded. Thanks to an outstanding team. Jim, Curtis and Monty. Thank you so much!"
3.5,5,"RV Renovators is 1st class in service and repair.  We are on a 2.5 month Motor Home tour of the US. We contacted a minimum of 5 RV repair places around Mesa AZ and no one was willing to assist us. Our RV Mirror was struck by another RV a week prior and it was unsafe to drive. 

RV Renovators were more than happy to do their best and get us on the road as quickly as possible.  They also asked if there was anything else we needed fixed. My husband shared that our front end shook  and the  refrigerator seemed to have a propane leak. Without hesitation they made phone calls and with their connections set us up for the next morning to have experts look at the front end. In the meantime, they worked on the refrigerator and resolved that issue. While working on the refrigerator the full slide did not retract.  They also then had to reprogram the slide for us. Their speedy service had us back on the road in 3.5 business days. That included ship time in order to get the mirror. Please note that they had a full lot to service and their folks were busy working on several RVS not just ours. I'm confident that all customers there were also  pleased with the service. Only wish we had RV Renovators near us in MI. Highly recommend them and felt we were in great competent hands. As a bonus they even washed our RV."
3.5,5,"We are extremely impressed with the timelines, quality work, and service of RV Renovators.  We take our 03 Monaco to these fine folks for virtually any type of work from cosmetic to complex equipment repair and installation!  Monty and his team of excellent associates including Jim, Bob, Curtis, and many others take excellent care of our coach and us. The two administrative assistants Danielle and Nancy, are super nice and always ready to help us. And get this...RV Renovators clean the coach inside and outside before returning it to you!  We highly recommend RV Renovators for all of your RV service needs."
3.5,4,Great place to stay. Office staff and managers are super helpful. We would highly recommend staying there. Whenever you need the maintenance people they are there to help you put your RV in and fix whatever problems you have
3.5,5,"Would recommend to any and all future Vegas bound RV'ers! ! The lovely ladies in the office were the MOST helpful park office employees from Tennessee to Nevada! Dog friendly, clean, safe, close to public transportation, pool, laundry, showers, etc. Oh...and affordable!"
3.5,3,"Stayed there for a year only because of the cheap rates. The area is nasty, but never had problems in the park. In the summer time, we got alot of sewer smell in our spot (pretty nasty) eventually they tried to remedy it, but right before we left last week, the sewer smell came back as the day heated up. We ended up leaving 4 days earlier than planned. We did not get a refund for those days although they had already rented out the spot!! Can you say double dipping."
3.5,5,I stayed here 2 months ago. I was very pleased with the place. The price for the week was really affordable. The ladies at the front office were very pleasant to talk with. Very home feeling atmosphere. Will be returning here soon.
3.5,1,They just don't  want us in the camping because we don't have a new camper. Chame to be treated this way.
3.5,5,"Nice and cheap park. very friendly staff.
Restrooms are not really pretty (ok. they sucks), but we have our own in our RV, so who cares ;)
A small nice pool with cool (thanks god) water to cool down in the June heat.
PArk is huge with different spots. shaded places, good wifi and a rec hall with book exchange.
can 100% recommend for RVers looking for a park on a budget."
3.5,5,Wonderful RV park with over 55 year history in Las Vegas. Nice facilities and great customer service by management staff.  Would recommend!
3.5,1,"This review is about my experience with PAM, the front desk person at KING'S ROW RV PARK. I did not stay at this RV park, so I cannot speak to the amenities, but I can tell you that just by taking a visual assessment - it certainly looks run down and neglected for sure. But, this was okay for me, because I was just looking to put my RV in their storage lot for a month.

Now, I am new to RVing and I pray that this is not a prelude of what's to come because I cannot take the stress and aggravation of dealing with morons. Nor do I have the time and energy to micromanage someone as inept as PAM. As it was, I called not once, but twice, in order to be clear about what was required in order for me to place my RV in their storage lot. (My RV was recently purchased in another state and does not yet have license plates, but I DO have all the DMV paperwork showing that the title, registration, insurance, and license plates have indeed been paid for.) PAM told me that if all my papers were in order and that my rig passed their visual inspection (no broken windows, leaks, etc.) that it should be fine.  I made sure that there was not a problem with taking my rig in and out of storage during the month and PAM said as long as it was during office hours that it would not be an issue. I told PAM that I would be coming in that afternoon so PAM was expecting me....however, after driving the 30 miles to their location, turns out that the owner needed to be the one to visually inspect my rig and that an employee needed to guide me in to the tight space that was available in their storage lot. That would not have been a problem, but PAM, not able to think 2 steps ahead, failed to make sure that the owner knew I was coming and that an employee, be at least a phone call away, in order to assist me with the parking.

So, I basically drove all the way over there and was not able to put my RV in storage due to PAM's incompetence. And what was PAM's suggestion? That I should come back the next day - sorry PAM, but I work and I can't just come on back tomorrow. Why do you think I was doing this on a Sunday? Not to mention, that coming back after work on a Monday would have put me in the middle of the worst traffic of the day and during the hottest time of the day. And then, some ignorant (because he had no idea of what had proceeded my arrival) customer that was in the office while I was there, told PAM if he had a business that he would hire her - well good luck with that sir and I have a great name for your new venture, you should call it ""Dumb and Dumber""!! 

Anyway, PAM keeps telling me that she's bending over backwards for me, and doesn't seem to be able to understand why I am so upset.  Did PAM really think she was helping me by not having coordinated my arrival with the persons necessary to do the visual inspection and help with parking? Oh wait, was it by wasting my precious time and costly gas? Or, was it by having me need to come back a second time?  

Listen, do yourself a favor - if you call this place and PAM answers the phone, either hang up or ask to speak to anyone else!  And, if you have the poor misfortune of arriving when PAM is the only one manning the office, then I strongly suggest saving the aggravation and going anywhere else - and you can thank me later!

The good news is that you have a multitude of other choices in the surrounding area, so there is really no need to even bother with this place to begin with. Lord knows, I wish I hadn't.

2.5,1,"Stayed here while working at Sky Harbor, just not worth the money. No privacy to close, horrible internet, cable is as basic as you can get. And dogs barking 24/7 right behind park. And line mariachi music until 10 pm in evenings. Better places for your money."
2.5,1,Rude staff. Small tight spaces. Really bad neighborhood. Homeless people stay in parts of the park after office hours. They come in off the light rail to spend the night. Not a safe place. Staff very unhelpful. There are better places to stay. Left after four loud nights. Police visited the park often.
2.5,1,Horrible management from Pam. She is extremely rude and snappy at customers. She needs to learn the law and customer service skills. Sad it took someone to get bit by a dog after 6 months of me complaining for it to be taken away. Although I still think the dog is there since this person gets favoritism. This park would get 5 stars if Pam wasn't the property manager.
2.5,4,Great location at the end of the line of the light rail.  Acrss the street from the Mekong plaza with great restaurants and a huge Asian supermarket.  Safeway and Wahlgreens are within walking distance.  Great wifi reception.
2.5,4,"This park has improved since I first came here 7 months ago. If your space is close to Main Street it can be quite noisy, but considering the rate, convenient location and basic amenities it is probably one of the best values in the greater metro area. The park grounds manager, Lee, is especially diligent and always willing to help. If you can spend the 30 bucks more a month to get a space in the north lot is it well worth it - the spaces are larger and it is much more quiet."
2.5,5,"My parents stay here and are very happy! It's clean, quiet and pet friendly. Pam is a great manager and Lee keeps it spotless. Would highly recommend it for RV'ers."
2.5,1,"At night, this park locks the bathrooms, from 9 pm to 8 am.  That means they are closed almost half of the 24-hour cycle.  

Why?  I asked and the manager said it was because people make a mess in the bathroom at night.  Huh?

This makes no sense at all to me.  There is already a combo lock on the bathroom to keep out strangers.  Did anyone ever make a mess in the daytime?  Why not close them for good?

Also, there is no soap in the bathrooms.  No soap?  Not like the dispenser is empty, it's not even provided.  The garbage pail is chained down but no soap is provided.

This is a low-end park in what seems like a marginal neighborhood run by someone who doesn't understand customer service.  If she ever suffers an inconvenience, I think her instinct is to punish everyone.  

I will never, ever go back here."
2.5,5,I had an amazing time here. Lots of space. Very clean bathrooms. Great pool and hot tub. Very friendly people. And most importantly I felt very safe as a single female traveling alone.
2.5,2,"I lived at Green Acres for almost a year. It does have pluses- close to many things, secure, pool, excellent maintenance guy named Lee, free basic cable, laundry room, etc unfortunately the minuses win. The spaces are very close and some spaces arent really spaces. The free wifi doesnt work worth a crap.The bathroom smells moldy and musty due to lack of exhaust fans. The manager is a backstabbing witch. Trust the other reviews. I had to move suddenly half way through the month and not only did she keep my deposit but she rented my space that i had paid for up until 10/17. I went back 2 hours after i moved to pick up a plant and an RV was already there. She'll act nice at first but dont trust her, shes crazy. I say avoid that place like the plague."
2.5,5,"My wife and i lived in an RV for 12 years and at the Green Acres RV Park for four of those years. it is a very pleasant place, quiet and clean and the Manager Pam Clarity, and assistant manager Djuana were always on top of things. one of the things I noticed was when a package of special mail would arrive it would be brought right to our door.
Restrooms were always very clean and the laundry area and swimming pool were as well.
Price was reasonable and the guests were screened as they should be.
Would I stay there again? ABSOLUTELY !.
Donna and Bernie"
2.5,1,"The manager of the park, Pam is the most miserable mormon nut that you can imagine. She hates her job and has no business running this park. She discrimates against people and writes up stupid violations for everything. Her new nutcase decision to lock up the bathrooms 9-9 is utterly insane. People need to poop in a bag and leave it at the locked bathroom. Pam has spies everywhere expecially a blond cougar that is equally insane. Watch out young rv guys she will try to take you down. I warn people to stay away from this maximum security RV park. And remember cameras are everywhere."
2.5,2,"Tiny RV park new Tempe, with a crotchety old owner who's actually really nice. RV parks are always defined by their price and their ""amenities"". The price is fair, but the ""amenities"" are nearly non-existant. Yes there's a bathroom, but it was the worst bathroom and shower that I've experienced traveling the country. Water just got everywhere, and there was no way to hang a towel or anything. Plus there was no plug in you needed to shave or dry your hair or anything. It's also not exactly where google maps says that it's located, so it's a bit difficult to find."
5,5,"Phoenix Mobile Welding did a fantastic job with the gate for my Grandmother's home. We were in Phoenix on vacation and wanted to get as many ""fix-ups"" done as possible as my Grandmother is frail and needs a bit of help. They were so accommodating and came in the same week. Left us feeling so much better that we could get it all done while we were visiting. Thanks Phoenix Mobile Welding saved us some worry!"
5,5,Excellent! Responsive to my first inquiry. Gave a me a good estimate and stuck to the price on install. Scheduled quickly. Showed up on time. Did craftman-like work. Nice guy. Good choice.
5,5,These guys are pros! I was nervous about having someone come out to do  the welding I needed to have done. I was nervous because the welding was being done on my rv. Anyway the guy that came out (doug) did a great job. I  highly recommend Phoenix mobile welding.
5,5,"The weld on the backyard gate's hinge had failed, causing it to fall to the ground. With three dogs needing containment, time was of the essence. 

The company recommended to me was going to have a tough time getting up to the Anthem area for a couple of weeks so I was forced to roll the dice. Boy, do I love it when luck is on my side! I left a message on a Friday and heard back in less than an hour. They came out bright and early the next morning -- Saturday morning! -- and fixed the gate. They also took a look at some pool fence posts we were concerned about and decided one of them needed to be addressed. They came back the following day -- Sunday!! -- and fixed the fence post. It ended up being a bigger job than they had predicted so it ate up even more of their weekend.

To find someone who 1) calls you back, 2) within 24 hours, 3) provides quick service, 4) provides quality work, and 5) was very pleasant to deal with... that's pretty rare. Not that I want to need a mobile welder in the near future, but at least I know a great one if I do!"
4.5,5,"John is an honest, upfront guy. He doesn't try to sell you something you don't need. He is friendly and runs a good business."
4.5,5,"Bought our first RV from them. Have to say I was extremely pleased with the way we were treated the whole way through. My wife and I never felt pressured, and they even told us several times they don't want to sell us something we don't want. They have a really good multi-step process that allows you plenty of time to inspect, and they will fix ANY little nit pick thing you can come up with. Not only did they fix our list, but went above and beyond when they found a couple of other things that we missed. 
I WILL buy from them again someday. 5-star experience all the way."
4.5,5,"Around Thanksgiving last year, I found a used Class A online at this place.   It was a special type of unit with a wheelchair lift.   Living in California, and with some trepidation, we corresponded by email and phone with John.   I was impressed that John gave me the straight information on condition of the coach - full disclosure and complete professionalism.  Living out of state, and trusted what I heard from John and this company - I took the big lunge, agreed on a price, made deposit and flew to Arizona (nervously) to pick it up.   What I found when I got there was EXACTLY as promised.  The unit was cleaned impeccably, John walked me and my son around, showing patience and support at all time.   The experience exceeded all my expectations - again, professionalism, and fair price.  

So, this is my first Yelp review, and the reason I am writing is to give feedback 6 months or so AFTER the deal!   John has been 100% available and assisted me by phone - but the pleasant surprise is when I took the unit in for servicing here at home (today).   The service provider said he seldom sees such a well maintained unit - for the year.  Reminded me what an excellent coach I purchased.

John and Superstition - thanks again for the honesty, and complete transparency in the deal you gave my wife and I.  Truly a great experience I will never forget.  (Jim)."
4.5,1,"For the safety of yourself  and other drivers on the road...please make sure you pay to put brand new tires on any RV you purchase before you drive it off this lot.  We learned the hard way and it cost us an addtional $5,000.00 to replace 2 rear tires and repair damages to our new coach. Fortunately no one was hurt when the right rear tire exploded while we were driving thru the desert.  Safety first...buy new tires!!"
4.5,5,We have not yet purchased from this location as they did not have the RV we were looking for. However we found them to be very nice and I liked the info provided on each unit. The info provided the age and condition of the tires. I have found many dealers unwilling to provide this info. We also found the prices to be reasonable. We found a RV we liked at a dealer down the street but it was $15K overpriced. I wished these folks would have had this unit in stock.
4.5,5,"Bought a 29' Lexington RV from john almost 2 years ago and had a great buying experience so when we decided it needed some TLC work I called him.
He quoted me a great price... one that made it worth driving 1.5 hours (one way) to drop it off. 
I picked it up a week later and everything was done correctly and it looks great. He has a lot of knowledge and is a hands on owner.

If it should ever need anymore work I will definitely contact John."
4.5,4,"I swore I'd never buy another vehicle from a dealer in fact in the past I've hired an auto  broker just so I wouldn't have to get my blood pressure up. 
I also taught customer satisfaction for over ten years to a national auto repair chain so I know good customer service when I see it. I only went there because he was one of the few that had the model we wanted to see inside.
John is extremely knowledgeable and I got a good vibe so I put down a deposit and left him with a short list of items I would like to see fixed before we picked it up. 
When we arrived to pick it up he gave us a complete run down on how everything worked and some items had not been taken care of so they did them as we were completing the paper work. It was the smoothest purchase I've ever made. 
Now, having said that when we got home we found a few more items that they were supposed to of taken care of and hadn't but I know if I went back he would and they're not enough to give a negative feed back. We just didn't do a thorough enough inspection before we left."
2,5,"This is the best Thousand Trails  we have been in so far. We travel in a class a motorhome and the sites are level, electric is great. As for the noise????You are in Las Vegas,  there is noise 24/7 no matter where you go. If you want peace and quiet go to a rural campground.  This is convenient to everything.  We were here for 2 nights and WILL be back. We are full time RV'ers and very happy and impressed."
2,2,"Feels run down, pool & wifi not available, unkept restrooms such as no toilet paper available. We're not one for writing bad reviews but I'm afraid this will be our last visit there."
2,1,"We stayed here for 2 weeks and was miserable the whole stay. Park is dirty including bathrooms. The cleaning sheet was hanging in the bathroom and would be signed daily yet one time the bathrooms went 3 days without a cleaning. They smelled and was out of paper. People didn't clean up after their dogs so the grassy areas were a mess.
The most upsetting part of our stay was being crowded in a spot with a neighbor that had been staying as a fulltime space renter. He had trash all along his dumpy trailer, a car and truck. He would park his truck completely under the bedroom of our 5th wheel. We would be woke up all times of the night and smell his exhaust. He would have parties so we had to deal with the noise and 4 to 5 cars. My husband is handicapped yet we would have to park at the back office, because they were parking in our spot...Complaining did no good because security was a couple kids. They would ask him to move and this guy would ignore them. I worried about theft because this guy watched us come and go..we would have to keep driving back to the park to make sure everything was ok. I wrote to Thousand Trails General Manager to complain and didn't even get a response.  A waste of money, stay somewhere else.
Mike and Ramona"
2,1,"Yikes. Never again. 

 Since I have been a 30+ year member, I have had many, many great experiences at Thousand Trails parks and have always felt safe and welcomed by the staff and other members. We wanted the safe surroundings and convenience of having a kitchen so I chose to stay at the TT Las Vegas resort with my mother and cousin for a girls' weekend. 

I have no complaint about the staff at Thousand Trails. They were very polite and helpful getting us set up in our rental cabin. 

About the cabin. The beds were saggy and the fold out couch was so mushy we needed help to get out after sitting down. The full kitchen was stocked with the necessary dishes and the bathrooms were sort of clean, but again, dated and needed updating. The curtains in all the rooms were filthy.  We tried at first to laugh it off and being good sports, we didn't run away like we should have. Not up to other Thousand Trails' standards at all. 

After settling in, we started to notice screaming and fighting noises coming from outside.  Since we arrived after dark, we had no idea an apartment complex full of the lowest form of humanity was so close to us.  From 9:30 pm to 4:30 am we listened and watched in fear for our lives to fist fights -- we could actually see a fight and held our breath as a man was thrown against a balcony railing -- and drunks yelling and cursing literally all night long. Needless to say, my planned girls' outing to my private campground was not only a hair-raising experience, it was very embarrassing to me. We waited until sunrise and got out of there and rented a room at hotel on the strip - not easy at the last minute -- and tried to salvage the weekend. Luckily, I was with family and I think they still love me. 

Since I am a long time member of Thousand Trails, I requested a refund or wanted at least an apology but heard nothing back from them except that my email was sent to a corporate office. Good job, Thousand Trails."
2,3,"Here's Maddi again with a review...Well, given that this is my very first time camping, purchasing a trailer, and obtaining a Thousand trail membership, the experience was OK.  Why just ""ok"" well, we came into the park with our trailer really late that night, so we couldn't the see the spaces on where exactly to park, so we just parked and figured that in the morning, we would move the trailer.  Of course, in the morning there was a guy that walked up to us as we where trying to unhook/hook the trailer from our SUV, who didn't identify himself, all that he said was ""site"".  I later found out that his name was 'Alan' from a board I seen with workers names on it and he was a park ranger ( I guess).  He kept going on and on and on about how we weren't ""correctly"" in the parking spot.  Which we already knew, and we were going to move. As he walked away, I noticed a radio in his back pocket.  So, I though well, MAYBE he works for the park...? If ""Alan"" would've properly identified himself, and stopped all of his jaw-jacking, then MAYBE I would have given this park four stars.  I understand all of the rules and what not ok I get that, but there's a way to approach people and at least identify yourself if you are an employee.  No name badge was visible, he had on a navy polo shirt, black pants and a dark hat with no sign of the Thousand Trails logo.  Since I have a membership to Thousand Trails, I will have to return, but I will make sure that we park in the back and not towards that front by the ranger station.

--Maddi"
2,2,"There are a thousand better Thousand Trails RV parks than this one.   We stay in the Get-a-way and it was surprisingly not up to par.   The bathroom rug,  shook out into tub cause i just had a feeling,  and ""ugh!""  Super gross dirt,  hair,  who knows what!!!  No soap or other amenities in bathroom,  curtains tired looking and the park overall is jam packed.  Just so you know."
2,4,"Three of us stayed in the cabin which ended up being perfect.  Very clean and had all the essentials needed for a comfortable stay such as cookware, barbecue, utensils, bedding etc.  We would suggest to bring your own towels, although provided if you don't bring them.

Had a nice porch area to enjoy morning coffee etc.. Very nice accommodations."
2,3,Definitely feels like camping more than staying in a RV Resort in Las Vegas.  I recommend the Arizona Charlie's if you are not a member of TT and want a more expensive resort style.  If you want to mingle and walk your dog with other seniors this is the place to be.   But stay at Sam's Town or AZ Charlie's if you are looking for a more modern young touristy rv parking resort.  Staff is great here and always very helpful.  Men's bathrooms were clean.
2,1,"The restrooms resemble circa 1960 high school P.E. bathrooms and showers.  We were on the road two and a half weeks and by far this was the worst campground for amenities.  The Men's restroom had one urinal, one toilet and, as Josh B said, two showers with a single shared wood bench and vestibule.  The lids on the dumpster next to the restroom were flopped open and no one seemed concerned about the flies buzzing around the open containers."
2,2,"We did ok...the entire park is extremely cramped and tight, with many extended stay guests who park their vehicles in the road because they have no choice. We were lucky enough to have read the reviews before we got here, so we could refuse a space along the apartment side wall. The space we got was surrounded by full timers too but they were very nice and offered to move their cars so we could get in. There are picnic tables but since there is no room to open your awning without sitting on the neighbor's parked vehicle there is no point to them and most people have pushed them behind the That area is like an old trailer park lined with ""permanent resident"" RV's surrounded by trashy yard ornaments, toys, barbecues, and old vehicles covered with tarps. Somehow they get around the ""no full time living"" rule. I cannot imagine having to spend even one night in there crammed in between them.   And its not in the best part of town but it is convenient to everything. The pool is actually very nice, as are the staff. The pool hours are limited, closing at 6pm. The bathroom/laundry rooms are old but functional.  The shower situation may be acceptable to some, but not to me as the changing area is shared and I value my privacy. The biggest problem here is a very pervasive sewer stench, which seems to be unhealthy. My eyes have burned and been watery all day. Not sure if the sewer leak is the reason, though. 

All in all it was ok, but if we had not gotten the space we ended up with it would have been miserable."
2,2,"Pretty disappointed in this Las Vegas rv park. There were a multitude of little things wrong, that just made this park one I will avoid in the future. 
1.  The ""park-wide wifi system hasn't worked the whole time we've been here. 
2.There is a sewer smell emanating from various areas around the park. It is unusual to smell a little bit of sewer gasses now and again, but these are constant. 
3.  There are several junky sites throughout the park, as if people live here full time & don't keep them tidy. 
4.  Many of the sites are small and some (like ours), are darn near impossible to maneuver in to. 
5.  Along the outer perimeter sites, the road is only about 12 feet wide. With an RV, it's difficult to traverse, to say the least!
6.  The staff is not helpful, probably due to the fact that no one has a clue what us going on.
Thousand Trails usually does a good job in providing a nice camping experience. Not in Las Vegas."
2,2,"We went to this RV thousand trail park in Las Vegas at the end of July 2016. The weather was 110-113...hot. We are towing a 25' trailer, with slide outs. We were directed to a spot where there was not even enough room to open our awning all the way...though there were plenty of extra spots? There were permanent junky units all around us. We travel with a German shepherd ..the dog run was ok, a little shade and grass.  Unfortunately there were many aggressive dogs at the dog run.There is grass outside the dog run, all of it marked ""no dogs"". Between the hot pavement being too hot to walk on, only to arrive at the dog run and have aggressive dogs there, it was not a good trip. The pool was out of commission because of a storm that happened 6 months prior, they have not even begun to fix it. The bathrooms were small and old, but not too dirty. Maybe we will came again another time of year...when the pool is fixed...and we can have enough room to open our awning. MAYBE NOT."
2,2,"If you're just looking for a place to park for a night or two this place is OK. The laundry room works, and the neighbors are nice but it's nothing to write home about.  We are in town to visit our son and do some gambling, it fits our purpose. The only thing that's very upsetting is I paid $25 so that I would have the Internet (supposedly) and I still can barely get a signal it's kind of frustrating.  Sirens every night is not uncommon, it's not in the best area. I would probably stay here again as a just a place to park, I wouldn't want to live here and like I said it's nothing to write home about."
2,1,"No Pool, No Clubhouse, No Showers, No Hot Water in Restrooms , strong sewer smell in all Restrooms, Rude Ranger, Tight RV spots, Dusty and dirty! 
Sums it up. I would never stay here again! 
Go to Arizona Charlie's or Las Vegas Rv Resort!"
2,1,"This is just a dirt parking lot..no phone signal but they don't provide wifi for their guests either.crappy tv, thank goodness we have satellite . The people are very nice but for the dues we pay it's very sub par. If our kids didn't live here we wud never stay here. The streets are so narrow it's almost impossible to back into the site as the cars block the road even more. No pull thru for big rigs."
2,1,"It's a Company built on False Promises and Encourages its Employees to lie for one another.

This one has more amenities listed than most.

Gets worse as you travel through Oregon and Washington 

Join a different camping club.  KOA"
2,3,"We would certainly stay here again even though its not the best RV park...but its all about location, location, location.

NOTE:  This park requires that all sewer lines be kept off of the ground per county ordinance. 

Lets start with the positives.  
- It is within 4-5 miles from the strip, Freemont Street and the Las Vegas Convention Center.
- It is within walking distance to Boulder Station Casino
- We used Uber and had no problems getting picked up or dropped off
- Next door to RV repair and parts shops.  Also, a very active RV repair service inside the park.
- Nice, clean pool and rec room.
- The price is right if you are a Thousand Trails Camping member!
- Great water pressure for the showers
- Grounds were well maintained
- Good customer service

Finishing with the ""not so positives""
- Its in a rough part of town.  You can walk to the nearest casino but you need to be careful during the day and I would never do it at night.
- The bathrooms and showers desperately need updating
- If you are not a Thousand Trails member...buy a Thousand Trails Camping Pass.  Otherwise, the place is WAY TO EXPENSIVE.  RV sites on Boulder Highway, and there are a lot of them, run about $22 a night.  Without participating in the Thousand Trails program, the daily fees are almost twice as expensive! 
-  Its noisy at night.  Police sirens and helicopters all night long on Boulder Highway.
-  Very tight spaces.  Think carefully before backing into your space.  If you want any chance of having a sitting and eating area...you need to strategically back your RV in
- Pool is excellent but it closes at 6 PM.  Why?  Because they have a long term electrical issue that hasn't been fixed (affects the lighting).
- Pool is excellent but NO SHADE during the day.  The sun can be unbearable and we wanted to use the pool but had nowhere to sit due to the lack of shade.
- They seemed to have major problems with their laundry equipment.  A lot of ""out of order"" signs

We have a Thousand Trails Camping Pass so we will come back and stay here.  They have a lot they can fix if they want to improve the RV'ers experience but there are somethings they get dinged for that are just part of being on a major thoroughfare in the middle of town (for some that is why they are there).  Overall, a good stay."
2,3,"TENTERS BEWARE!!

we stayed here for 2 nights in early april in a tent.  I am going to be fair to this resort (although I hated las vegas as a whole and also as a sum of its parts).  Don't tent camp at this thousand trails unless you want to sleep on asphalt.  The ranger was very nice to us, and took us to the one site that could possibly accommodate a tent.  As far as facilities: bathrooms, lodge, pool, etc were all really nice!  Just to know, it is located on  a busy street, but backs up to a building, and the noise wasn't an issue.  It was very windy when we were there, but if you have an RV it probably wouldn't matter.  Judging by the cement walls with barbed wire, this is probably the only safe place to stay in Las Vegas."
2,1,"This place is horrible.  You better get a spot RIGHT NEXT to a Bathroom/shower place if you want WIFI.  Anywhere else in the park has NO WiFI, even the one in the club house is horrid.  No one is on the same page here, we got conflicting information from each worker here. They change your reservation weeks without telling you. The showers are laid out REALLY stupid.  Each bathroom has 2 showers and the changing area is shared by the TWO showers.  HELLO RAPE.  Its right by a shady apartment complex where the residents are yelling at each other.  It doesn't even have cable hook up you have to use an antennae. The ""Gym"" is a complete joke you couldn't even stretch in their without bumping into the wall.  Its like one of the rooms they put you in at a mental institute so you don't hurt yourself which is exactly what I wanted to do while staying here. Seriously, this place needs an upgrade its really old and needs to change."
2,1,"We are Thousand Trails owners for 8 years now and our 1st visit here! Let me start by saying that this location is right next door to a hotel that has prostitution! Each time we would return these provacatively dressed women would flag us down. We brought another couple that had their car flagged too! Embarrassing!  Our view was of the hotel...need i say more...now to the cabin...yes, we rented a cabin for 3 days. It was listed as it sleeps 4...it was a mini futon for short ppl! 2 adults did not fit! Had to use a blow up bed... the bathroom and bedroom doors had no door knobs..just the holes where they were missing...no privacy! The blinds were broken, burned...horrible.  I began the supply list that they left on the counter...bowls were missing, dish strainer nowhere to be found etc..i called the check in station to let them know..he said he would have housekeeping come by in the morning to fix the issues...no one ever came. I never write reviews but for this i thought I should before someone spends money and time at this place.  I wished i had known..."
2,3,"The cabin we booked was on the small side and is in need of upgrades, badly. The shower was not the cleanest and the door opened directly into the toilet, which made it tricky to maneuver. Their clubhouse/pool area was not open, and many members said that it seems fishy as to why they are not opening it again. There was no wifi. I don't know if I would stay here again."
2,1,"Sadly, we had to part ways with TT. A host lingering problems with the park. The clubhouse has been defunct since February 2016, no Wi-Fi, the bathrooms are not cleaned, a certain staff member's customer service and now with the new management, there's a ""status-quo"" at the park. When TT corporate bosses came into Las Vegas on 12/27/2016, there were ""special letters"" given to long-time residents. We were one of them. Due to 'status'. Most RV parks don't accept 'older rigs' because of looks but we were . And that's fine, but TT has lost a valued member and that's fine with me as well... Thank you!"
2,3,"Our second time here. Last time the place was absolutely packed. Now that it's summer it has definitely cleared out.

Staff is very friendly and helpful. Helped us choose a site that has a bit of shade. Spots are close together, but in the space we are in this time at least there is a bit of room between rigs. Roads are narrow and a bit tight.

Small pool but very clean with some nice chairs available. There are a couple of horseshoe pits that are in the shade.

The lodge/activity center is small but well maintained.

Small, older bath/shower houses but they are kept quite clean.

This is a fine option for while in Vegas if you are here to visit Vegas. Not really the campground for just hanging around and spending your day in."
2,1,"Beware.... Terrible park, pool and clubhouse closed for a year. Open again only to close again for landscaping. No hot water in bathroom for over a month. Spaces way to tight and no place to park your car except on the street.  One of  worst TT although most are very bad, this one is just terrible."
2,1,"They don't really deserve one star except for a few underpaid employees that actually do care.Corporate does not., After thousand trails gets your money they could care less if you ever come back. Think about it its to there advantage if you never come back.. Other than social media they would laugh all the way to the bank.  Las Vegas just close its pool again.... no reason other than corporate said to do so...Its 109 here and now pool is closed.  
C
DO NOT JOIN.  CHECK OUT SOME OF THEIR ""RESORTS"" THEY ARE A jOKE. EVERY YEAR THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE OF YOUR MONEY.... NOW $5 A DAY FOR 50 AMPS.... NEXT YEAR A CHARGE FOR THE POOL.... JUST WAIT AND SEE."
2,3,We just spent the weekend at this resource and for the price we pay i guess is ok is not the top of the line place to stay in Vegas but if you are in a badget is ok!!!  The cabin is ok clean but the bed sheets are not very clean there were hairs all over the fitted sheet and the breadspread was dirty! The sorroundings were nice and clean i liked it but i will not stay there again though!!!
2,1,I don't know what it takes for the staff here at the Las Vegas Thousand Trails to enforce the County ordinance that requires rubber Donuts on the sewer connections. I have brought this issue up multiple times here and also written member services and sent them pictures yet no one here seems to care. Without the rubber Donuts sometimes it smells when the wind blows. The County ordinance is there for a reason it's a health issue.
2,4,"Not much to say about this campground once you realize what it is and what if isn't. 

It's a campground in Las Vegas. Nothing glamorous or ritzy but it's in the thousand trails network so essentially makes it almost free to stay in Vegas. 

It is very cramped, hard to fit in, and, if you're a single traveler with a trailer be careful of what road you turn down in the park. 

That said, all the sites are basic full hookups, and there are only a couple pull through sites."
2,4,Nice pool looks like a parking lot not as nice as the other one we've been to the on at verde valley was the best so far in my opinion activity center nothing to boast about
2,1,"Well the good ..
 The pool is open after 2 years. The bad there's no shade at the pool because the staff let the wind ruin all the umbrellas. Trying to think what else is good but not much unfortunately there are some new staff members here could have let the place go down hill. One example is they no longer enforce people using the required rubber Donuts on their sewer connection so the place stinks when the wind blows. They have also made it extremely difficult for us to have visitors here. Lot of things need to be fixed and nothing is getting fixed."
2,3,"We stayed here for the night as a stop on our way to Yellowstone.  The front office was friendly at check-in and escort us to our spot to make sure we fit in the spot they assigned to us.  

Pros:  
Friendly staff
restrooms were clean
close to off-strip casinos
quiet while we were there.

Cons:
NO shade
Sketchy part of town
funny smell
dirty look


would stay there again but not as a vacation spot."
2,1,do not stay here no matter what. my wife met 2 homeless coming out of the bathroom and the rangers at the gate did not even see them leave. talked to the manager about homeless sleeping in the bathrooms and he did not care. this park is very unsafe and the dirtiest rv park I have ever been to. I will not be staying here again and I have a thousand trails membership.
2,2,"Its ok.  We thought it was a great deal at a little over $18/night (until we drive by neighboring rv parks that looked nicer and were cheaper).

Everything is relatively clean and its sport quiet here, which I love.  However, you can smell the sewer line, the pavement is pretty old and the restrooms and showers are really small. 

I kind of feel like they really don't put much money into this park.  Its finally not an rv resort.  I would like to add that the shower heads are great, the staff and other campers are all friendly and helpful, and I really wish we were staying another day because the pool looks amazing! 

All things considered,  we would come back if the neighbouring rv parks are overbooked.  Its nice enough,  bit at some cheaper price you can get something better just down the road.

PS: there are very few spots of grass and mostly has gravel.  Also,  there is a small dog park with a bench and a couple of huge shady trees."
2,1,They have terrible customer service. We have been on hold for HOURS trying to change our reservation and have been given no contact or feedback. Do not trust. This star isn't even deserved.
2,5,"My Thoughts: This is one of the best thousand trails we've been to. Our site was gravel & level. The staff assigned us a spacious spot that we liked.Our site was #44 a corner spot so I didn't have neighbors on both sides of me.  Its inexpensive if you are a member.

The campground is close to Boulder Station casino. The prime rib dip sandwich in the Boulder Station Grand Cafe is yummy!

Getting to the strip was easy I took the fwy right to the Las Vegas strip. I got off the fwy on Tropicana and parked at the Excalibur casino. Then we walked to New York-New York Casino for a Greenberg's Deli sandwich called the Italian Stallion ...its always excellent.

The staff & campers have been friendly to us. Some campers offered to play Mexican train with us in the activities center but we had other commitments that evening. What a friendly bunch of campers here!

2.5,5,I recently purchased my 3rd truck  from ST&D and as always i am very happy with my purchase. JT and Mark are great to do business with and I would highly recommend Sonoran truck and Diesel if you are looking in the used market for a quality vehicle at a great price.
2.5,4,"Fantastic. The way buying a truck should be. I had been looking for a 06 or 07 classic 2500hd with the LBZ engine for months. Most of what I saw was running from $25k-35k, yikes. I happened to come across a new listing on eBay for a white one located in Phoenix. Score. In town. It was a Friday and I called the number listed on their web page after seeing whom the seller was in eBay. I believe I spoke to JT. He said he was the owner and that they were closed on the weekends but the truck was still available. My husband took work off Monday so we could go see it. I called at 10am on Monday and spoke with Mark, he said to come down whenever to take a look. We arrived at noon and was surprised by the location. We were expecting to see a dealership, instead we rolled up on a building with a large back lot that had a shit ton of nice looking trucks. I found her right away. Mark came out to greet us, and with no problems but a photo copy of hubs license let us drive her away to be checked out my the mechanic. We drive her hard to check into the garage for a scope. He said there were about $1k in problems but for the price (mechanic has the same exact truck, 07 classic 3500 diesel) he would jump on it and can take to him to fix. We returned to the lot and asked what the bottom dollar was and he came down $1k. We agreed. We didn't show up with financing available so he sent us to Andrew and Mt FCU and we were able to call and get approved, with a trip to see Andrew right down the street-all awhile Mark was addressing some minor issues we had with truck, and before you know it...I was off with a truck I loved. 3 hrs all in all with a 1.5 hr trip to mechanic included. Was a great experience. I would come here again. Son wants an LBZ as well so thinking this would be a great place to let them know we're looking. It's like having a friend in the business. When u buy used. Ur buying used. Shits gonna need to be fixed. Know that. Too think a used truck is perfect and as explained in ad is very immature. Do it diligence and have someone inspect before you buy. This is a great truck. With a ton of extras not even advertised. Just got my plates in the mail, tight!! Waiting for my personalized ones to show up now."
2.5,1,"Total crap mark, that truck was GUSHING fluid out of the overflow bottle the day the shipper dropped it off.  I never had a chance to put that truck  under heavy load, scratch that, ANY load.  You sold me a truck with a bad head gasket and knew something was wrong because there was some sort of silicone in the overflow canister, my guess was to cover it up.  Either way you all knew there was a problem and never made an attempt to make good.  Yes it is a diesel truck with 200k but I was assured and guaranteed that it was in great running condition.  Stay clear of this shady business!!!!"
2.5,1,"I completely agree with the previous 2 reviews. Purchased an F250. Add describes a  ""beautiful"" truck. These guys are PRO'S at covering up damage and problems. The typical used car BS. New carpet is the first sign something is wrong with your vehicle!!!!! Bring an expert with you if you even attempt to purchase something from these crooks. I mean a real expert. Inspect during the day and don't buy on impulse. Thats the mistake I made and it has cost me a lot of money. They are good talkers and cover up kings. Be wary"
2.5,1,"Where does one start?. I take a truck to my local mechanic and the report was not favorable. Rerurn the truck only to hear Mark say ""I took it to my mechanic so you disnt habe to"". The list was a complete front end rebuild and oil pump leak to top the list. He response was ""I knew about the front end"". The deacription fdom the AD was tight steering, very responsive. How about never had a leak (according to the ad)?. The repair for the leak is $4200. Then there was the airbag light, it was intermitten (safety man, safety). Then the topic of value of the truck came up....I stated what it was worth because of the issues and he stoemed off, not saying a word. The truck has continued to be offered of ebay. I asked if the issues have been fixed and the response I received was "" what issues are yoy speaking about""."
2.5,1,"Let me start by saying I would not recommend that anyone buy from Sonoran Truck and Diesel......  I purchased a 2006 Chevy Silverado 3500 Duramax 6.6L DRW from Sonoran Truck and Diesel on 10/1/2016 and was promised that the vehicle was mechanically in excellent condition.  When it was time for the vehicle to be shipped I received an email explaining that when the shipper came to pick up the vehicle he found a large puddle of coolant and could not accept the vehicle.  I was told it was the water pump and  they would replace it.  When the vehicle finally arrived it was gushing coolant out.  Called Sonoran Truck and Diesel and advised the owner JT Wamsley of the problem.  Took the vehicle to my local mechanic, the thermostat by pass tube was cracked and needed to be replaced, both thermostats needed to be replaced, the transmission cooling lines needed to be replaced, the coolant overflow bottle was clogged with what appeared to be some kind of PUTTY and a carrier bearing needed to be replaced.  I advised Sonoran Truck and Diesel of all the issues and I would send them the bill once the work was completed.  When it was time to collect JT argued and said the truck was fine when it left and offered only $500.00...  The coolant issue continued after all the work was done, and after the mechanics replaced all these items that did need to be replaced they found that the head gaskets were blown.  Now JT at Sonoran truck and Diesel will not cover the repair of nearly $6,000.00  Needless to say, I will be seeing JT Wamsley in court..  Horror story, stay clear of Sonoran Truck and Diesel."
2.5,1,"Very disappointed.  Let me first tell you about the first meeting I had with Sonoran Truck.  It was on the weekend and we set a time to meet via text message.  I drive all the way across town and the salesman that was supposed to meet me was not there and the place was locked up tight.  I tried calling him and he did not answer his phone.  So about 15 minutes later he sends me a text as I am sitting in front of the locked gate at the business that I just drove all the way from West Glendale to the dealer ship, and he say's, I have to take my daughter somewhere so we need to reschedule.  My reply was, so, I drove all the way across town for nothing?  Then, he finally agreed to come meet me as I am just about to give up and go home.  I really liked the truck I was there to see and we made a deal.  I did not buy a warranty.  They told me they had the truck thoroughly checked out and all is well.  Well after the 15 day warranty expired that they provided with the deal, I started having problems.  I have had it to two transmission shops, paid another company to diagnose the engine, had to replace two batteries, and now approximately two months after I bought it, I had to have the turbo replaced.  I had the work done at a shop they recommended.  I tried contacting the salesman after getting nowhere with the owner other then a referral of where to take it for diagnose and repair, and of course he would not answer the phone, so , I left him a very nice voicemail asking for help to resolve this problem.  He failed to return my call.  I tried calling him several times again and he did not answer.  So I finally sent him a text and told him I was going to post ads on craigslist where he post's trucks for sale and warn potential customers of how Sonoran Truck operates after the sale.  He did not like  it and responded right away.  So, by the time our text conversation was over, he said there is nothing he can do to help me.  I even told him that I don't expect them to cover the whole bill but it sure would say alot about Sonoran Truck if they would cover half of it.  No such luck."
2.5,3,"You are totally right. I really do feel that it was my fault for buying that truck on impulse. 

No competition here. I just feel that people need to know to inspect the vehicle closely and don't do it at night. My mistake. 

Truck was covered in mud and rust inside of the dashboard. I didn't notice until I had to figure out  what was wrong with the trailer brake controller. so I went and looked under the dash and it was completely covered in surface rust and a thick layer of dirt and caked up crap everywhere. pigtail for controller was completely corroded. replaced the controller and pigtail. 

The body was touched up EVERYWHERE, and it was blended nicely. So at night I didn't notice. But as the weeks went on and it was washed a few times, all of those touchups started coming off and all of the scratches became clear.

A bedliner was put in to cover how trashed the bed really was looked like a lot of concrete was hauled in the truck. . some spots were actually punctured through the metal. And of course the 5th wheel hitch holes were still there under the bed. 

Ad described a truck that had been freshly serviced and ready to go. Air filter and oil filter had over 12k on them. I knew this because someone wrote the miles that they were replaced at, on the filter. The oil was in terrible shape.. This was clearly an oilfield truck or some construction company's rig.

In closing, the sales tactics were great and the vehicle had the right upgrades to really draw in a buyer based on impulse. Again I understand that this was totally my fault for completely trusting what I was being told, buying on impulse, and not inspecting during the day. This is why I never wasted my time trying to get these issues addressed. There were other issues but at this point it doesn't matter anymore. I learned a lesson.

In sonoran's defense, maybe you guys didn't know about all those issues and the company you use in Tempe to do all the upgrades didn't say anything either.

No matter what, the purpose here is to share my experience in buying a truck from you guys. That's why I chose to rate 3 stars because at the end of the day it was still my fault. So perhaps 1 star isn't too fair?"
2.5,1,No need to continue with the back and forth. Read the BBB review andbyou will see thevtrue colors of this business
2.5,1,"Well, the crooks down at Sonoran are still hard at work screwing hard working people. Its time everyone single person who has had a negative run in with these guys file a conplaint with BBB and make sure to leave some kind words on their website. After all....they like to say they have a stellar record on ebay.....from people they buy parts from.

Companies like make it difficult for anyone to trust the small guy dealership."
2.5,1,"Your response is a total lie.  Yes, you referred me to a transmission shop, and yes you referred me to a diesel shop that installed a new turbo and to this day, I still have the same problem with the truck.  I have given up on trying to fix this problem because no one seems to know how to fix it.  Maybe that's why you wanted to trade trucks with me.  And for your comment of you trying to call me and leaving me messages, that is total bull.  I was not asking you to pay the whole bill, I was asking you to split it with me.  And as far as you leaving me a message the night before, that is bull as well.  When I arrived on our agreed time, you where nowhere to be found.  After finally getting a reply after texting you and waiting hoping you would reply after I drove all the way across town to see your truck, you then asked me if we could reschedule.  We can keep this going back and forth if you want to, but I think it would be best if you don't respond to this again.  I still have the same problem with the truck after all this time  and I am forced to live with it because I don't have time to keep taking it to repair shops."
5,5,My boyfriend and I will be full time RVers starting next month. We have been browsing/shopping for RVs since January and have been to many different dealerships. We love Integrity RV and knew we wanted to buy from them. They have been so patient with us stopping by to look at their inventory. We did this for 8 months until we were finally ready to buy. The experience has been great from the start. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an RV. No pressure. Feels like they really care about helping you find the right fit for your situation.
5,5,"I've bought more than a few Rv's over the years, and I have to say this family owned business is the very best! If you want great service and great prices this is the place to go. I bought a diesel pusher Motorhome and had a few problems after the sale, they took care of every issue no questions asked! Thanks guys we will be back for out next one!"
5,5,"My husband and I have been searching for 2 years for the ""right"" motor coach. We knew what we wanted and just kept searching until the right one came along. We had our eye one at Integrity RV and the price was dropped within our budget so we made a call to them on Friday and the following Thursday we made a two day trip to Arizona in good faith that the coach would be as promised. 
We were not disappointed! With a few minor issues that were taken care of at the dealership and a few along the road back home, these folks were absolutely top notch in customer service!
There were no surprises and they gave us an honest value for our trade in. 
We have had to call Integrity since our purchase and have always been greeted with a friendly voice and willingness to help in any way possible. From the very first phone call, we have been impressed with this family owned and operated business. 
No fuss, no muss, just honest good people!
EVERYONE at Integrity RV is awesome, you can't go wrong.
We purchased a 2012 Allegro Phaeton and couldn't be happier.
Sincerely,
Bill and Stephanie Burt
Spring Creek Nevada"
5,5,"Kevin and his brothers are an absolute joy.  We had been searching for an RV for years and traveled from Chicago to do business with them.  They helped us pick out the perfect one.   Their service person went through every detail of the RV with us.  They are easy to contact, always available for questions, true gentlemen.  They would make their mother proud.   Thanks team!"
4,5,We live in Northern California and just bought a fifth wheel from them. We have had great service and the most friendly courteous people that have bent over backwards to help us.
4,1,"Answered the phone hello like I was bothering her. Had to ask if I had the business. Called this place to see about an oil change. The lady on the phone was so rude. Still don't know if they do oil changes, nor do I care now."
4,4,They have a wide selection of used RV'S  it's not a bad plac we to look if you're looking for used.
4,2,"Just bought a used 2015 Heartland Sundance from these guys. They were very easy to deal with and completed our transaction quickly, however, they were suppose to clean it before we picked it up. They had 2 weeks. When we arrived, we could tell it wasn't very clean. They ""re-vacuumed"".  After we left, we stayed the night in it and when I split some water on the floor, I wiped it up, only to find that the floor was filthy! Lucky my bleach wipes go everywhere with me so I quickly re-cleaned everything. We called and left a message with Eddie that we were disappointed and had some reservations that all the systems were thoroughly checked.  He said that he would have Randy call us back and give us some money back. It's been 5 days and no call has been received. What a disappointment.  if they only would've had made an attempt to call us and made good on their promise, this would be a 5 Star review."
4,5,"I purchased a beautiful new Pleasure Way from  Edward, a stellar salesman, who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about the Lexor and explained all the systems thoroughly. After several hours online doing my own research, I made trips to other dealers to look at their inventory. Honestly, there was not one single salesman or saleswoman in three different states who had the depth of knowledge and comprehensive understanding of what I was wanting in my new class B. Edward showed no impatience and answered all my questions thoroughly. Throughout my multiple visits to this dealership, I felt I was treated with respect and negotiated a great deal. There was no heavy-handed or back room pressure and the manager, Tom, was very accommodating with my logistics and the trade-in on my old RV. I met the owner, Adam, who sincerely thanked me for my business. All in all, a great buying experience! I highly recommend this group of people if you would like an honest and fair deal!!"
4,4,"Never judge a book by its cover.

Recently took my new 5-month old 2013 PleasureWay Plateau TS RV for service here because its the only PW certified dealer in the area. Pulling in, it looks like a Mom and Pop place with old small office building and outdoor service facility (i.e., a car porch for RV) and I was a little worried. Since the PleasureWay is based on a Mercedes Sprinter van platform, we had taken it to the local fancy, upscale Mercedes dealer for engine and chassis service which cost us nearly $400 for an oil change, fluid check, and general check up. Anyway, the Mercedes dealer has its own Starbucks, valet parking, business center, etc., so you know where that money goes!

But Auto Corral RV service manager Melissa and technician Chris quickly assuaged my concerns. They installed a replacement rear view mirror with back up monitor (previously got a replacement from manufacturer), and got my LP stove burners to work for the first time. They patiently spent time answering my, and my wife's, questions about the RV (we couldn't do that with dealer we bought from because we did a fly-in buy out of state) on other things we newbies were mystified about. And they told us about a manufacturer paid program for doing tire alignment for shimmy and bounce problems and referred us down the street to Big O Tires for a free alignment. When we went to do paperwork, we were told there was no charge!

These folks are honest and knowledgeable, and have truly earned my trust and future business. When you think of service, what else do you need other than an honest contractor who knows what they are doing??

I still think the way Class B RV manufacturers split up warranty responsibility between chassis and engine, coach and RV, and different appliance makers is a crazy quiltwork which makes it so hard for owners to figure out who is responsible for maintenance and warranty!"
4,5,"I put my RV there on consignment. They did a great job. They kept me in the loop, they communicated well and they took care of everything so I did not have to. It was a pleasant experience and I recommend anyone who wants to sell their RV on consignment to go to auto corral RV"
4,1,"I am a female business owner living in California.  Contacted Auto Corral RV via RVT.com.  Eddie promptly called back to say the RV I inquired about was sold, but he had another.  Eddie seemed reluctant about my questions regarding pre-purchase inspection and vehicle history reports, and indicated that someone else would call me back.  No call back.  

Got the impression they didn't want to negotiate with a female, shame on you Auto Corral RV.  Women are emerging as the new, largest buying group for Recreational Vehicles according to the current demographics.  

this post will be updated if  Auto Corral RV contacts me back.  Otherwise Ladies--take your business where women are treated as equal.  Good luck gals."
4,1,"I deleted this post a few weeks back in hopes they would return my call and possibly help me.  I had no such luck so I am reposting this and going to leave it up.

I recently bought a 2018 Sandpiper 379FLOK from an out of state dealer and I needed some warranty work done and tried to take it in to this local dealer and was basically told we'll call you when we feel like it cause you didn't buy it from us.  I'll never go back or even recommend anyone to go there for fear they'll be treated like me and waste their time."
4,5,"I flew from Santa Barbara to Phoenix and rented a car to get to Auto Corral RV and buy the used Pleasure-Way Lexor TS on their lot, if the camper was as they described it.  It was, their service was straight forward, prompt,  courteous snd complete  in every way, and I bought the camper.   They are honest and treat people well:  I realized after signing the contract that the camper had just one, not two, roof solar panels--a surprise to them, too--and they promptly reduced the already-agreed-to price by the cost of the panel.  Follow-up service--they're  a service point for Pleasure-Way--has also been great, Allie is really on the ball. Last note--the Lexor TS is beautifully planned and built, and a real pleasure to drive--a great Class B live-aboard camper! Five stars to Auto Corral RV in Mesa!"
4,4,"just purchased a consigned toy hauler.  Had great service from the staff. They made extra sure our vehicle was equipped properly to drive off with our purchase.  Staff could not have been any friendlier.   We live a long way off, so when a couple of items needed replacing, they said just go have it taken care of and send them the bill.  People like this made our ""fun"" purchase even more fun.  Thanks"
4,5,"I boght a used Pleasure-Way camper van from this business about 8 months ago and posted a 5-star review of that experience.   After 5700 miles on my current road trip, i stopped in to have some repair and replacement work done.   These people are awesome!  Parts were ordered and installed, custom improvements to a major kitchen drawer were beautifully and quickly done, and insurance guru Allie went to bat for me and  took care of all the paperwork.  All this when they were short-staffed.  My experience:  this is an honest, responsive and caring business.  A big thanks to their staff!"
4,5,Auto Corral RV is A+ my wife and I are enjoying our new 2017 bullet premier the staff and Ken the salesman are great to deal with. Ken leaves out the BS (Bull Shit ) and I like that he is a man of his word I would definitely highly recommend this place to buy an RV from. I'm sorry I forgot the gentleman's name in the back with the blonde hair younger guy is awesome very funny to deal with even if its 115 degrees he made sure my truck and trailer is hooked up correctly and did a great job.
4,5,"Just bought a used 2015 Heartland Sundance from these guys. They were very easy to deal with and completed our transaction quickly. After we took delivery of unit, we found that it was not cleaned.  I posted an unfavorable review and was contacted by the owner the very next day. Since we live in North North Scottsdale, they set up to have our unit cleaned by a mobile service. They showed up on time and did an excellent job. My carpets look like new. So happy. Thank you for the prompt service. We will recommend you to all of our friends."
4,5,"We are so pleased with our experience at Auto Corral. Eddie helped us get our 5th wheel to their location and when we went in to check on the status we found it had just been sold! Tom handled the paperwork and everything went thru without a hitch.....no pun intended! Thank you guys, we are so happy."
4,5,"Auto Corral RV is a winner!  Buy from them and they will stay with you until you are happy.  Our slide out motor failed a few days after we bought our used (without warranty) Fleetwood Southwind South Motorhome.  No problem for this honest dealer. The manager, Shawn Williams, send his contact Toby Kallenberger to our home in California for personal service.  Toby ordered a new motor and came back to our home to install it at no charge!  We are elated!  Thank you Shawn and Toby.  We are your customers for life.  We recommend this dealer for your next RV purchase."
4,1,"I purchased a 5th wheel for Auto Corral. It was a consigned unit. We heard all the right ""things"" when we showed interest. After we agreed to the terms, it was over a month and I hadn't received the title or license plates (we paid cash).  It wasn't until I called that I found out there was a problem with the title.  After threatening them to demand my money back, the title and plates miraculously appeared. The sales staff (big joke) is clueless. And when the  head honcho Tom talks to you, you better have some handy wipes with you. He wasn't even sure of info on the sales order! My advice  would be  either  to hold back some money until you receive your purchase or make them show you the title.  Or better yet go elsewhere.  By the way it took over 3 weeks for them to deliver the trailer. They offered to do that since I hadn't purchased a truck yet to pull the trailer. One excuse after another why the delay. Lastly make sure you get things as promised. The person who did our walked around promised some replacement parts...still waiting for them.  Just remember you have choices where to buy from. Choose wisely!"
4,5,We purchased a travel trailer from Auto Corral back August of 2018. The entire process was very smooth and everyone involved was knowledgable. On delivery the tech went through all aspects of the operation of our trailer and answered all questions. All the staff was very friendly and made us feel comfortable in working with them. I highly recommend these folks for an RV purchase or getting your rig serviced.
4,5,Amazing campground! Love it! Very clean and peaceful. Love the lake & game room. Showers house is clean and have washer and dryers. AWESOME place!
4,5,"The staff is friendly and helpful, we are new to owning a Camping trailer and had some power issues at 9pm- two staff members came out to help troubleshoot and gave us a ton of tips and advice. Our kids were entertained all day, the Halloween in August trick or treating and hayrides were a ton of fun. The campground is clean and well maintained, my only tiny complaint would be that the site we had was small and right night to our neighbors- but everything else was perfect."
4,3,"This park has potential however it's being held back by a few things. 

1. Mostly permanent residents. The ones behind site 10 where we were liked to get drunk and party all night. Last I checked the time it was 12am and they were still out there being loud and obnoxious. They also had a very loud truck or motorcycle they liked to turn on a rev up every so often. As one does at 12am... you know for fun.

2. This is not a cheap campground. Over $40/night however they charge extra for WiFi. No thanks. At least there was good  T-Mobile reception.

3. The water is nasty. I'm not even sure if this is potable water. I felt I needed to get a tetanus shot before taking a shower. Stunk big time of rusty nail.

On the positive side, sites are gravel so you don't have to deal with a muddy mess and they are decent size, not huge but you can't shake your neighbors hand from the window either. Has a nice pond."
4,5,"Wow, wow, wow! If we could give more than 5 stars, we would!  We drove in from Florida and as soon as we pulled in, we were greeted like family! Bob, the owner, escorted us to our site but then suggested we might be a better fit in another spot. Good idea, Bob! While backing in, he decided a tree limb needed cut to avoid damaging our A/C and we needed needed boards to level our back end out. His brother (I think brother) and 2 young employees went and got a small Bobcat to cut the tree limbs down and wood planks for the rig! Who else would do that?? We committed to a year here and come next year will probably extend. Don't pass this place up!"
4,5,"Outstanding ! Mike is awesome took us in middle of night, still escorted us to our site and helped set us up. Showers have that nice well water smell lol but other then that top notch service and camp site. Highly recommend."
4,5,"Excellent place to camp and hang out for the weekend! My friends and I have been coming here every Fourth of July weekend for the past 3 years. The staff is friendly, and the fireworks are awesome too. Reasonably priced as well, with clean bathrooms and other amenities."
4,1,"We stayed at this park for 3 days in September and it was really ""meh.""  The sties are really on top of each other, with the sewage hookups for our neighbor right outside of our door.  The park is practically filled with permanent residents, and many of them are in pretty ramshackle rigs.  In fact, there was a derelict Class C parked next to us on the lawn (we were in site no. 1 so there should have be no one next to us at all) the whole time we were there.  Many of the rigs have decks and porches, and some of them are falling apart.  The place is not very clean.  The bath room  trash wasn't emptied the whole time we were there and the showers were pretty dirty.  The water was very hard and tasted of iron and it actually stained the side of my rig where the connection leaked.  There is a community room above of the bathrooms, but it wasn't open any of the days we were there.  I would not stay there again."
4,3,"Decent campground in this area. Sites are large, power is stable. We had 50 amp service. Park has a lake for swimming and catch & release fishing. Several playgrounds and a game room for the kids. Fire pits at each site. Didn't use the showers so no comment in these. We were in a area with mostly seasonal campers and it was pretty quiet.  The interior roads are rock and gravel. Bumpy and uneven in places. Management and workers were nice and helpful.  They do wagon rides on the weekends. No cable, but we were able to get about 25 channels on the antenna. Not great channels over the air though. Wifi is through a private provider and I thought they were expensive.     Site was rock and gravel but pretty level. We even had a wooden patio attached to our site. We had a monthly rate i thought was good value, but I think their nightly rate us a bit high. Not s lot of camping options in this area of Ohio."
4,5,"Love this place! Great staff, great campground we visit almost every year. (Maybe I shouldn't tell you about this place so I can can get my favorite site.) 
Camp on!"
2.5,1,"This is not a resort! It is a rv park with hookups next to a large truck stop with a fabulous view of the freeway. Minimal landscaping, no water features, no tables at your site, no grass, not gated, no clubhouse. Basically all the things you would expect to see at a ""resort"" are not here. And it is way overpriced. It sits right on the 10 fwy which is extremely noisy!! While it is clean that's about the only positive thing I have to say about the place! Oh and yes it's priced like a resort!!!!
When I spoke my concerns to management I didn't even get an I'm sorry your not happy. How can we rectify the situation. Just a comment that I should of looked at the aerial view.  Not my idea of good customer service, especially from a ""resort""."
2.5,1,"This is a complete ripoff!  There is no one to help in the office if a problem arises, rounded curbs become ankle-breakers (especially at night), the owners have customer service as a concept, not a practice.  They deprived us of power for a whole night because they had turned off the breaker that powered our assigned site. Then they refused any reduction of their exceptionally high charges for that privilege!  The noise from I-10 is made worse by the race car driving experience just the other side of the highway.  At times the TV was drowned out.   NEVER AGAIN!!!

Manager Bob- the breaker issue was never our problem. The only breaker that was shut off was in YOUR NEARBY LOCKED MAIN BOX. Nice try."
2.5,4,"Our storage is across the street as well as a casino (king & louies) and a speedway ( which always has events). What they do have is brand new, dog park, laundry room and bathrooms with 24/7 security. The resort part is it is rv only, No trailers."
2.5,2,What an astounding rip off! Extremely expensive for just a park in a parking lot directly next to NOISY I-10! Wow. Across the highway is a casino you can stay at and have same amenities for free. There's also reasonable rv parks in the area to stay at. I can't believe this place is even in business.
2.5,3,"The noise from I 10 is horrible.  If you have to stay here, request a site as far away from 10 as possible. This is a nice park with concrete pads but definitely not a resort. We won't stay here again."
2.5,1,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Don't count on a 3-4 hour response. I called about 2:30-3:00 pm for reservation.  Got the answering service both times explained both times I was on the road and needed to see if they had a space available. I never receive a courtesy call. I then sent them a message. They responded back to me 12 hours later. Staying they have late check in you go there and check for a space available!  You've got to be kidding.  Why would I drive to a place in a 31 footer with tow car and find out they have no space!   GET REAL!
2.5,5,"We stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. The concrete pads are level with full hook ups. The bathrooms were private air conditioned rooms with a toilet, sink and shower and all had security code entrances as well as the laundry. The grounds were well kept. The highway is nearby and visible but we weren't bothered by the car noise. There's a Love's station right around the corner. No fire rings, picnic tables or other amenities but that wasn't an issue for us. Would definitely stay here again. Great sunset views! We camped in our 36' class C."
2.5,2,"Not much of a resort.
I chose this site because of the location nearest my son. Some things that are lacking is a pool or any other amenities that would make you feel like you are at a resort. If you are looking for a stay this is very basic this is the place for you. It allows pets and all ages, but there is absolutely nothing for kids or families to do without leaving. Very disappointed. A few good things is the spots are spaced well apart. The Wi Fi is fast and the laundry facility is clean as well as the bathrooms and showers. When we had trouble with our water there was someone immediately there to help even though the office is across the street. 
We won't be staying here again. I would like a real resort with family-friendly things to do."
4.5,5,"Johnnie Walker is attentive, professional, fast and efficient.  Very dependable service.  Had an electrical issue and they not only fixed it but tested the entire system and had the work done in an hour.  Highly recommended!"
4.5,5,"I gave the guys at Johnny Walker RV every opportunity to rip me off. I took my RV in to get my water heater serviced and ready for the hard freeze. I pretended to know nothing at all about anything really. Instead of playing games and trying to make me pay for things I didn't need, they actually charged less than I had figured for even my most conservative estimates. I was late to my appointment and they still got me in the shop in a timely manner and kept me updated with phone calls throughout the entire process. I was even being sneaky and spying on their technicians discreetly from a distance and they simply do NOT mess around. I'm more pleased than I have ever been with their service center and they have earned all my future business to meet my RV needs. Thanks JWRV and my service writer Ed for striving for an unmatched level of professionalism."
4.5,5,"This is a great Las Vegas RV dealer. It's evidently the largest RV dealer in the State, and they provide top-notch service all around.

Christine helped us get a good deal on a nice coach. She was helpful throughout the purchase process, not pushy at all, and answered all our questions patiently. After the purchase, a courteous mechanic named Matt took about 3 hours of his time to teach us all about the onboard systems, which was all new to us being first-time RVers.

It was overall a great experience with Johnnie Walker RV, and I just happened to meet Mr. Johnnie Walker in person on the back lot. He was extremely courteous, shook my hand, and welcomed us to his family business. It's no wonder things run so well, it all starts at the top."
4.5,5,Love the service and attention our salesman Tom gave us! Johnny Walkers is a big business that's still treats like family!
4.5,5,Had a great time this summer in our RV we purchased a couple years ago from Johnnie Walker except when my husband dinged our trailer not bad but needed repair...we brought in for repair and had no problems worked with same service writer from start to finish he was very polite when we are ready for a our next trailer i cant imagine going anywhere else and LOVED the cool fish tank built in the trailer my kids went crazy over it
4.5,1,"I needed parts; called them and after holding for 20 minutes after I was ""transferred,"" I hanged up and went to their website (designed in perhaps 1985) and tried to order the part there. Except you can't order parts. You can only email them to ask if they have the parts, and they'll get back with you. On their time. 

After five days of waiting, and having left two messages for someone to call me back, I instead went to eBay and found the part for 156.00.

While waiting for eBay seller to ship, Johnny Walker's parts desk called me about the part, and put me on hold again while they searched for it. 7-8 minutes later, they informed me they didn't have it but could special order it (common electrical part for RV) for 249.99, nearly $100.00 more. Even CamperWorld was less at 188.98. 

Avoid these guys; they simply don't care about your money, time, or needs."
4.5,5,"Johnnie Walker saved the day!

We were on our way to Denver (6-30-16) with a caravan of travel trailers when a roof vent broke off of one of the trailers. The timing could not have been worse as there was a huge rain storm approaching complete with flash flood warnings. We now had a repair emergency.

Although the timing was terrible, it was also perfect (thank you Lord!) because a quick search showed that Johnnie Walker RV was not far away.

One call to their parts department was reassuring as they advised that they would have the part in stock no matter what style of vent we had. Sweet!

I'm so sorry I didn't get the gentleman's name from the parts department who helped us, but when we got there he immediately came out and helped us.  He not only identified the correct part we needed, but he actually took the broken remnants off!  What superb service!

After getting us the right new roof vent cover, they were kind enough to lend us a ladder so we could put the new vent on.  They even had a covered area right outside the parts dept so we had shelter from the rain during the installation. 

I would highly recommend Johnnie Walker RV if you are looking for the highest level of service. They have demonstrated to me the gold standard that is not often offered or obtained.

Thanks !"
4.5,5,They replaced my Hot Water Heater and the cooling unit in my refrigerator.  They did everything in a timely manner and within the costs that we projected.  The folks at Johnnie Walker are the best.  There are very few people that I allow to work on my Alfa and they are at the top of the list.  They are always helpful and explain what needs to be done.  Highly recommend these folks
4.5,5,"Cole & Micah are the best!!  Johnny Walker's service department really helped us out of a last minute repair issue!!

These guys and the entire team are absolutely great!"
4.5,5,"My wife and I decided to finally purchase an RV! After visiting other dealerships, we decided that the one-on-one training/orientation, 2 night overnight camping after purchase, and the professional and courteous team, made Johnnie Walkers our dealership of choice.

Sales: Overall, our salesman, JJ, worked with us to find the best RV that would meet our needs.  He was extremely knowledgable and very patient with a couple of RV newbies. 

Service: Jose, was responsible for setting up our travel trailer, providing RV training and making adjustments to anything we wanted corrected. He was amazing! Jose, resolved our minor issues with a can do attitude. He made our lives so much easier and he was thorough. 

The service and parts team was also extremely helpful and friendly. All of them provided support as though we were family members each time we had questions. That's rare. 

Were there things they could improve upon? Sure. That happens with every large purchase. 

My only suggestion - do your own homework. Make sure you gather your own information regarding what your vehicle can actually tow. Go by your truck dealership and get the actual facts. Don't rely on the Internet or people's opinions.

Kudos to the staff at Johnnie Walker's. We would definitely purchase from you again!"
4.5,4,"they do very good business, very polite, very professional 
you can visit their website here to check out some awesome deals http://bit.ly/1BFcvjI"
4.5,5,Customer sales service is very good and they are not pushy. Service staff is friendly and very helpful when you bring your RV in. This is family owned & operated.
4.5,5,"I understand now how this family owned company has been able to stay in business  50+ years. Everyone I've met has been so nice and really treat me like a part of the family. They all say hello, not just the sales reps either, they are attentive to questions and concerns, thorough in explaining things and responsive to my requests. I may not be on the family Christmas card, but I'm not just a number to them either. I would definitely stop in if and/or when you're in the market for this type of purchase or having issues with one you may already have."
4.5,5,"I waited to write this review till after I used my trailer a few times and took it in for it's first service. The reason being is because you can have the best sales person in the world and once they have your money it turns into a nightmare really fast. My friend and I bought travel trailers  the same exact week. I did my research and chose Johnny Walker RV based on not only the good reviews but because they are locally and family owned. My friend chose Camping World even though I warned him that the internet was full of horrible reviews about them but he totally ignored me and bought from them anyway and I can tell you first hand his experience has been a total nightmare compare to mine. 

From the first time I walked into JW RV it was smooth sailing, Jared Munk my sales guy was friendly and knowledgeable about everything I needed to know and guided me through the entire process without any issues. After looking at all the models I decided to go with the Jayco 26BHS and my only regret is that I wish I got the next model up with the larger bathroom.  


My friend who bought from Camping world and I went on our first trip together to Pachanga Lake (north campground) on Jared my sales guy's advise and it was great. I had no issues at all while my friend who bought the Key Stone Cougar had nothing but problems which ended up making my trip stressful because everything on his trailer kept breaking and I had to help him deal with all the BS. First we could not get the trailer off his truck because camping world hooked everything up wrong, then his gas valve broke and his stove and fridge quit working, then we could not get the trailer back on the hitch, then his bathroom door kept opening up driving down the road all while I had no major issues at all. After we returned my friend and I both dropped off our trailers for service, my list was short and I just needed a few things tightened up and my friend needed all his issues fixed. Well long story short my trailer was ready to pick up a few days later and more then a month later camping world is still waiting for Key Stone to give the green light to fix his stuff and my friend has missed out on using his trailer twice.


Bottom line is if you want a huge headache go buy your trailer or RV from anyone else other then Johnny Walker, if you want no hassles and great customer service from start to finish then Johnny Walker RV is the only choice in my opinion."
4.5,5,In this day and age we expect everything to be a big fight when we have problems. We bought a new 2016 Fuzion and had the AC not working properly. We went to Johnny Walker RV Center expecting a big fight on our hands. To our great surprise they did everything they could to make it right! Their customer service is not like anything we have ever seen! From the manager to service they went above and beyond to fix our AC and now works like a brand new unit should! Thanks so much from Gary and Nancy!
4.5,5,"Although the dealership didn't have specifically what I was looking for, Tom was very helpful and courteous. He stayed in touch with me and contacted me to let me know about new inventory. I just wish there was a person like Tom at all dealerships to make the buying process such a pleasant experience as Tom does at Johnny Walker RV. Thanks again Tom!"
4.5,5,"It has been six months since the RV purchase and I'm even more impressed with Johnnie Walker RV than the initial encounter.  Motorhomes are very complex to say the least. The service Manager, Ken Allen and his staff have been extremely helpful in processing minor warranty claims.  In addition, they have provided general pointers to maintain and get the most out of the unit.  The staff at Johnnie Walker RV are incredible and very helpful."
4.5,5,I wish we had gone there first . We new what we wanted and Sharri was able to find something in there inventory that fit perfectly . Darcy hit one over the fence with here help on financing . Tom explained everything perfectly . Joe back in parts was very knowledgeable and set us up with the extra things you need to make your camping experience more enjoyable . They treated us very nicely and we drove away feeling like we had joined a great organization . Other places made feel like I was buying a used car and were more interested in making a sale then helping us enjoy camping . They are the real deal !!!!
4.5,3,"While on a recent trip to Colorado a couple weeks ago I had a problem with the hydraulic jacks on my 2018 Road Warrior. After the warranty work just completed I got in touch with the service director Ken Allen who in turn got in touch with Brad, who on his day off called me and talked me through some troubleshooting which fixed the problem. I was able to jump a fuse to get the jacks and slides operating until I was able to replace the fuse with a new fuse relay. A big thanks goes out to Johnny Walker rv for such a quick response to my call for help. We were able to get on with our vacation with no further problems."
4.5,5,XLNT Service & no hassle sales! Todd in sales and Danny in service really helped when we bought our 2004 Montana. We stayed longer than anticipated and everyone helped with our transition.
4.5,5,"Now remember Johnnie Walker is a Dealer of Recreational Vehicles and Motor Homes, they are selling product not manufacturing it. I won't mention any manufacturers but when you buy from Johnnie Walker they back up what they sell. They are very busy yes and will address any manufacturers issues you might have. Again keep in mind that they don't control the factory they fix the screw ups from the factory and all the factories screw ups. Now these guys are the very best, When you need something stop by thier store, it may cost a bit more than Amazon but you will get the part you need, not the hose for your grill that is not the right part or have to wait until it is delivered. I can't say enough about the service. Try to get anything done with Camping world or Blue Dog RV and you have to wait 6 weeks. You guys Rock. Thank you."
4.5,1,Horrible terrible ! We paid 17 grand cash new trailer and they held our money! Until we showed our as social sec card! No financing just paid in full! And. Did not give receipt! And held money hostage. Unbelievable!! He wore a lot of man jewelry rude. All cause we were mom daughter. So if your a woman watch out!! And the brand new trailer fell apart after a month!! We wanted a 20 grand trailer but refused to finanance measly 3 grand when we putting down 17 grand!  We were real dumb for letting them keep our money hostage!!
4.5,2,"We had high hopes for Johnnie Walker RV. We were shopping for our first RV and became frustrated when we were passed off from salesperson to salesperson on our first day. The second salesman we dealt with was difficult to work with, complaining a lot and steering us toward units he was interested in pushing, not ones that interested us. We ended up purchasing a trailer from Blue Dig RV because they listened and tried to meet our needs."
4.5,2,"I'm very disappointed with the service provided from Johnny Walker rv. After purchasing a 2018 Road warrior in March and returning back in June to have some warranty work done only to wait over 4 weeks and repairs not done when I went to pick up trailer. I was told twice in that time to come and pick up the trailer and use it until the parts came in. Being a hundred miles away it was a chore to move a 44' trailer back and forth so I opted to leave it at the dealer in Las Vegas. I was told it would take two weeks for a new awning to com in and 3 hours to install. After calling today to find out the status I was told awning wouldn't be in til the 18th( almost 3 weeks instead of 2 as told). When all repairs are done the dealer will have had the trailer longer than me. Poor service for a $90,000 vehicle."
4.5,5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you JWRV for servicing our 5th wheel in such a timely and professional manner. We had resigned ourselves to the hell known as Camping World and you all took the time to make sure that we were satisfied. You put the customer first, something that other RV businesses sorely lack."
4.5,1,HORRIBLE! They are an authorized Jayco dealer for motorhomes but refuse to do warranty work on our brand new Jayco. WHY? Because we didn't buy it from them! We gave them last look to provide a reasonable price before we bought it elsewhere and they would not go within a reasonable range of the price elsewhere. We bought our motorhome for well over $40k less than they had theirs listed. Now they are refusing to do warranty work and are an authorized dealer for Jayco. Look elsewhere people -- you can get a MUCH BETTER deal! I'd give zero stars if I could.
4.5,5,"Both sales and service here are top notch.  Bought our first ever travel trailer here in 2013. The salesman was super informative and helpful, and really seemed to care more about our needs and comfort than in closing a sale. Lots of advice on matching the trailer to my tow vehicle (2011 Xterra), and went with me on a test tow after installing the load distributing hitch to make sure I was comfortable with the towing before we actually bought the trailer. 
I did also shop at some other dealers before the final purchase, and the interactions with the sales guys there help close the deal with Johnnie Walker for me. There was just no comparison in the level of knowledge and care.
Had a couple of minor warranty issues with the trailer, and the service department was as good as sales, fixing the items promptly and with no fuss. 
I'm ready to upgrade now, but I live in Oregon.  After reading the reviews of the local places, I'm seriously considering driving back to Las Vegas for the trade!"
4.5,5,"Wow, how refreshing is it to find a business that does what they say they are going to do. After reviewing ratings for local Las Vegas RV service business's and getting a few recommendations from neighbors I brought in a recently purchased 40' Motorhome with a laundry list of issues. Chris in the service department patiently went through my list and off I went. He called me periodically to update me on progress, and to get my approval for various things. The prices for labor and material were reasonable and everything was repaired as I hoped for. Quality parts, quality technicians, and honesty was what I was impressed with. Chris, a former technician himself, was awesome, and strived to keep me in the loop and made great recommendations. These folks are deserving of your business. Couldn't be happier!"
4.5,5,JW is the place to go for RVs. Great service and tons of options on site. I don't hesitate to come here when I need services done. Good place with good people not many places like that.
4.5,5,"Johnnie Walker RV is awesome! They are a wonderful family owned business with the friendliest staff. They aren't out to sell the biggest and most expensive all the time, they  will tell you what is best for you and your family after you explain exactly what you are looking for! I can't stand pushy salesmen & they are very patient and respectful of your decision. I will be back to JW for any RV needs we have!"
4.5,1,You be the judge - $980 for 4 backing plates and 2 drums. $600 to replace one waste tank slide valve. 7 days. I think that's about $500 too high
4.5,5,"I bought my used Rv from Shawna last year. She was extremely helpful and answered my 1001 questions. I am totally new to the world of RVs and it was a huge decision to make. I thought RVing was only for retirement. Was I wrong! We love going out and exploring everything Nevada and our neighbors have to offer... Being new to the RV world a big shout out to Danny in the service dept. I have had a few trial and error runs over the last few trips out. Operator error on my end but Danny is always there to answer any questions and take the time to show me how things work. ( over and over) Im glad I got the warranty for as long as possible. It has already come in handy once so thanks Leann for advising us what plan would be best. 

Im so happy I choose to look at Johnnie Walker we almost bought a new one with half the equipment for a higher price at Findlay Rv. Nothing against those guys but the service at Johnnie Walker has been OUTSTANDING! Shawna our saleslady even called us months after our purchase to give us an extra cushion that the original owner dropped off. Now thats caring and making ya feel like family!! 

One last note on service Do NOT take your RV to CAMPING WORLD they are a total rip off! They charged me 25 bucks to simply add air in my tires!! I will only let the guys at JW touch my Rv from now on."
4.5,5,"Just finished our first boondocking adventure and thought I would take my time to write a review on the place that made this all possible.  

We absolutely love Johnnie Walker.  My fiancé and I began looking for our toy hauler last summer and we went from place to place looking for the best one.  Unfortunately our options were limited due to the size (height) of our toy and the overall weight of the toy hauler itself.  We finally met our sales person, Gina and she was attentive and patient, as we explained exactly what we were looking for.  Gina provided us timely communication of different options as they became available.  While we initially went in for a used toy hauler, we ended up buying a brand new one, which really made me happy. 

Once we made our purchase, Chase was helpful as we did our inspection walk through.  He answered all of our questions and even did some demonstrations while we recorded them in preparation for our first trip.  Absolutely incredible!

I highly recommend Johnnie Walker's to anyone considering buying an RV.  Their service is top notch and unmatched from other places we visited along the way."
4.5,5,This is the place to get an RV/travel trailer. They are honest good people. Service is great and they always make good on their warranties. You will walk out feeling good about your situation when you go here. Even if you're just looking at options. This is one of the few places in town where I was actually greeted with a smile as I walked through the door. I wasn't even acknowledged at other places.
4.5,1,"Way way overpriced, Staff didn't know if they were coming or going. i had bought a solar panel off amazon and noticed they had the same one only $450 more for exact same fold up panel."
4.5,5,My first RV .Heard great things about Johnnie Walker RV by all my neighbors .I was Greeted by Christine Duchesne Who was so patient with my wife and I and showed all all the RV'S explained all the features without any pressure. So very knowledgeable and professional we purchased without any hesitation. After they did the paperwork are new RV was completely detailed and a Very nice service technician Alan explained in detail how to operate the RV.We also dealt with Kurt in the parts department. The whole Johnnie Walker service team was outstanding.
4.5,5,"I will only let Johnnie Walkers crew get my business! 
They have worked on all my RVs for over 15 years. 
 -The service writers are patient and will go out of there way to help you.   
 -The technicians know there stuff and have fixed everything I have brought there way. 
 -The sales group are no pressure and will ensure you get the right RV. 
 -Parts department is knowledgeable and helpful.
 I had an RV with structural problems and the manufacture had gone out of business. These guys got if fixed and stood behind there warranty.  You won't be disappointed."
4.5,1,"Bought my travel trailer from them and had a positive experience so I thought that I'd use them when my vehicle needed some work on my 7-pin connector for the used truck I just bought (my brake controller and my turn signals were not working on trailer when I connected it...but my running lights were working).  I made an appointment several days out and was advised to show up between 0700-0730 to ensure I'd be the first one worked on and back out the door in a timely manner (the guy I spoke to was confident the connector needed replaced or that there was a fuse issue...quick fix).

So, I showed up at 0701 and no one was there.  There was a guy in the shop that told me the service guys get there at 0730.  Well that's just great...why did he tell me 0700?  At 0720, Chris came out of the office and took my information.  I advised him that I don't have a ride out of there so I would stick around and wait - if it was just the connector or a fuse, it would be quick anyway - right?

At 0745, I went out with a guy in the parts department to see if a quick link would fit on my receiver...truck hadn't moved.  At 0820, I went out on my own and found the same thing...truck hadn't moved.  They had set the expectation that my truck would be taken in right away at 0700 and that it would be quick (if it was just the connector or fuses) so I planned on being gone by 0800-0815 and on my way to work.  But here it was 0820 and my truck hadn't even moved?  

I had to get to work so I went back into the service office and advised the guys there (Chris was no longer there and a big guy named Ryan was) that I was told to be there at 0700 and my truck had not moved - and that I needed to get to work.  I politely asked for my key so that I could be on my way.  Ryan was very smug in his response that he didn't know where Chris was.  He eventually got up to go look for him and was gone about 5 minutes.  When he finally got back he said he couldn't find him and that I couldn't have my key.  I told him that I had the spare in my pocket and would use that one and would be on my way and when they located my key, they could get it back to me.

This guy FOLLOWED ME OUT OF THE OFFICE and was berating me, harassing me, and spoke insultingly and condescendingly to me.  He did see a service tech who had my key as we walked and he told him to give it to me.  But it wasn't until I lowered myself to his level and responded to him with the same tone that he was giving me that he finally left me alone and went back into the office (along with some adult language, I'll admit that).

Eventually went to 4 the Truck Customs & Accessories and the guy came out to look at my truck and immediately told me that my connector was from Ford and that it was plug and play...told me to go to Ford and get a replacement.  Then he checked a couple fuses and told me which one was bad and then noticed that my brake controller was not even plugged in...he plugged it in and it worked fine!  This guy took 5 minutes and solved all my problems and didn't charge me a dime...while Johnny Walker RV had me waiting well past an hour and hadn't even looked at my truck and were prepared to charge me $140/hr for their tech's time.

Terrible, terrible experience and I won't return except for warranty work on my RV.

And please do not confuse this review with a review of my purchasing experience.  My purchase experience was positive and I would recommend them for that.  But their guys in the service department need to learn a lot about setting/managing expectations as well as general customer service...being followed out to my car by the guy with him berating me as we walked...UNACCEPTABLE!"
4.5,5,"After being treated poorly at another RV dealer in Las Vegas I have learned my lesson. Johnnie Walker RV has the best staff and has earned my business. No pushy salesmen and no hidden costs. Great selection and great prices. Cutter was a delight to work with. Family owned and family values, Hats off to Johnnie Walker RV!"
4.5,5,"I have a crazy situation, I bought a 5th wheel a few weeks ago from Clean Cut Running for Office Steve and Big Joe. They gave me an awesome price below the true value and America First quickly and easily financed me. Well, I took her out for her maiden voyage and have come to the conclusion that I will need something a little bigger. Steve and Joe told me to take the Trailer back to them and they will get me into what I need! Pretty awesome! I havent even registered yet. They have made me feel comfortable as they are actively looking for another trailer. Today I even received a post card in the mail from them with the message "" Dont stress about the 5th wheel! We will get you into something you love!"" I cant begin to say how thankful I am to the crew at Johnnie Walker! I will keep you guys updated!"
4.5,2,"I was told that  Johnnie Walker was the best place to go.  But now I wish I had  gone some  where else.  They gave me a warranty so of course, I  thought everything with the  coach was  going to be  ok.  Well that's not what happen.  I took it to  a Cat dealer at 1st  and the warranty wasn't  going to covering  anything. Then we found out that the cool air charger wasn't working and thankfully they would cover  that,  but  would  not cover the radiator. I  bought  this RV in April 2015. Yes, it was a used  coach. I  should of taken it and had someone  check  it  out, before purchasing.  Now we have to take it in yet again, this time for electrical  problems  and the toilet is leaking.  I hope that this under warranty.  I just hope it is covered.  (I  hate  writing a bad reviews)  The sales  person was great and Warranty person  was great.  I just wish  Johnnie Walker  would of helped with the  radiator.   I heard  Finnally RV helped someone  that brought a used coach from them when  they founded out they sold a bad coach.  Our part of the  bill was $5400.   All  I wanted them to do is help with the radiator.   But they said no.  So I am now taking everything off my  coach  that says  Johnnie Walker.  And I have some friends  that where on there way down.  Now there  thinking  twice."
4.5,5,Great service department! We had a difficult install on our motor home backup camera. Jeramy and Al went out of their way to do get the job done. They contacted the original manufacturer on our behalf to get the correct part. We will be returning.
4.5,5,"Dustin, has been one of the most helpful people I've met at Johnnie Walkers. He assisted me by discussing options I had regarding trading our TT in. He was a wealth of knowledge, very kind, and extremely patient. I hope when raises are handed out, he receives one. Thank you so much Dustin. It's been a pleasure to meet you and receive such tremendous assistance."
4.5,5,"I went to get some info on used diesel motor homes. I met Jim Cutler ""The best"" salesman I've ever dealt with. Jim took the time to listen and even though my time frame is about a month away Jim Cutler took the time to explain the difference between a ""diesel pusher"" and a ""gas puller"". I'm going to get my next RV from Jim. Wow what a nice and knowledgeable guy. Not pushy!! Thanks Jim, see you soon!"
4.5,5,"We bought a used toy hauler from a private seller. We couldn't seem to find one we liked from your lot. First time out we found a lot of problems with it. I fixed what I could, but a few things like generator and electrical problems I didn't have the full knowledge to do on my own work on the genny. They still helped me even though I ended up not buying from them. Great place and always helpful and knowledgeable about Rv's. I will now buy parts or let them work on my Rv."
4.5,5,"So....I don't usually do reviews. Very few places make me feel like a review is deserved. Every person was amazeballs!!! They treated us so great, and even tried to entertain my L.O. They didn't try to B.S. us, or sell us on something we didn't want. We looked at the ones we really wanted to look at. Zack and Ryan took care of us. Both were great and personable. All our questions were answered. I feel like their prices here are reasonable compared to many other RV lots. Again, they were not pushy!! In fact, I personally felt very comfortable there, including the times my son got all crazy like a little sour patch kid. No one complained. The lots where they keep the RV's are kept up nicely, as well as inside the dealership/business center. Clean establishment over all. Again, all the people I personally came in contact with, including my son, were super nice and happy easy going people! We enjoyed our experience there!! Thanks y'all for being awesome!!"
4.5,5,"Great people. They fixed my hot water tank. And have ordered parts for the refrigerator

As usual, they were professional and very helpful."
4.5,4,"My hat is off to JW. I took my Monaco in for service and unfortunately, they backed it into a light pole shattering the fiberglass. They quickly informed me of the accident and immediately started the repairs and paint. Unfortunately, they did not check the bedroom wall on the inside so I returned it right away. They tried to match the paneling as close as possible. I approved the panel closest to the original one. It took another three weeks to receive the panels and do the repairs.
It was an unfortunate incident but I commend Cole for working through the dilemma in a professional manner. Ken was completely understanding as well and very helpful.
In spite of the terrible circumstances and time frame it is now returned and in very good condition. 

In spite of this unfortunate event JW is still the only place I will have work done on my coach."
4.5,5,"Johnnie Walker RV has three locations.  My recent service took place both at this locations and the one on 3700 Boulder Highway.  Ken Allen (Service Manager) and his team went out of their way to accommodate my schedule and to do some custom work on the new motorhome.  I'm not the easiest person to please and they blew me away with their knowledge and amazing customer service.  

They had to do a lot of extra work internally to take care of my two projects but made everything seamless.  Both projects required a good amount of skill and a willingness to take them on.  I will use Johnny Walker RV for all of my motorhome work and would not think of taking it anywhere else except for an emergency and for the work they will not perform such as the chassis.  It is easy to see my so many people personally recommended Johnnie Walker RV to me when looking for a motorhome and a place to service it."
4.5,5,"When you go to but an Rv ask for Jared he's a super great guy and was very knowledgeable about the things I needed to know about my home property before we got to deep into looking which was great because I didn't even think about height when I was looking. Jared took the time to show me 5 Rvs and he knew everything about each one.
My biggest fear was that buying an Rv was going g to be like buying a car and the high pressure sales that happen when you do, but this was not the case I told Jared what I had to have to make the deal and he said OK and went above and beyond. 
All in all this was a great experience for my wife and I and we are super happy with the choice we made 

Thaks guys"
4.5,5,"Took my newly purchased (private party) trailer into them for some minor service, basically just to check it out.  Chris was my service rep and Manuel was one of the techs I talked with as well.  This was by far the best automotive/boat/RV related service I have ever gotten in Vegas.  A true breath of fresh air.  Kept me in the loop and the prices were very reasonable.  I would recommend them to anyone!"
4.5,5,"I just want to say as one of the Walker's at Johnnie Walker RV's that it is extremely frustrating when customers use social media/review sites as a blackmail or ""hold you hostage"" site to get something for free. I am amazed at the emails that I receive that say if we don't do this or that, or give a customer financial reimbursement that they are going to place bad reviews all over the internet. It is sad for the good, honest companies out there. We have been in business for 53+ years helping families have fun RVing, and to see this happening in society via internet is sad. The call/email/review with untrue information and a dealer can do nothing about it unless we want to pay their ""ransom"". They say ""give us this, give us that or give us money, and we will remove the review"" - this is not acceptable. You can see reviews all over different sites that state we do a great job, please don't let a handful of poor reviews sway your opinion. Remember there are ALWAYS 2 sides to every story.

Just want you all to know that yes all RV's have service issues on occasion, as they are basically houses on wheels and we will always be here to make the repairs!"
4.5,5,"This place was fantastic! The sales gal Angela was the absolute best! She was not pushy non of the folks at this place were. She's kind honest, and I would come back from San Francisco to do business with this place again, and Angela as well. I can't say enough about Jonny Walker R.V. I recommend them highly!"
4.5,5,"Ryan, Ken, and all of the guys in the service department are top notch.  Ive had a to make a,couple visits recently for repairs as well as some warranty work, and they have worked with me on scheduling.  I live in my RV full time so getting in on days when I'm moving to a different place is important, and having it in the shop for the last amount of time is key.  They understand this is my home and always do their best to have me in and out in the same day.  The work requested is always completed, and done at a high level of quality.  Dusty in the Parts Dept is always very helpful and has great suggestions when I have questions or issues."
4.5,1,"These people are CROOKS. Paid cash for a 2018 White Water on October 22nd 2017 and it has not worked properly 100% of the time, with 6 failed attempts to fix by Jonnie Walker RV. Have been given the run around with Service as far as documenting our attempts to fix and service complaints correctly. This will be an evolving and updated review, documenting our account to resolution.
I would also like to address Darcy's comment (recently removed) about how her dealership is ""held hostage"" through customers vocalizing their experience. My wife and I paid cash, in full and the coach has a bad water heater / gas system / circuit board recall. After two months of problems and 6 attempts to fix the issues our trailer is having, she has the nerve to say ""when you buy a new trailer, you have to expect that all brand new trailers will need repairs right when you get it"".  Our unresolved repairs consist of the major systems that make a trailer functional, like the water heater and gas system. Our 2018 TT has been parted out, had entire systems replaced and has a recall circuit board. However, we are expected to continue the insanity and to let them make even more attempts to fix it (how does one fix a recall?). As a consumer. We have a right to expect that our BRAND NEW 2018 TT functions properly and safely. If ANYONE is being held hostage, it is us! I am quite positive you cashed our check for over 27k. 
I have even had my insurance company deny coverage because of its non functional status. 
In the long run it seems this company's scam is to sell RV's and hope that people drive away have things break down on the road and become some one else's problem. I lost count of how many times Darcy told us we could have our trailer serviced elsewhere. 
The sales experience was simple. We came in with an idea of what we wanted after a lot of searching. As soon as our sales person handed us off things went down hill fast. Our trailer arrived Friday and we were set up in the overnight lot to camp and have the ""Jonnie Walker Schooling"" or whatever! We had a 10-15m walk through of the trailer and didn't see any service person again until Monday afternoon at 4pm. We had to chase people to fix things and make minor repairs from delivery. After finally being delivered to our destination (a day an a half late) things got even worse! The driver rolled our driver side jack when he dropped the trailer off (later was replaced under warranty). From there the issues snowball. With a long list from bad propane tanks, temperature and pressure valve failure, LP Regulator swap out, Water heater replacement, un burned propane smell inside the cabin....the list goes. The service department has had it on the lot twice, and has made 6 attempts to rectify the issues. This establishment proudly sells LEMONS and will NOT help you when your trailer becomes unsafe for general use. They rely on the hope that you will not take any legal action against them. I have every intention of letting my lawyer, the entire Vegas Valley, and my entire social network know the truth of the Walker Family business. Stay tuned for more..."
4.5,5,"In November, we purchased our very first trailer and it was from Johnnie Walker.  We are residents of California but decided to buy from Johnnie Walker because the communications and pre-sale service gave us greater confidence.  We could not be more happy with our purchase or with the team at Johnnie Walker.  There were a couple issues from the factory that Johnnie Walker addressed on their own and without hesitation.  That was very impressive.  I would not hesitate to go out of state again or to recommend anyone to Johnnie Walker.  It was and continues to be a great experience, especially for newbies like us!"
4.5,5,"I will always do my rv business with Johnny Walker RV !!!
I do alot of procrastinating but finally purchased my new toyhauler from them.
The best buying experience I have went through ever period.
Tom in sales took care of his part no pressure and got me where I needed to be . Finance found me the rate I wanted 
And Leeann handled the paperwork smooth and got me a better rate on insurance than my insurer.
There were some hick ups with pdi and 
Issues with trailer upon delivery but Ken Allen the service manager stepped in and has handled everything so far as promised.
I can't say enough about Ken but he is a man of his word , you don't find that much anymore. 
This is the first review I have ever done but I felt a need to let people know that with Zthis major purchase and on going service that will be needed this is the place to go. You will be taken care of well, that's probably why they have been in business for so long!!
Walker family you have a heck of a crew representing you,  job well done. 

Sincerely,

Patrick Forbes  2017 Stealth WA 2916"
4.5,5,"We purchased our 5th wheel from JW about a year ago and recently had it inspected and repaired after our first long road trip. These guys never disappoint - such a great sense of customer service!!! Got all our minor issued fixed within a couple of days. Everybody is really nice and friendly there, Braden and Cole in service department are really helpful and professional. It is a great company to deal with, we are really glad we chose to buy our rig from Johnnie Walker!!!"
4.5,1,This place is horrible and mismanaged. Darcy is a poor excuse for an employee. Her attitude alone is the reason why Johnny Walker couldn't sell my RV. She cursed at my fiancee and I both dropping multiple F bombs. Why would anyone want to do business here??????
4.5,5,"We bought our Jayco travel trailer at Johnnie Walker a few months ago. We are very happy with our purchase. We got a great deal on the travel trailer! Our salesperson, Tom Alford has been outstanding! We are new to RV'ing and he answered all of our questions and offered all the info we needed to get started. He even went WAY above and beyond and got us a beautiful bedding set for our trailer for free - months after the sale!! We shopped around for a long time before we bought and did tons of research. We are so happy that we ended up buying from Johnnie Walker. We wouldn't go anywhere else for future RV's and service! Do yourself a favor and skip the other dealers and just go to Johnnie Walker."
4.5,5,"I can say without reservation that Johnnie Walker RV is the best service center I have ever been to.  I started RVing in 2005 and bought a new RV in 2010.  The first day we had the new RV we were hit on the freeway.  After the terrible repair job by Camping World (Las Vegas), the main slide never worked correctly.  The slide has been ""repaired"" by several dealers and RV service centers in 3 different States.  The slide never worked right.  When we were in Las Vegas, we decided to take the RV in to Johnnie Walker RV and see if they could fix it.  Ed (Service Writer) was the best. The slide was fixed correctly and still operates perfectly to this day.  He also knew what was wrong with my emergency brake and fixed that in about 1/2 hour.  Amazing service, honest service, and remarkably fast.  Because of my experience at Johnnie Walker RV and Ed's extremely caring attitude, we are now loyal customers.  This is ABSOLUTELY the best dealership I have EVER been to.  Thanks JWRV!"
4.5,5,"Linda and I special ordered a new 2019 Jayco Hummingbird 17RK Travel Trailer from Johnie Walker RV. Christina Duchesne made the sales part very easy and stream line and exceed our expectations in purchasing a tow-able RV. We had a timeline that we needed the RV by and to be fair it was not a realistic timeline. But Christina made it happen anyway and even got it to us a week earlier then expected. We are ecstatic with our experience with Johnie Walker RV 

Also Kieth from the service team was our walk thru guy on how our new RV worked and how to use it to the fullest. A very nice and easy to talk to gentlemen. He fielded all our questions with ease and we feel totally comfortable driving away with our RV knowing we can call on him anytime with questions."
4.5,5,"My sales man Troy went out of his way to find me help what I wanted. If you decide to buy an RV from Johnnie Walker my honest opinion is you could not go wrong by specifically asking for Troy.
Everybody went out of there way to make sure I was served well. Go see the guys at Johnnie Walker RV to buy your next RV"
4.5,5,"I've been in sales for a little over 10 years now and I have to say that Johnnie Walker RV is not what I've ever experienced in the past. The entire process was simple from beginning to end and continues to be a great experience. The entire staff is very welcoming, they treated us like we were part of their family. Thank you Mark (sales), Alan (service), Mike (service), Danny (service), Pat (sales) and LeeAnn (finance). We even got to meet Johnnie Walker himself. He gave us apples from his tree in Utah.

If you ever walked on any RV dealership, you will see & feel the difference here."
4.5,1,"Thank you for your reply JWRV but it's an excuse only. A friend just had their RV in your shop - that they did not buy from you - but it was out of warranty and they were taken right in. Making excuses for your poor customer service and threatening sales tactics does not fix this. Your service department also said ""we will not do warranty repairs because you did not buy it here"". That's quite the customer service message! We've already been in touch with media and Jayco."
4.5,5,"I had some work done on my RV by Johnie Walker RV, and I have never been more satisfied with any service provider. They gave me a reasonable quote for the body work I needed and stuck to the estimate exactly and even included some extra things that they found and didn't charge me for. I left it for several days and they even plugged it in overnight so that the refrigerator was sure to work. The service people, Al, Ed and Jeremy obviously love their jobs and make it a fun place to visit. 
I cannot speak highly enough about this shop. Although I don't live in Las Vegas, I would definitely drive some distance to return there if I need more service in the future."
2,1,I reserved an RV site two months before my arrival. I called saying I will be arriving after 7 PM. I was assigned an RV space and had a cargo trailer and travel trailer in it. I called several times and no one return my calls. I asked their reservation company to give me my money back and they did. Don't go there.
2,1,"The management is awesome. Super nice people.  A little cautious of electricity issues... Faulty ground... People seem a little stretchy but they aren't... and coupe little issues besides that if they fixed that and updated thier facilities a bit, this place could be amazing."
2,4,Eddie is very helpful. I stop here a few times a week to top off my propane and water.
2,1,Worse RV park ever. They said they had lots of spots available and we could just come in and take a spot when we got there were hardly any spots.  The woman inside said they only took RVs 92 or newer (we had a 2002) we said that's fine. When we got inside the park it didn't look like any of the RVs were newer then 92. They also charged $3 for our pet but did not provide any kind of a pet area not even a sand area. Horrible RV park. So not stop here!
4.5,5,"Boulder Boats is the best dealer around.  They go above and beyond in every way, to take care of their customers.  They treat everyone like family.  I've purchased 2 boats from them, and the process was fantastic.  Five stars aren't enough."
4.5,5,"We had a wonderful experience with the staff at Boulder Boats. We found the perfect boat for our family and they were really friendly and answered all of our questions for us. They made our boat purchase very easy and we would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to buy their dream boat! 
Thanks again to David and Kirk and the whole Boulder Boats crew!!!"
4.5,5,"Everyone there is amazing and friendly. From the reception to finance to service to sales and even the GM, they're all great. We had a blast with Kurt test driving our Advantage Party Cat and Dave was awesome in the sales department. Seriously, if you're looking to buy a boat, don't waste your time going anywhere else."
4.5,1,"This company nearly ran my family off the road. If they are not courteous drivers one will only assume they do the same with their business. Was coming on to the 95 and the right lane was backed up. We literally had no where to go. What kind of business drives around like that and does that to a family with a toddler in the car. What a way to represent your business. Courtesous driving goes a long way, now you know."
4.5,5,Boulder boats has amazing staff that are very helpful and nice. I definitely would recommend checking out the shop and all that they have!! The kids could also enjoy the mini basketball court and kids area. Great place to go!!!
4.5,5,"I needed some wake sacks and wanted to buy them in town so I could compare and contrast brands. Reiner and the people in parts were MORE than helpful. They walked me thru the different types and sizes and got me set up for a perfect surf wave on a 2005 vlx. While we were there we got a tour of the new MXZ22! What an AMAZING BOAT! And even though we were in our work clothes (basketball shorts and a tank top) they still showed us the same respect and attention as someone walking in in a three pc suit!The knowledge of the  sales and parts staff are second to NONE! Check them out! You won't be disappointed! Thanks again guys!

In addition to that apparently I left my company credit card in the machine. They actually REACHED OUT TO ME and left me a message letting me know it's in a safe place until I come back for it!"
4.5,3,"Yesterday I dropped off my boat after having difficulty with another shop. I will update this after I get my boat back, but until then I can only speak to my experience so far. 
On the phone everyone at Boulder boats has been friendly and informative. Marty checked in my boat, it's obvious the man knows his job and is very professional. Their prices are fair and I didn't get the feeling I was going to be ""taken for a ride"", in fact I feel like professionals will repair my boat for a fair price. I hope that feeling is confirmed when I see their work and the bill. 

****update****
At this point I'm not sure if I will return to this place. One thing is for sure if I do it will not be during the spring or any other time they are busy. I was told I beat the busy time barely, yet it took a week to trace a power steering leak for which required only .5 hrs of labor and another week to finish their ""gold star service"". I decided to pick up my boat two days after the leak was located. At that point they couldn't even tell me if they had the replacement part in stock much less finish the repair. I do not blame Marty, he was clearly working his tail off. But, I would offer a word of caution to anyone that considers taking their boat in for service during a busy time."
4.5,5,"My husband and I traveled from the Bay Area to Boulder Boats to purchase a 23' Baja Open Bow, the boat of our dreams. The boat was serviced, detailed, water tested and ready for it's new owners.  I had forgotten the kind of service you get at Boulder Boats even existed anymore. The staff is knowledgeable,friendly and very helpful, they know you by name. From start to finish our experience was amazing. Lucas was our salesman and in working with him we made a friend.    We had some issues since we lived so far from Henderson, and decided to pick up the boat ourselves.  Boulder Boats went above and beyond what would be expected to support and help us. They stood behind there customer satisfaction statement.  We will be looking for an additional boat in the future, we will look to Boulder Boats for that purchase. Thank you to everyone at Boulder Boats for the good old fashioned customer service and really caring.  Carole K."
4.5,5,"I just made my very first boat purchase.  Not knowing where to start, I first went to Boulder Boats where I found Neil to be a wealth of exactly the information I needed to know what I wanted to buy for my family.

A month later, I continued to shop but found myself back at Boulder Boats for my purchase due to the quality of customer service from Neil.

The more amazing part, after making my purchase, is that their ongoing support and customer service has been equally as great after my purchase which is so unusual these days.  This included taking us to the lake for training as well as other service items related to the new purchase.

No regrets here and would highly recommend this business.  They know how to treat their customers."
4.5,5,Just bought my new axis and I love it!  Lucas was fantastic! Very knowledgeable and helpful through the process.  He made the buying experience very quick and easy. Ben was also very helpful and took the time to answer many of my questions and help me choose  the best options for my boat. Thanks guys! It's gonna be a great summer thanks to all of you!
4.5,2,"Such High Hopes when I contacted Boulder Boats...

Should've been easy- ended up being a long and drawn out process (despite a 760+ Credit Score and 10% Cash Down) and we inevitably ended up buying down the Street.

Initially called about a Boat seen on Boat Trader- come to find out that almost everything they have on there has been Sold for months and they ""leave the ADs up to draw people in"".

Ended up finding a Boat that would work for us that they had in AZ (we are in Vegas).  I was impressed with their Demo Process, their knowledge of everything Marine, and the ease of applying for Financing, however...  after waiting over a week to get everything done, we were told that the Boat was on consignment, and we would have to either fly out to AZ to demo the Boat, or Sign all of the Docs without ever seeing the Boat in person because it ""can't leave the State until it's paid for in full on a Consignment Deal.

The fact that they don't Own the Boat, and are just selling it for someone else, should've have been disclosed at the very beginning of any conversation about buying it, and/or Selling me on the Demo Process.

After expanding our search, and Buying an amazing Boat down the Street (which only took 3 Days to get home), we realized that every Boat we were looking at with Boulder Boats was priced way over the NADA Value, which is why we couldn't get a decent deal while financing.  Every Boat we inquired about, came back at 80-85% to Loan ratio, which meant the Bank valued each Vessel at 15-20% less than the Dealer was selling them for.

I can say this- Brittany in Finance was Stellar.  So good, that we took the Loan she was able to get for us, and brought it to another Dealership, for a different Boat.  She was so helpful, that we wanted to stay with her despite the issues we were having with their Sales Team, but just couldn't find the right deal with them.

Having dealt with Boulder Boats, and a Competitor down the street within the same 2 weeks- my Family and I feel we've experienced both ends of the Spectrum.  I hate to say it, because it's ""BOULDER BOOOOOATS""...  but the experience we had with them was frustrating, and nothing more than a waste of time...."
4.5,2,"Update: Response to Dealer Response.
Though I appreciate you trying to clean this all up after the fact, I didn't respond to you privately because I felt it was unnecessary.

First of all, despite all of our issues and concerns throughout the Buying Process with your Dealership, we never heard from you, nor had we ever even heard your name until this Review was posted.  Where were you while you're Team was feeding us a bunch of false information?  It would have been nice to hear from you when I was upset that we were sold on a Boat you didn't own, and the Demo process that wasn't possible because the Boat was in AZ!

Secondly, your Finance Team is the one that suggested that one of us drop off of the App for the chance of a better rate and less money down.  We did so, per the advice of your Finance Team.  And yes, we did take our Loan somewhere else, per the advice of the Lender that you worked ""so diligently"" to obtain.  America First Credit Union advised me to take my deal somewhere else, because I was going to be spending $34.k on $17.k Vessel.  And for the record- they were able to put myself and my co-signer on the Loan after I went down to the Bank myself and took things into my own hands.

With regard to your ""Skin in the Game"" comment- is that a Financial Term?  I find it strange that you call it one thing, and the Lender you worked ""so diligently"" to find for us calls it something else.  For the sake of understanding, I'll use your terminology....
""Skin in the Game"", for the Bank, would be loaning me money to buy a boat, that's actually worth the amount they're loaning out- or in my current case, loaning me money for a vessel that's worth more than what they loaned out.  It was the Lender that advised that the reason they needed so much money down, was because they didn't value the vessel at what you did, and we had to close the gap with more cash.

Again- I appreciate your effort in trying to clean this up, but please don't waste your time trying to manipulate, twist and contort the situation on my Post.

4.5,5,Amazing customer service and well worth the 1700 mile round trip drive. Lucas and Stewart.. Thank you for the amazing customer service. The entire staff was amazing.
4.5,5,Very professional and knowledgeable staff and an amazing selection of high end boats. The sales people were not pushy at all.
4.5,5,"I want to HIGHLY recommend Boulder Boats to anyone considering purchasing a boat.  My wife and I are relatively new to boating.  We bought a small Yamaha jet boat last summer, and loved it.  Then we tried surfing on a friend's boat, and decided to upgrade.  After considering the different options, we felt the Axis line of boats (built by Malibu) represented the best value for us - lots of wake, lots of room, great handling, great ergonomics, and best value for our money.

We began by talking with the General Manager, Mark.  He took a great deal of time to talk to us about what boat might fit our needs, what boats wouldn't (and why), and how to get the most value for the best price.  He took the time to understand our family's needs and abilities and our intentions about how the boat would get used most of the time (do you really think you'll have 17 people on the boat with you?).  I've been in sales a long time, and Mark comes across as trusted advisor, more than guy trying to close a deal.

He introduced us to Dave Humphries (sales person) and Dave helped us consider the different options, and get out on the lake for a demo.  We ended up settling on the A24, but the A22 and T23 were in the mix, and probably would have been great choices as well.  He offered us a fair price on our trade in, and what we feel is a good price on the new boat.  

Hayden took us out for a demo, and helped us select some ""starter"" gear when we got back to the shop.  He was considerate in recommending low and mid-price gear for our mostly beginner family.  Again here, we didn't feel ""oversold"" in an area where I'm sure their margins are good, and they could have pushed products that would have cost us more, and we might not have realized the benefit of.  Thank you, and well done.

Our thanks to all the team at Boulder Boats.  We had a great experience at every interaction.  We felt that we, our time, and our business, were valued.  We look forward to having them help us service our new boat.  And, if we ever decide to look at new boats again - my wife says we're keeping this one for 10 years ;) - we'll definitely feel comfortable working with them again."
4.5,5,"These guys are so amazing!  Every time we need anything in service they do all they can to squeeze us in and are so nice. We were headed to Powell and stopped there and discovered that they have a great selection of accessories for boats so we could get everything we needed. Holly is a gem and they make you feel like a VIP every time you go in by doing the little things, like putting your cover on, checking your straps before it's towed, getting the boat ready for pickup while you're checking out. Just awesome service!"
4.5,1,"I brought my boat in three weeks ago for a detail and summer readiness check. The staff was friendly and seemed to be very helpful. I was told it would take a while because this is the busiest time of year with people getting ready for boating season. This wasnt a problem because I was not in a huge hurry. 

I was informed after the first week that my detail was complete and there were some issues with my trailer brakes. I authorized the repair. More issues were found, I authorized more repairs. Understandable, the boat isnt brand new so problems arrive. I was told it would be ready Tuesday, it wasn't. I was told it would be ready Wednesday, it wasn't and so on until Saturday. It was supposed to be finished Saturday morning, it wasn't. I finally received a call at 4:30 in the afternoon that my boat was finally ready. 

I paid and went out to get my boat and I see that the cover is not on my boat. I climb up on the trailer and my boat is FILTHY. The boat was 10X dirtier that when I dropped it off. My boat is not new but it has not spent 1 night of its life outside without a cover on it. Then I find out that it has been sitting outside with no cover on it for the past THREE WEEKS. This was upsetting to being with but the initial reason I brought my boat in was to get it detailed and now it is COVERED in dirt on the inside. I mean literally COVERED in dirt. We had a light rain and dirt storm this week and these people didnt think to put the cover on my boat. 

I am extremely disappointed, frustrated and enraged that a ""BOAT DEALERSHIP"" wouldn't take the time to put a boat cover on a boat that just had a $415 detail done to it. 

This was my first dealing with Boulder Boats and honestly, I do not plan to go back and I would not recommend service from them. I cannot believe they would not take care of someone's property and had absolutely no respect for my boat."
4.5,5,Very friendly staff and wonderful building to look and purchase boat gear and boats! Met new friends during the Malibu Rider Experience and looking forward to going out on the lake again soon! Thanks to Boulder Boats for putting together a wonderful event :)
4.5,5,Boulder Boats is awesome and so is their entire staff! From David is Sales to Brittanie in Finance and JT at the pro shop and Hayden who took us out to test/demo board. Special thanks to the team that got the boat ready for us in less than 18 hours and we are on the boat!. Great service and great people! Thanks so much... we love our boat!!!
4.5,2,"Purchased a consigned boat, 10 years old, with many working parts, so it is understandable that things will more than likely be less than perfect. That was completely understood on my end going into this nightmare. We drove 5 hrs to our appointment (arranged in plenty of time) for the lake test on the boat. Upon arrival, John and Kirk were both arguing over who had more work to do than the other and neither wanted to be pulled away by a customer standing right in front of them to perform the lake test. (professional? nope) It was decided that Kirk would help us out, (who in the end is a stud and was apologetic about his/John's little argument). Then we were told there was a problem with the generator, and they were working on it. They knew in plenty of time that we were coming, took my $500 deposit, and had not even brought the boat to their shop from the consignee's house after it had been sitting for months or years to ensure everything was ready for our inspection! We arrived at 9am for our 9:30 appointment, and did not leave the store until around 1pm for the FIRST lake test. 
1st lake test - 25 minutes to the boat ramp, backed boat into the water, boat would not start. Kirk and I looked at everything we knew to check out, no luck. 25 minutes back to BB, mechanics had bumped a connector apart while working on the generator. 2hrs to figure this out and then back out to the lake for test attempt #2.
2nd lake test - 4pm or so we head out, back the boat in the water, boat fires up, I get the thumbs up from Kirk, park the truck, hop on the boat. We get to the no wake boundary and alarms start going off, the motor is over heating! We limp it back to the dock, load up and head back to BB. 
Kirk was outstandingly professional and patient in our presence, I am sure that was not the case with his support staff and the conversations involving this situation. My wife and I were up since 3am, and we were now at 5pm with a 5 hour drive ahead of us and absolutely no confidence in this boat. I can understand these problems, and still wanted the boat, so I explained to John that I would be willing to let them fix everything and would still consider buying if it could pass a lake test FLAWLESSLY. It later did pass and performed fantastic, so I had to deal with the typical sales pitch and haggling BS you get with all salesmen, and we bought the boat and enjoy the heck out of it. 
Moral of the story is, unless you are bringing $200,000 to buy a new boat, DO NOT go here for anything that requires two or more of their departments to perform in tandem. I have no qualms with the mechanics, I am sure they are overloaded and sabotaged by management/sales dept. and are probably very good at what they do. Sales dept. are like all sales people, the finance ladies were great, Kirk was great. Parts dept.? Still not sure on them; I ordered some parts while we were there, about a month ago, was told they would be shipped to me in a week or so, still nothing and no follow up from anyone there."
4.5,5,The best!!! My New Malibu from Boulder Boats has changed my life. I love the boat. BB rocked it for me!!! These guys are awesome. Great go the extra mile for customer service. Five Stars and then some!!
4.5,1,"My experience with boulder boats started off great and the service turned out to be extremely poor quality.  

I was looking for a wakeboard boat at the end of last season so I went down to Boulder Boats to give them an idea of what I was looking for.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  They recommended a 2003 Tige that was fairly priced.  

I purchased the boat and there were quite a few different things wrong with it.  The fuel gauge was broken, oil light stayed on, bimini was cracked, RPM problems, wakeboard racks were loose etc.  Boulder told me to write down the problems I encountered for a week or two then bring it back and they would repair it free of charge.  I had a total of 16 issues that I wrote down and they brought it back to the shop.  This happened to be at the end of last season so I just got a chance to take it back out.  

They literally didn't fix 1 thing!!!! My first ride back out, the RPMs were still sky high and the boat kept almost overheating.  I took my wife wake boarding and within 10 minutes of riding, the wakeboard rack fell off the boat and was a couple feet from smashing into her, the bimini wasn't fixed at all, the fuel gauge is still stuck at full, the oil light is still on, and the worst part:  I took a look at the impeller (a 10 dollar part) and it was completely fried AND HAD NEVER BEEN REPLACED!!! This is the first thing they should have looked at with RPM problems.  I am assuming they wanted it to overheat to get insurance money otherwise putting a new impeller in is a no brainer!!!

Very disappointed overall with my experience.  The boat is a beauty but it costed me 3,000 dollars to get these issues fixed.  I have friends who purchased through Boulder as well that experienced similar issues."
4.5,5,"Yesterday I dropped off my boat after having difficulty with another shop. I will update this after I get my boat back, but until then I can only speak to my experience so far. 
On the phone everyone at Boulder boats has been friendly and informative. Marty checked in my boat, it's obvious the man knows his job and is very professional. Their prices are fair and I didn't get the feeling I was going to be ""taken for a ride"", in fact I feel like professionals will repair my boat for a fair price. I hope that feeling is confirmed when I see their work and the bill."
4.5,5,I have been a customer for years and it keeps getting better.  Kelly in Service is awesome always going the extra step communication is great.  I have bought 2 boats from boulder and is the best decision I have made.  If your looking to deal with honest and just great people go to boulder boats.
4.5,5,"I just wanted to say that I'm very impressed with Boulder Boats.  I'm from Pittsburgh and do not have a phase 5 dealer local.  I was visiting Vegas and looked up Boulder Boats.  From the second we walked in the door we felt welcome there.  Adesa took care of us, Helping us pick out a new board.  She was very knowledgeable and willing to help.  It's nice to walk into a dealership that takes care of there customers, even the one that didn't purchase a boat from them."
4.5,5,"Boulder boats is the GREATEST place to buy a boat.... Save your time and money and look no further than Boulder boats. The friendliest and most knowledgable staff that I have ever seen from any dealer. Their customer service and satisfaction is elite. Also the 10% off boat and sport gear for life after you purchase a watercraft is a plus. Every time I walk in I feel like family which is always a good feeling.
Shout out to David H. for finding us our perfect boat. 
Thanks again to the whole Boulder boats crew for an awesome buying experience...

So yes I would not only recommend buying your boat here but I will be back for my future purchases as well."
4.5,5,"While it's pricey, that's a boat thing.  Gary is a pleasure to work with.  Left our boat her a while, he was super patient."
4.5,5,"Purchased my boat on 5/15/15. Great and friendly customer service, from the IT Guy to Accounting to the Front Desk Lady. My sales representative was John Kozich. John is very knowledgeable and easy to to work with and will treat you right. If you are in the marker for a boat, I highly recommend stopping by Boulder Boats. The auto dealers can really learn a ton about sales and customer service from Boulder Boats."
4.5,5,"I never wanted a boat. Until I did.

I didn't want just a boat, I wanted a pontoon boat. Why? Because Pontoon boats are awesome! What I did not want, was the experience of buying a boat.

Let's go back in time shall we? 3 years ago I was a guy from Los Angeles, driving a supercharged Audi Q7. If you would have asked me what a black tank on an RV was, I would have said, ""the tank that is painted black?"". I knew nothing about camping other than ""glamping"" tents that cost $200/night. How did that guy from 3 years ago end up with a Ram 2500 Cummins, a 40ft 5th wheel and now a pontoon boat? The simple answer is ""a lot of money"". The best answer is people.

I love camping and I love being outdoors. My wife, not so much. But we have three kids and it's all about them, right? The only way I could get my wife to go ""camping"" with us, was to give her a King bed and a private bathroom. So that's what I did. Two and a half years ago I had horrible experiences trying to purchase my first travel trailer. Horrible until I walked into a place called Johnnie Walker RV. I can not say enough positive things about Johnnie Walker RV. If you want a trailer or an RV, do not go anywhere else or you will be sorry. Trust me. But why you ask am I talking about Johnnie Walker RV in a review of Boulder Boats? Because they gave me the referral to Boulder Boats, thankfully. And I love them.

I am not the type of guy that spends 10 months researching pontoon boats. I am able to drill down on what I want after a few hours of internet research. So when I contacted Boulder Boats, I had a very good idea of what I wanted, and the price I wanted to pay. When I called them for the first time and spoke to David, I was very apprehensive. It is never fun dealing with sales people. But David promised that he understood my wants and needs, and he promised there would be no game playing. I am here to say he backed those words up.

Before you purchase a boat, they set you up with an awesome guy named Kirk. He takes you to the lake with the boat you want, and shows you all you need to know about that boat. Cool guy, and he really knows his stuff. He does not like to wear seatbelts in the car, so if you see him, tell him Rod said, PUT ON YOUR SEATBELT MAN!"". You check for any issues, and if you find any, they obviously take care of them. Incredible service? Yep.

A common practice when making a purchase of the size is the old bait and switch. That did not happen here. I explained to David what I wanted, what I wanted to pay, and he emailed me options. 3 days later I owned the boat. Simple as that. You know when you go to buy a car and a 1 hour process turns into 5 hours? That did not happen here. Signing the paperwork took all of 10 minutes. No up-sells, no BS. Just a simple and honest transaction. The way it should be.

I should also mention they have a store. They made sure I had all the required-by-law items for the boat, as well as some extras. I assumed I was paying more purchasing items in that store than what I would pay on Amazon. Surprisingly, when I went home and price matched, I was wrong. In some cases, the items were actually less expensive than what I found online. I spent an hour in the store asking questions, and not once did I feel rushed or that I was bothering them. You can shop in the store knowing you are not getting ripped off.

This was my first boat purchase, and Boulder Boats went above and beyond my expectations. I am not always easy to please, but miraculously they did just that. Are they my Johnnie Walker RV of boats? Only time will tell. But I can say that if I were you, and you are thinking about buying a boat, look no further.

David, Brittanie, Gwen, JT, thanks for all your hard work. Because of you all, I own a boat.

My extended family keeps growing."
4.5,5,Always a great experience! They got me in at the last minute to wi Geroge my boat and had it all done in 2 hrs!
2,3,The sales team is amazing but the guy that did our warranty work failed multiple times. So if your having service done don't let Dennis touch it
2,1,"I brought my motor home to them to repair the cab ac and to do some normal maintenance to the chassis, slide outs, and leveling jacks. Well the result was the cab ac works as long as you are moving, the slide outs had 4 loose screws and no fluid so the first slide out was stuck halfway out on the first night out, and the leveling jacks wouldn't retract the forth night out. All because they had problems that were obvious if they had checked them like they were supposed to. Now I wonder if they even changed the oil."
2,2,"First, the repair shop here is really, really busy. By the numbered tags on each unit, the service department is overwhelmed. However, being busy is a consequence of location.  RVs need service in the fall in a snowbird destination. Busy is not an excuse for rudeness.  ""We didn't sell you your trailer so your [current problem with it] is not our problem."". "" We are not bumping other customers for you"" when I asked for a 10 minute evaluation of how long it would take to repair the problem. We had to get the factory warranty people involved to get help, including help with a potential road hazard. Trailer repaired but the female warranty representative who doesn't much like us claimed to not have a business card and directly refused to give us her last name. That alone speaks volumes for customer care. We are thankful for the intervening factory representatives."
2,1,"42' Gulfstream Tour Master '08
Class A Diesel 400 hp
Made internet service appt. 6 mos in advance and re-confirmed prior to service date on Jan 14, 2015. Our (main) issues- leak inside RV through DR lamp and broken pipe in exhaust system. When we arrived to drop off RV, service manager acknowledged my emails of confirmation but there was no open slot for us, but he 'squeezed us in'. Seriously, what is an appointment if they are really set up for first come first served?! They completed all repairs, including a $500. charge for correcting the slide seals -' reseal top rails both ends, repaired seam tape on both end replace seal on front of slide'. Not a few days away (we are FT) and the slide leaks in same place in heavy rain. The service manager did not respond to my call asking about warranty of work performed and ignored my email request for same. We were already not on great terms when we were told that they were too busy to wash the exterior, regardless that I was willing to pay for it, having asked as part of our work order for both interior and exterior cleaning, due to the exhaust leak leaving extensive soot damage. After spending $3600. on repairs, watching other MH being returned washed gratis, we were most put off. We live in our RV and do not have the luxury of indiscriminate amounts of time to wait for a service that should have been performed, as requested. But to ignore a customer complaint as to a leaking vehicle is arrogant and rude! We had such high hopes for R. Crist and were severely disappointed. When we finally reached our home park in Monument, CO (6/2015) and were able to take our RV to a repair technician, they immediately pointed out our slide topper as deficient at the back end, as it was too short, letting water in under the topper, water finding its way into small holes in roof. We had to replace topper, reseal top of slide and place patches at the (not new and obvious) pinholes. The cost was $780. (incl. $320 topper). We are so disappointed that your technicians could not come up with the appropriate solution the first time and warn others to stay clear of your service. One can only assume your approach to sales is similar and the lack of attention to detail or customer satisfaction follows suit. BUYER BEWARE! 
Andrea and Brian Carlin"
2,1,"GRRRRRR!!!!
NOT AGAIN!!
Took our trailer  for to Robert Crist for what we thought was warranty work. We called our warranty BEFORE taking it to Robert Crist!!
We ASKED them to check with our warranty,to be sure and LET US know!!! NO phone call from Robert Crist! We had to call them!!They had our trailer for OVER a week for just a couple minor issues. We called them today, they STILL have never made a call to us!! They had our trailer for over a week!!! And guess what? It was ready!! WOW!
When we picked it up . . . NOTHING was covered by warranty and they did the repairs ANYWAY!!!!! GRRRRR
They were suppose to call first! Before making any repairs!!! If not covered under warranty!!!
NEVER RETURNING TO ROBERT CRIST SALES OR SERVICE!!
EVER!!!"
2,1,"This company is overpriced and sells crappy parts that break and then they don't back their own products.  They will return money contingent on if their vendor gives them credit on something that broke prior to it ever being installed or used and blame the customer for doing it, that was their main focus rather than trying to find a working solution!  Their GM and Owner Robert Crist is an egotistical arrogant man and his sales managers clearly follow example.  STAY AWAY!"
2,1,"""full"" service means you drop it off and come get it when its done! Right? 

These folks make you take it to a tire shop for alignment and if your engine don't run right you have to drive it into phoenix to have a diesel shop do a code check.

I've had my 40 foot fleetwood pusher there 3 times that started with a fridge recall and each time they keep a part like my 110 adapter or they don't replace a light bulb I payed for and one time I had to Re-fix a water line the NEXT DAY after it blew and flooded my yard and when I ask them to check w warrentee co they argue with me that it wont be covered and one time it cost me 395.00 for a covered item. 

Like a fool I take it back after loosing several $100s of food from a fridge that goes up to 75 when on the road to follow through from the 200 deductible on the last repair on it and I get argued with that it may or may not be covered! So I throw my hands in the air, make some calls and found a service place in east mesa that DOES IT ALL! 

Ran over to get it and walked into service counter to say Do I owe you anything for your troubles and they said no. I said thanks and left. No reason to make a stink as I'm done and moving on.

On the way out of service area, I overheard the mechanic call me an IDIOT!  
Actually I smiled on the way by and just as I was out nearly of range I heard 
""there goes the idiot now""

HEY I've called lots of my customers idiots over the years but NOT within earshot!
I Have a LITTLE class!

They gave me a GREAT deal on a dodge truck 12 years ago and I tried to be a loyal customer but refuse to work with these guys from now on after all the abuse!

ciao baby!"
2,1,Never checked out the RV prior to taking possession as we were promised. They said it would be gone over from front to back to make sure everything was in top working order. Now they will never call you back!! Never will deal with them again!!
2,5,Great service department. Michael and the rest of the crew always go above and beyond to make sure my motorhome is ready to roll. Thanks for all the hard work and help. I would recommend them to any and everybody who wants fast and friendly service.
4.5,5,"Today is our checkout after a ""quick stop"" that turned into a one month stay. What a wonderful, wonderful place to be. The owners are great, they only allow in respectful people, and everything is clean & tidy."
4.5,5,"*review is for shower only*

I was in the middle of a 4 day 3 night hiking adventure.  In my research I found that a campground at Lake Mead had showers.  I pulled in there earlier in the day to inquire about their showers and was turned away because I wasn't a guest.  Oh well, maybe I'll jump in the lake.

Fast forward a few hours and I'm eating dinner in town and I did a quick search for showers and this place pops up.  So I rolled on over and I asked the young man at the front desk if they offered showers for hikers.  Yes they do.  I love hiker friendly locations.  Price was fair and I was happy to pay it.  

I was given a quick tour of the bathroom and grabbed my stuff and off I went.  Shower was roomy, had great water pressure, and hot water.  I left rejuvenated and ready to tackle a couple more days."
4.5,5,"This place is the BEST!  

We have been RV'ing for 6 yrs....we stayed here for 3 weeks last winter....and without a doubt, this is my favorite of them all!   We go back as often as we can now. 

The family that runs this place is awesome......they are friendly and so helpful....they do their best to honor all requests.  They take pride in their park and it shows.   Nice clean, wide spaces......Easy access in and out. 

They offer a gated pool, huge laundry facility, locked bathrooms that are clean, Social events, plenty of local info provided upon check in and basic cable.  As far as Internet, when we did use it, I have my own Hotspot....so not an issue and I can't recall if they have it or not.   

I would highly recommend staying here and then driving into Vegas....the RV parks in Vegas are horrid.   Minutes from shopping in Henderson......and it takes about 25 minutes to get to the strip.  PLUS, You are 90 minutes from Bullhead City AZ and Colorado River fun."
4.5,5,"I'm only writing this review to be fair, but I've been putting it off because if this park gets any more popular the prices might go up. 

There are tons of RV parks in the Vegas area, and let's face it, the landscape is pretty much the same all over. So success in this business comes down to being clean, quiet, and reasonably priced. 

The folks in this park skew older, and several seem to be long-timers. Lots of them have pets as we do. I picked this park because it was outside Vegas and had a fenced pet area. Not to overstate the pet area -- you can't waste much commercial property in such things, but even if it's small it's nicer than what I've seen at other parks nearby. 

Other negatives (and there's not much) is that hubby says the men's restroom has been messy a few times and not checked/cleaned in a timely manner. Guests are asked to keep them clean but possibly some of the older gents aren't used to doing so. 

Second is that while there are about 30 machines in the laundry room, several seem to go out of order at the same time and on both my visits there was a shortage of dryers."
4.5,5,My in-laws have been staying here every winter for 10 years.  They love it and my wife and I always enjoy our stay here.  Quiet and very safe.
4.5,5,This RV park is run very well and is in a great location. The RV park is very reasonably priced. The hookups and sites are level and clean. The bathrooms and showers are very clean and the site is very quiet. The staff is constantly monitoring the site which makes you feel very secure. The only thing I would improve is providing additional garbage/recycling dumps closer to the RV sites.
4.5,5,"Very clean, quiet, well maintained park- clean, spacious showers- friendly staff- Glad we stumbled upon it: when I entered a search on my Garmin GPS for RV Parks, ""A&W Restaurant"" kept showing up- on a whim I figured we'd check it out, and there was this campground! It's an interesting story- be sure to ask Tasha what the scoop is. Thanks for a nice stay!"
4.5,5,"I have not stayed at many RV parks with my trailer, but I will definitely return to this one when I am in Boulder City.  It is very clean, very quiet and they are dog friendly.  The pull through spot made it very easy to set up."
4.5,4,"We enjoyed our stay at Canyon Trail.  Park was quiet with respectful neighbors.  We felt safe while we stayed there.  The grounds were well maintained.  The staff were also very polite and helpful.  If you don't want to stay in Vegas, and want a little bit of low key vibe, this is the place for you.  Nothing fancy, but enough of good things to warrant a stay here to be out of the city and be in a safe and quiet environment.   Highly recommend!"
4.5,4,"Reasonable rates that include electric........no electric meters.
Close to Vegas/Lake Mead/ Hoover dam.
Boulder city is a nice quite city.
Basic cable.
Spaces are long but could be a bit wider, Still plenty of room for big rigs.
Very pet friendly.
Owners are very good people.
No pool. 
Not  a whole lot of shade trees.
No grassy area for dogs to run around."
4.5,4,"This park is one of my favorite places to stay!
It's first come first serve and the space is yours for how ever long you want to stay, love that. It's reasonable and a friendly, clean and very safe environment. I'm not giving 5 stars because I think there's alway a little room for improvement ;)"
4.5,5,"Stephen arrived early and got to work. Great job and customer service. Wash, wax and even took care of some water spots the park gave us for a nomimal fee. These guys know what they're doing. Give em a try! You'll be glad ya did."
4.5,5,We called earlier today and these guys showed up on short notice and Steve did a great job. He was a nice kid and worked really hard to make sure he did a good job. Next time I am back here I for sure want him to wash my coach and do some other stuff that he recommended. My coach looks great and I'm glad I called these guys.
4.5,5,"We spent our summer in Oregon where it was dusty & couldn't wash because of water shortages then it rained the last two weeks turning our 40 ft motor home & car into a muddy mess.

We couldn't wait to get to the Oasis RV Resort to have Red Rock RV Wash clean everything to get us back to normal! We had them do our car, 40 ft. motor home and our carpeting inside (living room, under dining table & around bed as well as an area rug we have over the carpet in the living room. Big job. We were a bit concerned when they sent one guy. 

Zach was amazing though! He had a tough job but more than met the job. He did the most thorough job on every item!!  He did have issues with the carpet cleaner (the manager had to come fix) which caused extra time to finish it all. 

Everything sparkled & shined like new! I highly recommend both Red Rock RV Wash & Zach! Will definitely be returning customers!"
4.5,5,"Stephen did a great wash and wax of my Airstream while I was at Oasis RV resort in Las Vegas.  Knowledgable about Airstream finishes, he paid attention to detail and did a thorough, high quality job."
4.5,5,These guys are great Steven and Andrew washed our bus and trailer yesterday and it looks sweet!!! Thanks guys we will see you next time we are in Vegas
4.5,2,"Hit n miss. I've had one great experience, two ""meh,"" and the last was terrible. Asked in the appointment call to be sure all trim surfaces were clear of sand. Asked the same when their employees arrived. He cleaned the trim surfaces near the doors and missed everywhere else. I asked him to redo the trim. He did oneside, perhaps thinking I wouldn't look on the other side of the vehicle. 

I called and expressed disappointment.i was told they'd return in a day or so. It's been a week.

Very disappointed in this last experience, enough so that I'll see if anyone else is available."
4.5,3,We have used Red Rock R V Wash several times to wash our motorhome and we would recommend them to anyone who takes pride in their R V. The price is very affordable. The people at Red Rock RV Wash are on time and ready to do a great job every time!!!
4.5,5,"Just had our 5th Wheel and truck washed and waxed. EXCELLENT WORK!

I've been using them for about two years and never had a problem. Since our rig is stored out side, so I have them out every six months or so. 

Today it was Steven who came to do the job. He worked hard and did a did an excellent job."
4.5,5,"I was in Las Vegas on Feb 17, 2015 & met up with my friend @ the KOA campground. When I went out the next morning, Red Rock RV wash was washing the large RV across the road.  I walked over there & asked them if they could wash my high top van; it had gotten very dirty while I was driving through the remnants of the Oklahoma City ice storm.  They did an AWESOME job washing the van & only charged me $35.00."
4.5,5,"My 44' 5th wheel was is in dire need of an exterior wash and I really didn't want to move it. I found Red Rock RV Wash, Ryan answered the phone, answered all of my questions and he booked me for first thing the next morning. The 5th wheel was parked on a quiet street just outside of my neighborhood. Deandre showed up right on time, even called me to let me know he was on his way.  He spent about 2 hours washing it from the roof to the tires and it came out beautiful. I like that they bring their own water to wash it with. Great service! I would highly recommend even you don't want to spend 2 hours at the RV wash."
4.5,5,"WOW!!!! That's all I have to say about this company and specifically Randy who cleaned the exterior of my fifth wheel today! Such a nice guy, very sweet and hard working! He was fast and efficient! Did a great job and I was 100% satisfied! I would recommend them as a company and as a side note I would request Randy, you won't be sorry! :-)

Gina"
4.5,1,"We have a really hard time hurting people's feelings, so have been holding back but it's been really bothering us too, so guess it's time to put it out there.  We have had Red Rock wash our RV's & vehicle for the last couple of years.   Unfortunately, I think those days are behind us now.  I don't want to go into detail & cause this business a lot of trouble, but we are definitely dis satisfied with this last one.  We had them wash & wax our vehicle. Also, cleaned the windows.  It was a poor job & we ended up re doing it ourselves after paying $100.    Yes, that's highway robbery!!!"
4.5,5,We stopped at the Las Vegas KOA at the end of a 4 week trip. Red Rock was very accommodating in working around our schedule. The Detailer's name was Nick and he did an excellent job in washing our very dirty RV. He was very friendly and worked hard in 100+ degree heat. I would definitely recommend using their service.
4.5,1,"We have a really hard time hurting people's feelings, so have been holding back but it's been really bothering us too, so guess it's time to put it out there.

In response to your reply, we were charged $105 to wash & wax a mid size vehicle and we don't pay near that for our 40 ft motor coach.    Then, to find out by another employee...we were majorly over charged.  The employee was very lazy & we ended up having to put more money into it & redo it.  That's just not satisfactory.   Yes, we do apologize for not informing u, but it's really hard for us to complain.    Thanks for caring enough to respond."
4.5,4,Just had Stephen wash my motorhome and did a pretty fair job. He just missed one spot I noticed about 15?seconds after he left
4.5,5,"We had a couple of days while we camped in our Motorcoach passing through Vegas, and the Nellis Fam Camp recommended Red Rock. Brian took our call, made the arrangements and sent Zack out the next morning to perform a work of art, or was it magic, on our rig that had dust and mud from our trip to North Idaho. He washed the roof and sides, waxed, dried and even made the tires and wheel wells look great. Totally recommend Red Rock. Thanks Brian and Zack! Our coach looks great!"
4.5,5,We had a very nice young man by the name of Stephen come out and clean our 42 foot RV today he was very courteous and friendly and did a great job cleaning our RV He also pointed out the oxidation and recommended a nice wax and polish job!
4.5,5,"Absolutely the best RV wash I've ever gotten. Prewashed, scrubbed, rinsed, ANd dried! Did the tires, windows, and removed the bugs that the truck wash we went through left behind. Better job than I've even done myself, and that's saying something. Highest recommendation!  Worth every penny and a big tip! Thanks, Zach!"
4.5,5,"Our truck and camper were well-loved in the Utah desert and on our 2690 mile trip west. To say washing them was a chore would be putting it mildly. Zach from Red Rock RV did an outstanding job, though, and with a beautiful attitude!"
4.5,5,Zach washed our 26 ft fifth wheel and did an amazing job.  We knew it was a big job because it had been parked under trees for a year and the roof was quite dirty. But he took the time to get it virtually spotless!  Then he went over the whole rig and washed it.  It looks almost like brand new!  Thanks Zach!
4.5,5,"First wash of our 2018 Allegro Open Road and after driving south through Utah it was in need of washing. Dirt, bugs, and whatever stuck all over. Looks like new again! Reasonable cost too."
4.5,5,"We booked an RV wash for our travel trailer over Labor Day weekend.  Only called the day before on a Saturday for a next day wash on a Sunday and they sent over two guys promptly at 8am the next day.   It was helpful that they could do the wash when we were hanging inside making breakfast.  It was very convenient.

The two guys were polite, thorough, and quick.  We added in a wash for our truck after they arrived and they were happy to do that too.  Cost was comparable for truck wash anywhere else at $30 but the RV wash was very reasonable at $3 per foot.  It turned out that we paid just under $80 for the RV wash.  They wax for $10 a foot if you need that service.  Overall, we were very happy with the service and will use them again when in the area."
4.5,5,"Attention snowbirds, sunbirds, RV birds and all other birds!

If you are looking for an honest, ethical,
 ""quality focused"" company to clean you RV then call Red Rock RV wash.  Locally owned and operated by Brian and Jennie Karn. 
They take personal interest in each job.. 
you are NOT just another number!

This is not a paid advertisement. I live full time in a 37ft Bighorn in Duck Creek RV 
Park. 
I've had them clean my coach 4 or 5 times and I've always been amazed at the time and effort their guys put in. Not once have I felt they were ""hurrying to get finished !"".
They washed and hand waxed the entire coach. 
 

I'm sure when you're traveling your skeptical about who to hire. Red Rock RV Wash is one you can trust."
4.5,5,Stephen did a fabulous job on our RV. Great attention to detail and we couldn't be happier. He has great customer service and we will most definitely ask for his workmanship again.
4.5,5,"This was probably my BEST wash that our 40 ft Phaeton coach has ever received. I ordered a standard wash, wheel polish and roof (303) treatment. Nick did a terrific job. He arrived promptly on time, was very courteous, and worked diligently to bring out the best on our coach finish. 

Fantastic job, reasonable rates, and first class service. Ask for NICK!"
4.5,2,"My fifth wheel had been sitting a while and granted, the vegas sun can bake your rig - BUT.  I called and just wanted them to give her a wash. I have broken my toe, had time off work but couldnt do it myself .  The $ 5.00/ ft quoted  $190.00 would be a  nice shiney  fifth wheel !  Instead it looked  WORST  THAN. ITS. EVER. LOOKED !  To my surprise__ the cleaning product they used on my rig = stripped= any sheen it had, leaving it to look so old and sun baked !!  It had some areas of oxidation i could wipe off on my hand, before, xxxxx--but their product made mine looked very bone dry -xxx.  Maybe this was their gimmick to sell me that wax job ( that i couldnt afford since i wasnt working AND hadnt needed until later).   But boy did i need it now #@&!%,   $325.00  i had to do it, no way was my rig protected now since it was Stripped and decal was scratched up.  The guy was so sweet, but i was shocked at how little their "" wax"" made up for the damage . And when i complained that it wasnt shining  for $515.00 + 75.00 tip..... the next guy up comes along..... covering for the company that his CELL PHONE picked up my (beginning oxidation).. oh,,,, so Thats ?why my Rv looks so bad Now..?. right.   So he had the guy put on 2 ( said 3 but he was working alone and got done so soon that i dont think he did and missed a big upper area on the back slide out. When i still complained = not too noisily but i was trying to get a fair shake.... i was told i need to let it soak in for a few days.  And their work was done_ they had given me one extra wax coat.  My sides had swirls of mopped swipes of something i wouldnt call wax, im not feeling taken care of by this company... so my only other choice is to tell you folks.  Now if i needed it polished instead, why did it look worse after they used that stuff that stripped any sheen i had.?? 
 I think they are shifty and their equipment truck that shows up is so crappy, that gives it way, only in it to get the money. . They guys doing the job count on the tips so they are  working hard enough. But it takes at least 2 guys to wax a rig nicely. I didnt get that. The company sent one. And he either cut corners  and did a half hearted attempt or mixxed the product with no knowledge of the strengths of it to use. Too much detergent - or he had degreaser in with it- honestly thats what it seemed like; too much detergent and degreaser added to it - to get the outcome i got , i have waited months now just to see the * let it soak in* effect hapoen.... the up & down scratches on my decal wont  be going away. ever.  I gave it 2 stars for the guy who had to work alone , i guess i feel sorry for both of us."
4.5,5,"Red Rock has been detailing my fifth wheel and my parents' RV every year for almost 10 years. My parents come to stay at Oasis every winter and we usually go stay a week or so as well to take advantage of the resort. 

I can honestly say my rig has stayed in amazing shape because of Red Rock! On Brian's advice I get my fifth wheel waxed at least once a year and it looks fantastic! They additionally did a rim polish for my parents this year and their wheels look new. The employees are always professional and courteous. It may sound trivial but they are always in uniform and in a nice truck with the company logo. I've seen other so called detailers during my travels on the west coast who don't seem anywhere near as professional.

Thanks for the great service Red Rock, we'll see you again next year!"
4.5,5,Stayed at the Hitchin Post Rv Park and saw the add for Red Rock RV Wash.Called them for pricing and set appointment for the next day. Zack showed up 45 minutes early and introduced himself to me and my wife explained what he was going to do then got started. What a beautiful job he did.He washed the coach cleaned the windows put protectant on the wheels then polished the wheels to a high gloss. Very professional wanted to make sure we were happy.I am very particular about our coach. The job he did was outstanding. Would recommend this company to anyone needing an rv wash or wheels polished if you are in the Las Vegas area. 5STARS

4.5,5,We had my dads RV cleaned on Monday and John did an excellent job. He was a hard working young man and was very responsive. He fit us into his busy schedule quickly. Definitely recommend Johns quality work!
4.5,5,"Red Rock did my parents' coach recently and we were so happy with the job they did! They did an oxidation removal and wax and the coach looks so much better.  The guy who came to do the job was in uniform, knowledgable and super nice about explaining the job to him. I'd definitely recommend them!"
4.5,5,"Next-day service, after a late afternoon RV arrival. Great work, and ask for Zach! He is meticulous, and takes as much time as it takes to get your RV lookin' like new. Very satisfied, have used RedRock for several years now."
4.5,4,"Travelled to Duck Creek RV Resort in Henderson, NV from Grants Pass, OR. Our 5ver took a beating with the dust, dirt and bugs off of Hwy 395 and 95. 

Park host Che Jed us in and I asked where I could get my trailer washed and detailed when we left. He recommended Red Rock RV Wash. 

I scheduled an appointment and other than being a half hour late, I have NO complaints. One young man showed up. I asked where his crew was and he said that he was the crew. Our trailer was a mess and this young man worked his butt off for 3 hours. Our trailer is 35' long. He washed the roof, trailer and hand waxed the entire thing. 

Cost was $280.00 which based on the work was reasonable. If RVing in the Las Vegas area and you want your rig detailed at your site, I recommend this company."
4.5,5,"Best wash wax and detail I have had on my RV. They were on time, professional and their attention to detail was fantastic. 
Very reasonable for the level of service. Will use them anytime I'm in Las Vegas."
4.5,5,"I have worked with several marine dealerships in the past month and a few were far better to deal with than others, Quam's especially.  I worked with three people, Jason, Scott, and Mr. Quam (can't recall his first name).  Initially going in, I talked to Jason.  My wife and I were still debating getting a Pontoon or Fishing boat.  I was able to get information on new and used, pontoons and boats.  After about 30 minutes, I walked out with the information I needed and discussed it with my wife.  After some resolution between my wife and I, we went back to the dealership and talked to Scott.  We discussed many of the same incentives of the 1650 Fish Hawk that a pontoon would have (i.e. more space--with the back, fold down, bench seat--bimini top, etc.).  

Scott priced things out, included some incentive discounts we qualified for, and answered all of the questions we had.  We left that day with a lot of things to discuss.  The boat had everything we wanted but the price, although reasonable, was just out of our reach.  Two days later, I went back in ready to look at other boat options and after talking to Scott, he asked me to come into his office to see what we could do to get down to my price point.  We took off a couple of things that were not as important to my wife and I.  Scott made some phone calls to dealers, for electronics and the bimini top, to see how we could get what we wanted but cheaper.  After talking to Scott and Jason a total of four hours on a few different days, we got what we wanted for the price.  

Other dealerships I was working with became frustrated with me just after 30 minutes to an hour of questions.  This was a big purchase for my family, so I had to feel comfortable with my decision.  Scott and Jason were the most patient people I dealt with, even after changing my mind on things 5+ times.  

After the deal was done, I talked to Mr. Quam about how long it would take to put all of my upgrades on (Terrova 80, Helix 9, bimini top, etc.) and although he has three other boats to work on, he was able to dedicate time to get mine done, hopefully by tomorrow!  Working on financing and insurance, when Scott wasn't there, was easy to do too.  Jennifer from the front office helped me get all of the information I needed to get to my bank and insurance company.  They work well as a team.  I have had an all around good experience at Quam's and would recommend them to anyone interested in new our used boats."
4.5,4,"I went here to see if the could work on my vintage outboard. They told me no, but still Trevor listened to my problem and basically diagnosed what was wrong. Would give 5 stars except for the price of the part. I could have gotten the same part from iboats for 29 bucks shipped, but I chose to pay 21 extra bucks because Trevor took the time to help me thinking they weren't going to make any money off of me. Thanks Trevor. I have taken my boat out three times in the last 2 days!"
4.5,5,"Just purchased a new Bennington Pontoon from Quam's Motorsports in Stoughton, Wisconsin.  This is a family owned dealership that delivered an awesome purchase experience.  We're new to boating and they made it as smooth as could be.  John Quam was there from the beginning and has been there even after the purchase.  He personally delivered our boat to Lake Waubesa on his own truck, spent an hour on the lake, showing us all the ins and outs of our new boat.  

Even though we had ordered our new boat at the busiest possible time, John went out of his way to get us our boat ready for the big Memorial Day weekend.  He kept me in the loop, even sending me an email (3.5 hours after they closed) to let me know that they had just completed getting the boat prep'd and it would be ready for delivery the following day!  We were thrilled to be able to enjoy our boat for the weekend.

After driving our boat, we started getting a warning alarm on our motor.  John sent one of his techs right to our dock to diagnose the problem.  With no luck, John personally came and picked up our boat and took it to the shop.  Turned out to just be weeds in the water intake.  After fixing it and a few other minor issues, he personally delivered the boat after they closed.  Now that's service!

I can't provide a more positive recommendation for anyone looking to buy a new or new to them boat.  You just don't find this kind of service these days and when you do, you want to tell people!"
3,5,"My experience here has been amazing. Rented twice from this location. Once as a pickup and once a drop off and each time it's been great. It does take a while sometimes, but that's understandable, given the time of day and it's an RV, not a car rental. Never felt rushed and everyone was nice and polite.

Had minor issues with the RV, but again, it's an RV. Haha"
3,3,I'm only giving 3 stars becasue the second rep i talked to was polite and courteous. The first woman i talked to was THE RUDEST PERSON I'VE EVER HAD CONTACT WITH. Her name is Debbie. She needs to be fired.
3,5,"I can't speak about renting a unit, but we bought a unit from them used. An OLD unit. I can tell you I have NO idea why anyone would buy a used vehicle from anyone else. These people have bent over backwards to extend BEYOND exceptional customer service to us. Going far above and beyond to make sure we were happy with our vehicle. You would be lucky to have your unit need a repair just for the privilege of meeting Dave in service. Literally the nicest most straight-up guy you're ever going to meet. Did a phenomenonal job of fixing our issues, keeping us comfortable and giving us free advice for care and maintenance. 
If you want to make sure you get a fair deal, talk to Wayne in sales. VERY honest guy who is not salesman-y and not looking to hose you. You'll get a great deal if you deal with Wayne. I've never offered this before on a review, bc no company has ever impressed me so much as this one, but if you would like me to tell you all the reasons why it would be very smart to pick up an RV from their fleet, go ahead and contact me and I'll tell you how years of research lead me to this company and how experience confirmed my research for me, my hubby and our 5.5 kids.  You won't buy a better used RV anywhere else."
3,5,"I rented the 30 footer RV motor home. I'm attaching photos to my review so you can see how much room is inside. I used it over memorial weekend 2018, took the motor home to Cottonwood, AZ. The RV drives really smooth, when I exceeded 70 mph the RV shook a bit, when over 75 mph it stopped shaking, but at 65 mph, no issues or concerns whatsoever. Watch the videos from Cruise America which will be at the bottom of your confirmation email. When you go through orientation, you will have seen the videos and not be consumed by all the information the rental tech will give you in person.
They are very thorough; I just think watching their videos helped me personally.  When you drive it because of its size just take it easy, like stopping, turning and changing lanes, give yourself enough time. Once we got to the camp site, hooking up to city services (water/electric/sewer) was easy, again because I watched the video, took excellent notes and asked questions. I want to warn you about the sewer hose, wear gloves when you
pull the hose out, it had old/dried fecal matter on it. We wore gloves (e.g. washing dishes rubber gloves) while handling it.  I only mention it for heads-up matter of fact. It isn't anyone's fault that the hose is dirty, it's a sewer hose. The hose isn't long enough to insert 6 inches
like referenced in the video, but we got ours to fit into the sewer connection. Look for rocks around the camp side to put under the sewer hose - I noticed other campers had stands, this serves to help the poop go down into the system. When we disconnected we were very careful to unhook at the RV first and then pull up on the hose and ensure all the matter was emptied into the sewer. I'm not a fan of sewer systems but if I can do it, you can to.  Inside, there is a queen bed (holds up to 1,000 lbs) above the driver's area, a full bed (sofa), twin bed (where the table is) and a queen bed in the back. Instead of bringing sheets, we brought sleeping bags and pillows. The refrigerator is large and has a good sized freezer area (it is operated on propane). There is no TV and no oven to cook in. We brought our Power Air Fryer - cooked up wings, French fries and tater tots, they turned out fabulous. The stove top is great - you get 4 burners - that's plenty of room to cook up a great meal. The RV comes with a white utility table - great to use for playing card games or eating. There is plenty of storage
for all your gear inside and out in the cargo area in the rear. The shower is great & the pressure was adequate turn on the hot water heater 25 mins before use, had a hot water experience. The toilet and sink is separate from the shower and again, adequate, the toilet seat is very large, and there is a ton of room for your health and beauty items. The toilet area even has an exhaust fan for you. The A/C unit was a little quirky. Once we got there, we turned it on and left it on....  It froze during the night and we woke up to warm gentle blowing air. The lady at the RV park told us, we should of turned it off at night and opened the windows, since the nights are cooler. We did that the 2nd night. Once the unit thawed out, we had no issues with the A/C unit (lesson learned and this was my first time out, so I'll know next time). But I do want to mention, since we are in AZ if you take this RV out in the summer months (July & Aug) I would not rely on this A/C unit to keep you as cool as a home, you will be hot. The A/C unit is tiny and in my opinion, can't keep the inside cold. Bottom line, the unit worked for me and we were very lucky that memorial weekend in Arizona was cooler than normal. At pick up, I elected to pay extra ($35) to return with sewage in the tank and for propane. Both fees were refunded to me since I hardly used propane and my sewage tank was empty.  Returning the RV was a pleasure, didn't have any issues with them. You pull in and walk in and they do a quick inspection and then back inside you go for a print out of the receipt. It was super quick. I will definitely rent again from Cruise America and I thank them for allowing us to take the RV out. My family had an excellent 3-day weekend."
3,2,"I'm not impressed with this company. I live in OC, California and my parents came here on holiday from Europe. They booked an RV for the whole family, and we were really excited to go on an RV trip in California. The booking went through, but then my dad got an email from a reservation specialist ""your id verification was denied, I have cancelled"". They didnt bother calling and explaining what went wrong. Simply cancelled and that was that. We called and the answer is sorry we dont know what went wrong.The family trip is ruined. Thank you Cruise America!!!"
3,5,"We recently rented the 19' RV from this location and our experience was awesome!!! The inside was clean and perfect for 2 people. The rental process was really easy and explainable and the customer service was great. A really fun experience to rent an RV for a roadtrip!! We took it up to the Grand Canyon and parked it in Mather Campground. Dumping it on your own is actually not too bad, just remember to keep the black and gray rods PUSHED IN before you open the dump valve to put the tube in. We tried to conserve the generator use so we brought foam coolers instead for our food that had to be kept cold. We ended up only using 2 hours of the generator (which came to an extra $7--not bad!) PS: I recommend bringing a foam mattress pad for the bed, it isn't terrible but it also isn't the most comfortable. 

Highly recommend--fun, clean and affordable!!"
3,3,"Ich kann mich den so negativen bisherigen Berichten (englisch) nicht uneingeschränkt anschließen. Obwohl - Cruise America hat unter RV-Mietern nicht den besten Ruf.

Cruise America ist unter den großen amerikanischen Anbietern von RVs der Größte mit den meisten Stationen im Land. Im Gegensatz zu den anderen Vermietern hält Cruise America die Fahrzeuge aber länger, was zur Folge hat, dass bei älteren Wagen häufiger Defekte, Pannen, Unzulänglichkeiten, Abnutzungen auftreten. Das wurde uns von diversen deutschen Camper immer wieder bestätigt.

Wir hatten jetzt im April zwei 25-Fuß RV gebucht. Durch Vitamin ""B"" waren wir als VIP vorgemerkt und erhielten zwei Fahrzeuge, die ""nur"" ein Jahr alt waren und ca. 25.000 Meilen runter hatten. Beide Fahrzeuge waren tipp-topp in Ordnung, sauber und mit dem Üblichen ausgestattet. Üblich heißt aber, dass einige wesentliche Dinge fehlten bzw. nicht ausreichend vorhanden waren:

- ein Toaster ist in den USA bei dem Pampbrot dort ein Muss - Fehlanzeige
- ein Flaschenöffner und auch ein Dosenöffner sollte eigentlich selbstverständlich sein - Fehlanzeige
- der Wasserschlauch hatte so gerade die Mindestlänge, um an Campsites an den Wasserhahn angeschlossen werden zu können. Außerdem waren die Dichtungen und Schraubanschlüsse ausgeleiert
- der Abfluss-Schlauch (sewer) war sehr kurz und hatte kleine Löcher - d.h. wenig Spaß beim Dumpen, was ohnehin kein Vergnügungsfaktor ist
- Leverer - Fehlanzeige

Wir hatten bei anderen Vermietern in den Vorjahren mit diesen Punkten keinerlei Probleme. Fairerweise muss ich sagen, dass wir uns neue Schläuche kauften, wie auch Öffner und diese bei Rückgabe erstattet bekamen. Nicht jedoch den Toaster, den wir uns ebenfalls bei Walmart besorgten.

Der Service vor Ort war an dieser Vermietstation exzellent, die Über- und Rückgabe zügig, das Personal mehrsprachig.

Fazit: Der vierwöchige Urlaub verlief problemlos, beide RV taten artig ihren Dienst, es trat nichts auf, was den Urlaub - zeitweilig - hätte vermiesen können. Würden wir Cruise America wieder buchen? Ja, wenn wir sicher stellen können, kein ""Altfahrzeug"" zu bekommen. ""Camping World RV Rentals"" und ""Roadbear"" würden wir vorziehen - aber die sind dann halt auch teurer."
3,4,"Easy to rent and great idea to do this first if you are thinking of buying one. Easy to rent online and all the fees are shown. I would do it again. 
They include insurance and roadside assistance unlike most of the other Rv rentals. 
I wish they came with an awning and kitchen stuff was my only complaint. There is a Walmart close by so you can load up there."
3,1,"I had a reservation for a standard RV indicated for pick-up at their Santa Rosa location. The vehicle was not available at the time of pick-up. After waiting until almost 2pm on July 6th we left and were told our deposit would be refunded. After numerous calls and requests - all of which were ignored or delayed - one of their accounting managers got personally involved and made sure our deposit was finally refunded....but not until almost 2 months later. (thanks to him, at least!)

Their general customer service leaves much to be desired ...including the fact that escalated issues such as this can only be handled in writing. I don't need to be told numerous times to write a letter to get a deposit refunded two months after the it should have been done without question and without hassle. I don't need to bother a guy in Accounting to take care of this for me when it is ignored by district managers, field locations or other minions.

Don't expect future business from me. In fact, I am considering legal action for the difference we had to pay in renting another RV at a higher price at a different location because the one we had reserved was not available. 

An absolute waste of time. Avoid these clowns at all costs."
3,4,"We rented an RV for a week long road trip to UT and AZ and had an overall great experience with Cruise America. When I called customer service to change our start and end dates they were very accommodating and sent me an updated confirmation email within 5 minutes. On the day of our trip we arrived well before our pick up time of 1pm, eager to start our trip. They had the RV ready and we were able to set out on the road way ahead of schedule. The RV was not super clean, but was in pretty good shape. A cabinet door hinge was loose when we got it and it ended up breaking off during the trip, but when we returned it and explained the situation they said it was fine and no extra charge. We would definitely rent from this company again!"
3,1,"I would not recommend renting an RV from Cruise America. The RV we rented was not properly maintained. The wheel studs sheared off during our drive cross country creating a unsafe situation. We were fortunate not be involved in an accident. The travel assistance that Cruise America offers is very disorganized and not very helpful. The travel assistance staff wanted us to drive the vehicle in its unsafe condition to a Cruise America rental office that was 30 miles away. When we refused, the representative sent out a tow truck the following day. There was not an apology or concern about the loss of time to our vacation. When the tow truck driver refused to tow it due to safety concerns, the travel assistance supervisor had to be pressured into offering us a replacement vehicle. It took a full day to receive the new vehicle which was an older model than we had rented. It had smaller storage space and it did accommodate all of our storage needs. When we complained we were told there was no option and nothing they can do. The travel assistance staff was not very helpful and not forthcoming with full information. Upon return of the RV, the rental company did credit us for the down time that we had. However, we were not informed this would be the case by the corporate office. Each time we called the 1-800 number, we were placed on hold, we had to leave our information and then wait for a representative to call us back. At times we had to call several times to find out information regarding a replacement vehicle. We had to argue in order to get permission for a rental car while a replacement vehicle was being sent to us. The new RV did not have the registration, insurance information, or rental manual. After receiving the replacement RV, a representative did not call to make sure we received the replacement RV. We rented from a national company because they advertised nationwide roadside assistance and their roadside assistance was poor at best. Both RV's were in disrepair including: AC vents were broken, draws and cabinets did not remain closed during driving, outside storage units did not lock properly, screws were falling out of the bench seats, the refrigerator was missing shelves and storage compartments, the digital display on the refrigerator was broken, the indoor under the bed storage compartment was broken, the side windows did not close properly, and gas mileage was far below advertised mileage. The local rental agent was far more accommodating and was concerned about the safety of the vehicle. But if you rent an RV and have any problems, the corporate services are poor and the vehicles are not well maintained."
3,5,"Amazing! These folks (David S. in the rolling into AZ program) did SUCH an amazing job! We are military and have a very limited budget, David helped create a plan that got us what we wanted, at a affordable cost - we even had enough left over to stay in some nice KOA's. They made a cherished memory happen for a family that truly needed it. No hidden costs, everything in writing, soooooo flawless, 

We expected bumps as we rented a unit in SF, California, dropped it in Mesa, AZ 5 days later, and picked up a 2nd unit for the return drive home. It was complicated and could have been a nightmare of logistics. Nope. It was seamless and easy. 

Thank you so much. I'll rent from them again !!!"
3,4,"This is our third rental from Cruise America. This time we picked up the 30 ft RV from Mesa, AZ office. Karen from the rental office was polite, patient, and helpful in sending us on our way. 

I would have given five stars if it weren't for a couple items: 
1) There were little business card sized air freshener cards spread throughout the RV. One in the bedroom, one in the bathroom, one on the dining table, and the mystery one that took forever to find under the drivers seat. They saturated the entire unit with toxic scent that almost had me returning the RV before we left the house. I felt nauseous and my wife had a terrible headache. The smell went away after about 48 hours of discarding them. The detail dept needs to do away with these. I'd rather smell the previous renters dirty diaper smell than those little cards. 
2) The air conditioner worked fine but was insufficient for the 108° temps at Lake Powell. We will need to plan our next trip for milder conditions."
3,1,"I am an easy customer to please. I've worked in customer service for as long as I can remember, and the last thing I want to do is give someone a hard time, because I definitely know what a pain in the butt that is. 

But...

...Cruise America gave me a 30ft death trap. Between the leaking sewage, the main cabin door swinging wide open on a consistent basis DURING the drive (because it was clearly a badly broken door), the inoperable back door (MAJOR fire hazard), and the crazy swinging cabinets (many latches were broken so we had an uncontrollable problem with things flying out), it was hard to enjoy the trip itself. The RV would throw itself into different gears while going 65mph. This thing was seriously dangerous, and that's coming from someone that has driven some true pieces of trash in the past. It is not fun driving something that huge, let alone when it's falling apart in the process. 

But that's not even why they receive a 1 star...

The cherry on top was my experience returning the vehicle. When I went up to customer service to let them know about the issues with the vehicle (honestly, I had a flight to catch and all I really wanted was a ""we apologize for the inconvenience""), they shamelessly, blindly, and unjustly accused our group of smoking in the vehicle and hit us with a $250 smoking fee!!! When I argued, they quickly agreed to lower the charge to $150 (a ""kind of smells like smoke"" fee, I guess??). They kept us waiting for hours at both pickup/dropoff, and I had a flight to catch, so I couldn't keep waiting for the manager to go to the back of their shop to ""discuss things"" for 30 minutes at a time. I still CANNOT believe that I got charged for that (or that I paid it, really), but I will most certainly be disputing any charge that they hit me with. Really lost some faith in humanity with that experience overall (dramatic, yes, but they really were that terrible, I promise). 

Listen, I know an RV sounds like a lot of fun and a great idea (and it is, in theory). But DO NOT use this company. You'll be setting yourself up for a really taxing experience from start to finish. Do yourself a favor and look for other RV rental companies or consider other options in general. 

After all, vacation is supposed to be an enlightening and enjoyable experience, not an unsafe and stressful one. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: this was not an isolated incident, we spoke to several people at both pick up and drop off and they had very similar horror stories. Many said it was their first experience with Cruise America (and, I'm assuming, last experience with Cruise America)."
3,5,"Three times I've used cruise America with 0 issues. Truly exceptional. Small RV problems, but cruise America made it right! Highly recommended!!!!"
3,1,"Worst company ever, run very fast away. We rented a large RV for a 4 day camping trip as my daughter has two very small children and we needed to make sure they had the basic needs while camping, the RV overheated a hour within the drive so we had to drive the rest of the way with no air so it would cool the RV down, didn't have water the entire 4 days, so no cooking, showering, or using the bathroom! the smoke detector fell off while driving, the microwave didn't have a plate so it could not be used, the RV needed to be jumped started on day 2. This is just some of the issues, we took pictures and recorded some as well. We returned the RV and they did not want to comp us for all the issues and said if we didn't sign the contract that we were pleased with the services we would not get the 300.00 deposit back. I am in shock that they treat customers this way. The rep said they would have the mechanic check all the issues and if some are found they would then comp us, hey.. we have the videos and pictures showing what happen. I will wait a few days to see the findings but this is just horrible."
3,5,"We had an excellent experience with Cruise America checkout was easy simply set an appointment and the location was easy to find, it is about 15 minutes away from the Phoenix airport. Check in will take you around 20 minutes,10 minutes of which is a basic instructional and walk around of the RV, I did the pre-pay for the dumping of the sewer and gray water for $35 and the pre-refill of the propane which is also $35.trip which I  stayed around the Phoenix area everything was as delivered as promised with the exception of a fuse had been tripped for the roof air-conditioning,(easy fix just flipped the fuse back)upon return I simply gassed upat the gas station about two blocks away, wiped down the interior of the unit with 409 and borrowed a broom from Cruise America, I also mopped down the floor with 409 and paper towels. check in was easy and got my entire security deposit back. Be sure to clean the unit upon return!"
3,3,"You know...the units are kind of tacky with the landscape decals all over them but who cares.  I like the experience of taking my home with me.  

The staff at this location was very friendly as other reviewers have stated and I also have to agree with them on the quality of the units.  Ours was a 25' unit and it was older.  By the third day the kitchen sink hose disconnected and leaked water outside of the rig.  Not a big deal but an inconvenience.  This little nuisance did not spoil our vacation and everyone who rents an RV needs to expect some kind of issue.  These units get hammered. 

This is our third Cruise America rental and we still enjoy them.  The only thing I wish is they get rid of that tacky decals."
3,5,"Okay folks, this ain't our first rodeo when dealing with Cruise America RV Sales. We bought a 2010 Majestic 19G from the Carson, CA location back in Feb 2013. Since then, we have put more than 25 thousand miles on the rig. Routine maintenance, a set of tires, and a flush valve in the toilet has been our only expenses (not counting an occasional power wash). We bought the extended warranties on the chassis and the interior, and have never had to use either one. Using truckstop fuel, our mileage has been 11-12 mpg.

Nearly three years later, the story continues...we just traded up to a 2011 27G. After two or three phone calls to Dave Jones at the Mesa, AZ location, we drove from Texas to see and buy a larger rig. We arrived just before noon. Mr. Jones was there to greet us and show us several rigs. A serious test-drive confirmed our choice. We chose the 19G's bigger brother, the 27G.

Lunch and a short negotiation period later, we received a fair trade-in and did the necessary paperwork. A cashiers check and a title swap, the deal was done. It took an hour or so to transfer our ""stuff"" out of the 19G into the 27G...done and out the gate just before dark.

Had to go back the next day for a couple of nit-picky gripes to be fixed ( a broken passenger armrest and a loose side mirror). After about an hour and a 43 gallon fill up, we were soon in rush hour Phoenix traffic on our way to San Diego. A gas top off on Yuma figured that we were getting 10 mpg at 65 mph...not bad considering the larger size rig and the much larger Triton V-12.

This RV will probably our last; however, if we want another one...we will return to Cruise America."
3,1,"We've rented from Cruise America 3 times. The first rental was fine so about 2 years later, we decided to take a trip from Phoenix to Montana with our grandkids. While we were traveling, our right front wheel was doing some crazy things. We had to re route our trip back to Idaho to get the vehicle fixed. It took an entire day, we had to cancel a reservation and had 4 bored grandkids as well. Once the rental was fixed, we returned back home. I thought it was bad luck and Cruise America gave us reimbursement for the cancelled reservation as well as compensation for the inconvenience.  We rented another vehicle this year and this time it was a belt for our engine that sounds like it's going to break or snap anytime. I called travellers assistance and was told by some young lady that since we parked the vehicle at our home (& missed 2 days with the rental for the rest of our trip, not to mention having to change reservations ), there was nothing they could do. My husband called and spoke with a gentleman on the phone and was told to bring the vehicle back on the due date. We hope that when we leave to do that today, it doesn't break down, but your customer service in travellers assistance really sucks! Hope to have some better answers today and hope to talk with someone in Corporate about the shabby vehicles they lease!"
3,1,"This is to MESA ARIZONA CRUISE AMERICA CORPORATE HEADQUATERS (Or in my opinion one room of people at the same table!).  I already made a complaint on YELP about the Federal Heights Location in Denver Colorado about what the did to me!

I have never dealt with a company like Cruise America in my life! When problems happened (serious problems), they refused to escalate any issues to Customer Service saying they had NO Customer Service Department, and Road Assistance handles everytHing.  At first I thought this was B.S. but once I started trying to work with them to get my broken RV up and running I realized its all one people in a room.  This was during a phone call with the rep Dan who wasted 2 hours trouble shooting on the phone and arguing with, so I asked for a Supervisor and Customer Service and he said there was NO Supervisor and NO Customer Service! So we hang up with him dialed the 1-800 numer again, and demanded a Supervisor, and again we got routed to ROAD Side Assistance and the ""Supervisor"" of Road Side Assistance name Donna who claimed she was the hightest person I could speak with, while talking to her I hear DAN the first CLUELESS Agent in the background! I aske her if that whas him and that was when she said yes they all work at the same table!! Unbleivable! When I finally turned the truck in 17 days short of the due date (this was supposed to be a 21 day trip to California and Back.

I received an EMAIL from HEATHER and at the bottom of the email it said Customer Service Specialist! I could not believe my eyes, when I as told over and over they had no customer service department! I told Heather this and she said that is the way Cruise America works, all issues go through ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE and Customer Service gets involved once the truck is turned in!! THAT WAS THE MOST RIDICLOUS THING I EVER HEARD!  I told her that her compnay is a REACTIVE Company putting out fires, and need to take a PRO-ACTIVE approach to be there for their customers, so they have someone competent to speak with, and rectify the situation before it becomes blown up out of control! Every Review about POOR Customer Service is because of their Business Structure, Failure to train employees on how to ensure trucks are Safe, Clean, and Working, as well as, train them to show the customer the important areas of the vehicle like HEAT! 

I have already submitted a complaint to the Better Buisnes Bureau and found out they already have over 70 complaints filed, there are all nightmare reviews throughout the internet, There is a FAcebook page that says ""I hate Cruise America"", there is another page that says ""Pissed Cruise America Cusotomer Website, and many more and everything they complian about is just like my nightmare with Cruise America, I just wish I read them all before invested over $7,000 just for the RV and Mileage for the 21 day trip that last 5 days with Cruise America! I wound up spending over $12,000 because we dumped the RV, cut out the entire vacation, and just go to Colorado (where I lived for 10 years), and had to rent DOUBLE ROOMs because we had to lug stuff from Place to Place and Car to Car, and rent a One Way SUV to lug evertything across country! I am still wating on an answer from Cruise Americe to see if they will be reimbursing me for what I am aksing for!

Here is what happened, it's unbleivable!:

I have never in my life dealt with such an UNPROFESSIONAL company that had NO REGARD for the Safety of their Customers. I rented a Cruise America Truck for 21 Days (5/28 to 6/18).  I am a Disabled person that was really looking forward to spending time in a low stress environment out WEST away from the East Coast.  Our plan was to go to Yellowstone National Park for 4 Days, and then Montana, Idaho, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Lake Powell Utah, and then stop in Colorado for a couple days then back to NJ.  Little did I know that I was in for the worse time of my life! 
Due to the negligence of Employees failure to show the inside of the truck, and follow protocol, and failure to have them give us a SAFE Truck and truck that had a working Generator, charging portholes for cell phones and GPS (we had only one that worked), and failure to show that there was a HEATER that ran off of a BATTERY and not Generator, Alignment comletely off, Generator Broken, Ants infested in truck, Fridge spoiled all the food. The truck was dangerous and actually ran someone off the road!  There is limit to YELP for amount of TEXT allowed, and to put the whole story of what happened, but I'm sure yo get the idea! STAY AWAY, take photos, save receipts, take videos!"
3,1,My husband and I rented the RV we were given a very brief walk around and told that the RV was working. We found out after leaving and getting the unit home that there was no sewer hose. We called the RV facility and were told that the dump would be taken care of. So that was nice of them. Then we drove 75 miles out to the desert for my family camping trip. When we went to turn on the heater the first night we found it was not working. Since the office was closed we froze all night and waited til the morning for the company to open. When we called the Spring Valley office we were told we would be authorized up to $50 for a space heater or we can call Travelers Assistance.  I called Travleres Assistance and they took me througha list of things trying to fix the issue. The heater was still not working. They said we had the option of driving 100 miles (at 17 cents per mile) to El Centro and waiting for them to service the vehicle or they could authorize up to $75 for a space heater. I did not want to waste my money on mileage to fix a broken unit nor waste a whole day of my short vacation fixing something that is broken that shouldnt have been in the first place. My husband rode his quad to Borrego Springs looking for a space heater later in the day and to local shops looking but to no avail. So now we stayed in the RV for a second night only to find out the water heater doesnt work either. When we returned the unit the guy at the desk offered to refund another $150 to my card but said if I contact customer relations I can dispute it further. I opted to take it up with Corporate and contacted their customer relations department. Per the receptionist there is not a single person I can talk to but I can email because they require everything in writing. I emailed several times and was only told I could have a $150 gift card and sorry for the inconvenience. I basically paid $500 for a glorified tent. I could have saved myself the headache and trouble and just stayed in a tent. Not only is the company stonewalling me but they are treating customers very rude and disrespectfully. I have never been treated like this by any company. I contacted the BBB in Arizona and filed a dipute against them.  I also contacted the state Attorney General.  This company's customer service is appalling and they are most disrespectful and rude people I have ever met or dealt with in my life.  I will NEVER rent from them again!!!!  I urge you to do the same.  Spend the few extra bucks and go with someone else.  This place is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!  RUN AWAY FAST FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!
3,4,"Had a great experience booking the RV, the gentleman I spoke with was very helpful and informative. Picking up was a good experience, they were busy but took the time to explain everything thoroughly and go through the RV with me. The RV has around 125k miles on it, but was in surprisingly good condition (maybe renovated?). Very happy with the entire experience at this location.
However I was involved in an accident that was obviously the other persons fault (they side swiped the back of the vehicle while i was stopped at a light). When I dropped off the RV I had to pay the $1000 deductible, which is understandable, but getting it back was a bit of a pain. I was given some incorrect information which caused me a lot of wasted time and stress. Eventually I got the money back, but I was pretty unhappy. However they reached out and helped explain the situation and sound committed to improving that process (i've seen other negative reviews because of this). All said I would definitely rent from them again, and thought customer service and the unit provided were great."
3,5,"I was planning a trip to Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks by RV. I called Cruise America and scheduled a 5 day trip to those locations from Henderson Nevada, a ride of over 1100 miles round trip. I made the reservation and paid the deposit of $300. I later found out that I could have rented the RV from Fresno CA a trip of 340 miles. I called Cruise America and wanted to change the reservation from Henderson to Fresno. I was informed that ALL changes after their deadline would forfeit my deposit with no exceptions. This is their written policy;

""We are happy to make some changes to your current reservation, however the change may require a rate adjustment based on current rates in effect at time of change. Changes are subject to current availability. No changes will be permitted to a reservation once the cancellation deadline has passed.""

So i reluctantly made a new reservation with the Fresno depot, picked up the RV and had a great time on the vacation. Upon returning the RV to Fresno and settling our bill with Jackie, I mentioned the $ 300 that I lost on the original rental. This lady immediately got on her phone and emailed her supervisor about this issue. Upon returning to Miami a few days later, I got a call from Jackie and she said that the $ 300 would be refunded to me. That Is CUSTOMER SERVICE. I managed supermarkets in NYC from 1973-2000. There is no more difficult place in the world than NYC to learn how to handle customer complaints . I'm a pro when it comes to customer service. I own a few businesses and our success is based on two rules.
#1 The customer is always right
#2 If the customer is Wrong, refer to Rule #1

Anyway this lady went above and beyond to help me and her business deserves a A+ for customer service. By the way the rental for the 4 nights with mileage came out to a little over 500 bucks and was a definite bargain.
Kudos to Jackie and her supervisor for doing a fine thing."
3,1,"The local branch isn't so bad but the business it's self is like a horrible service, they will not work resheduling. The 1 800 number is the worst customer service.
Please rent from anyone else"
3,1,"These people are rude and non-customer oriented. Watch out for hidden fees ie; house keeping, extra mileage, contract closure date, propane tank fill, generator run time....on and on and on. A/C barely worked, heater didn't work at all. We were told to go buy a small space heater. Turned in rv under mileage and spotless, the facility I rented from didn't check in for two days and I was charged an additional 40$. Crappy service gets crappy ratings. Not to mention, the beast we rented at 7 miles to a gallon cost over a thousand dollars in fuel."
3,5,"This place is awesome, service and kindness are incredible. The manager on the rental side, Karen, spent a good 40 minutes helping us understand how to use the rv and all its features. As first time RV'ers, we were going to the Grand Canyon, Four Corners, Pike's Peak, Garden of the Gods, and Boulder. We used the Cruise America discount at KOA campgrounds every night and had a blast seeing the beauty of America. Kids, 9 and 11, LOVED it.
Toward the end of our trip, my husband became suddenly very ill and required hospitalization for several days in Albuquerque, about seven hours from home. We returned the RV moments before it was due back because of our unexpected delay. I explained to Karen what had happened and that we'd not had time to fully clean the unit before return so to just charge me whatever cleaning fees were appropriate. Instead, she said, ""You liked it? Just come back then. No fees, you have enough on your mind already.""
It's sadly rare to find that kind of service and compassion anymore. This place has got it. I'll never rent or buy an RV from anywhere else, they just won a forever customer. 100% awesome experience with this business, highest recommendation."
3,1,"Horrible!!!! My family and I rented an RV for a cross country Military move from CA to RI. We rented the RV due to our newborn being a preemie and not being able to fly with him. I also have a 21 month old daughter, so we thought this would be a good alternative, Boy was I wrong!!! The RV was a piece of junk. It was so loud and rattled like it was going to fall apart, the thing was dirty, the sink was clogged, the kitchen sink leaked water and the one ""amenity"" we really needed, the microwave for heating bottles stopped working 2 days in. So much for convenience! Not only that, when we finally hit the Midwest where the weather was snowy, the windshield wiper flew off. Upon returning the RV to RI, we went to empty the water tank and the pipes were frozen!! The place that rented it to us didn't winterized it knowing damn well we were taking it one way to Rhode Island. Needless to say not only did it cost us $2500.00 to rent but they kept our 500.00 security deposit, citing it was our fault!!! I am going to make sure this company will not get any business from anyone we know and so on! Cruise America should be ashamed of there selves, screwing people over the way they do, especially someone who Serves America!!!! The worst company ever!!! Save your money and fly first class, it will be a hell if a lot cheaper!!"
3,5,"We rented a 30' motor home for a three week trip and found that the rig was clean when we picked it up and was very comfortable inside.  The Ford powered rig ran perfectly for our 3,000 mile trip. The staff was pleasant and answered all our questions. We would recommend Cruise America, Mesa, if you want to try an RV."
3,4,We had a 27 foot rental and it fit 3 people with lots of space. It was easy to use for first timers. The customer service at the Flagstaff rental location was excellent. We had no issues with our unit and we able to pick up and drop off as early as 7am.
3,5,"The service was friendly, charming and casual. The staff created a comfortable environment, which was the perfect way to set the tone for our vacation. Since this was my first time renting an RV John was very patient and accommodating in showing me how everything works and refilling the necessary tanks. Thanks John and Jackie. See you soon."
3,4,"OK, this was my 1st RV experience in 20 years. We had alot of fun and it was easy to do. My 1st comment to all the people out there is to get educated on RV operation. Seriously, think! 

Ask more questions and watch videos on using an RV before you even book. Important, shop smart on what you need before getting on to the trip. All RV rental companies are in the business to make money, get a deal, and be smart. 

So, if the equipment does not work, its your fault for not asking and accepting it.  I reviewed everything with the guy and asked standard RV questions. He was very helpful even though there were a few people waiting.

Our RV was at 127k miles, it was like a car at  127k miles. I realized this and checked everything out, tires good, suspension a bit old, tracking straight but the correct amount of wear for this mileage. 

Things to buy and bring. . . bacon, butter, spam, pasta, ground beef, eggs, sausage, cheese, some basic spices, milk, oj, beer, wine, (bourbon optional) wine bottle opener, bottled water, paper towels, bar soap, shampoo, hair dryer,  lysole can, toilet paper, beach towels, dish soap, and scrubby for the sink. Simple. . . 

Overall I think they are doing a good job based on volume. Not Disney, you are out to save money or move the family! 
Thanks!"
3,2,"This is a tough review to write; sales was one thing, and the ""closer/finance guy"" was something ENTIRELY different. I wanted this to be a two-star review, but my wife insisted on a three-star, simply because of our sales guy being such an ace.

Jim C, our sales guy, met us at an offsite show, collected our contact information, and indicated he'd seek out the right RV for us. 4 weeks later, he called and had one for us to look at. Sure enough, it was pretty much what we wanted. After some haggling and a very productive and positive negotiation through him, we traded in a 2010 trailer and purchased a new 5th wheel. 

On the lot, Rod and ""Captain G"" were incredible. They clearly understood that the customer is what writes their paycheck. When the time came to close the deal and sign the paperwork, we ended up in the office of their finance guy, Mike N. 

Smug, condescending, smarmy, talking too fast, filled with assumptions, he was the epitome of the fast-talking, snake-oil sales guy that everyone caricatures and can't stand. He'd sneaked in an additional warranty, and when I asked him about it, he tells me ""it adds less than 30.00 a month to the cost, you'll be glad for it. I asked him to break it down. Suddenly, $30.00 a month became 42.00 a month. Except the way he'd written it, it worked out to 75.00 a month over the term. Not just a sneaky, snaky guy, but an untruthful one. Yep, ""scumbag-salesperson"" definition was met at all points.

The creep has a sign in his office that says ""It takes months to earn a customer's trust and less than a minute to lose it."" I pointed out to him that he'd reached that point with me. He shrugged at says, ""Whatever, bro."" Sleazebag to the end.

I told our salesperson that I was ready to walk over this faked warranty. My wife suggested I call AAA and Good Sam (We're members of both) to see if they offered a similar warranty. They do. $25.00 a month for nearly double the coverage of what the snake was pushing down our throats and trying to make us feel badly for not wanting/purchasing it. He made it sound like re-writing the paperwork was a huge ordeal and would take hours, trying to capitalize on our lack of time after having been there for two hours already. Strange, once we purchased the AAA extended warranty, it took him approximately 10 minutes to reprint everything and get us on our way. 

We've heard nothing back from Findlay RV since that moment.

Conversely, we had spent one sixth the amount of money with Findlay Chevrolet service in this same week. They bent over to communicate clearly with us, provided us a rental car while they were upgrading and repairing my big diesel, and have followed up twice. Once over email, once over phone. 

Findlay clearly has winners and whiners. 

Huge shoutouts to Jim C and Captain G at the RV dealership, and to Don P at the Chevy shop in Summerlin. Both great people. 

I'm willing to bet the negative reviews of the RV dealership are related to Mike N, who is a terrible representative of decency and sales-ability for Findlay.

Downgraded review after returning to purchase a part and finding that although they told us over the phone they had it, they didn't. 

Moreover, it's been three months, and no ""Thank you,"" no follow up email or snail mail...usually when someone spends a substantial amount with any sort of car, truck, RV, real-estate agency, a ""thank you"" of some sort follows."
3,1,"Well, we aren't ones to complain or write terrible reviews, but sometimes it needs to happen & this is definitely one of them.   We had some good friends take their RV into them for repairs and when they got it back, the right side had burnt plastic stuck to it & scratch marks.   If this is how Findlay RV treats their customers, we won't ever recommend them nor take ours to them for any reason.   That's just unacceptable!!    We wanted to give them no stars, but it wouldn't let us post this review."
3,1,"Horrible experience here. Had talked to them ahead of coming in to make a deal about trading in 5th wheel and purchasing a motorhome. Then when I came in to close the deal the jacked up the price of the motorhome by $5,000 from they told me the price was when they showed it to us and then reduced what they said my trade in was worth. Very dishonest in my opinion. Went to Blue Dog RV found a nicer motorhome for less money and got $8,000 more for trade in. Stay away from this place."
3,4,If you're in Vegas and need repair work Findley RV on Boulder highway were great. Got me in with very little lead time. Fixed the issue I brought it in for and even managed to do some additional work I didn't ask in advance for. Great customer service and prices on par with the industry. Good folks will be back.
3,5,Being retired we decided to investigate the possibility of traveling more so today stopped by Finley Rv to just to get some info about RVs.  Tracy was our sales person and he was absolutely wonderful! He asked questions to determine what would possibly be our best fit in RVs and then proceeded to show us a number of units. At no time did he try to pressure us or hurry us and he was great about answering all of our questions as well as bringing up things we hadn't thought of. He knew we were just looking and weren't planning on buying today and was still gracious in his presentation of the units and our information gathering - when we do decide to buy we will definitely be coming back here and dealing with Tracy.
3,5,"Been searching for an rv for a while, wasnt sure if i wanted a travel trailer to pull with the jeep wrangler, which means a tear drop ( light weight) or a class c coach and pull the jeep.
Finally decided on a winnebago fuse, sent out quote request to a few dealers. Findlay the only one to call me back in a day.
They had the model i wanted and helped get into it within a week.
No regrets, lots of info an training when i toke delivery."
3,5,"My husband and I stopped in to check out a few class A models.  Kevin Chalker helped us so much.  He gave us so much valuable information about what to look for in an RV.  Kevin took us through several class A models, answered all our questions and now we seem to be closer to making thus dream come true.  We did not purchase today from Kevin but I can  tell you that when we finally pull that trigger on the RV, we will purchase from Findlay and Kevin will be our salesman."
3,1,"First time buying (used)travel trailer , definitely be the last buying from here. Whatever the sales staff says about not selling units that leak or have problems, get it all in writing before you , sign anything or buy anything.
I was told by several staff members before and during my purchase how Findlay does testing and checks out used trailers before selling them and one of my concerns I told several staff members was my concerns about leaks because I was going to be traveling to Oregon for work and living in my travel trailer. Needless to say almost exactly a month to the day of me purchasing my travel trailer I'm up in Oregon and within 2 weeks of being here, rain storm and I have leaks. I talked to the assistant manager today and the first things he wanted to know was if I got it in writing about no leaks and if I had purchased an extended warranty ( not that I expected them to put any money towards the $750 I'm about to pay to have the roof resealed, I can be considered crazy but I'm not stupid) . With the answer to both of those being no, the conversation didn't go anywhere. He didn't show no concern for there being the ever slightest possibility of me being verbally miss led to believe that they do testing for leaks or anything. Not the slightest bit of remorse that I felt like my customer experience was a bad one. He did explain that it was my right to call and talk to the general manager tomorrow because today was his day off. As if he has to tell me that and I don't know it. Which I plan to. Like I said if they tell you something that makes it sound like that's gone the extra mile for quality & reassurance about a used unit , make them give it to you in writing before you purchase anything from here. 
Just to update my experience I tried to contact the manager twice within 3 weeks unfortunately he must of been too busy to answer the phone and I had to leave a voice message both times to which I still haven't received a call back 2 months  later."
3,3,"Staff is friendly. Have had CONSTANT problems with my brand new rv but they have fixed everything when I have brought it in. Honestly though, buying new you would assume you wouldn't have any issues and thus far I've had it serviced at least 10 times. That being said thank god its under warranty. So advice for someone who has never bought new... maybe used is the better way to go because an 80k motor home still has issues anyway."
3,5,Six months ago we went to Findlay after Camping World couldn't repair our shower facet in our Rv. The gentleman in the parts dept. was exceptionally helpful and sold us a part so we could fix it ourselves. Today we took our Winnebago Journey to Findlay for an electrical issue. Mike in the service dept. was very professional and great to work with. I will never go back to Camping World again. We will only go to Findlay with Rv problems in the future.
3,1,"WOW, $65 to check the air in your RV tires?!!  We took the RV in for a couple of repairs as we usually do here in Vegas when we go through.  This time we feel we were taken advantage of.  It was $65 to tell us how to use the wiper switch correctly, a $65 fee to fix the shade which was fair, but the $65 to check air in 6 tires was over the top to stick it to a yearly returning customer.  Adios Findlay, there are other places here that would like our business.  We got better odds at the gambling table!"
3,2,"Service dept. is rude and very unhelpful.  They offer you no information on your questions.  Like pulling teeth and the more information you ask for like ""when can I expect it because it's been over 4 weeks"" they get snippy with you.  Kathy in sales is great but the service dept really needs some work.  Go somewhere else to get parts and service."
3,5,"There really needs to be two Yelp pages, one for service and one for Sales. I have no experience with service other than getting my keys from them and they were helpful and nice. 

My experience with sales was FANTASTIC. I cannot express to you what a long decision this was for us. We took like 6 months before we made a decision. We started with a $130,000 motor home and ended up buying a $16,000 trailer. Kathy was incredibly nice to us the entire step of the way. Everyone who we had the pleasure to encounter was nice and helpful. The finance department got me a great deal which is difficult because I'm self employed. Kathy is a top notch sales person who will stay extra time to make sure you have exactly the right rig for your needs. This is our first trailer, but not our last! We hope to buy a motorhome from Kathy some day. 

Thank you to everyone at Findlay RV for making our dream come true."
3,1,"Worst customer service I've ever experienced at an RV dealership. The customer service rep. Did not answer our questions and told us to get out of here. He approaches us with a negative attitude from the get go. We asked for a comparison of the XLR trailer they have out front in comparison to a Winnebago toy hauler and the only answer he gave us was that the XLR has an all season package where the Winnebago does not. Then he proceeded to say that Winnebago are pieces of shit when they carry their products on their lot. We have been researching the Winnebago and they have the all seasons package and we states this. He then proceeded to tell us we were wrong and don't know what we are talking about. He told us we were wrong and to get out of their lot and to ""enjoy our Winnebago""
I will NEVER buy any product from Findlay."
3,2,"Well, I wish I could say good things about this place.. We bought a middle of the road lite rv with a slide out. After the completion of the deal, we were offered an insurance policy for $2500 plus. Thinking we had a newer used rv that had been serviced and detailed before going back on the market at Findley's we declined due to the high price that they were asking for this plan. Granted it was for 5 years but who would of thought I would need it immediately!!! Everything has gone wrong with this RV, the sliding mechanism, the stripped propane tank, the leaking toilet, the seal to the toilet that wont hold water, the jack that is no longer electric. We bought in January, we took our first trip in May!! From the time is was bought to the time we left, it went no where but was used to house our family as guests.. What a shame!!! When we called the service dept they were booking two weeks out and could not schedule us for our first repair in a timely manner!! Again, what a shame!!"
5,5,"I have purchased two trailers from Van's RV.  I purchased my first trailer in 2002, and recently upgraded to a new toy hauler. From sales to service, I would highly recommend them over anybody. Family owned and operated, they will treat you like no other. I have recommended them to other friends and that have all been satisfied. This company is how everyone should run their business. Honest, friendly and very competitive. Thanks guys!!!!
Ken Wong"
5,5,"Back at vans for an,upgrade. Love this place. Anyone looking for a trailer, give them a look. Will make you feel like family.  Great product and prices.  Exceptional service.  Dont wast your time by going to all the other dealers with there car dealer type scams. Here you get upfront and honest from the beginning. This is my second trailer i buy here and would recomend any family member to come here. There service dept is top notch. Wont try to upsell you crap you dont need."
4.5,5,"We've been taking our cars to Valley Automotive for over 10 years and are always pleased with their service. They are nice, honest and go above and beyond to make sure we are satisfied with the work. Thank you for making your customers feel valued!"
4.5,2,Wow!  Based on the great yelps I went for an oil change and installation of a passenger view mirror..first I was told my oil pan gasket was leaking..ok..how much?? $300 or there about...ok..again Whoa! Your radiator is dry..can't hold fluid..so we recommend forget the oil pan..but get a new radiator.  $700+ picking up my 'defective radiator' ..always ask for replaced parts.
4.5,1,"2nd one star review for auto mechanics in the Henderson area. I stopped in here two weeks after stopping in at Aloha because I still needed the 120K service for my truck, along with brake work. I sat in their office for about an hour as they took my information, pulled my truck in for a brief lookover. All this time I was sweet talked into how happy they were to get a chance to earn my business, and not give it to the chain places. The owner even joked when working out the details of my service ""of how we can rip you off"".  This is probably not a good way to sell your business. Again, I was told my quote would be given to me the next day......and again....no one ever called. I'm not sure how businesses can run effectively when they don't ever call back potential customers. 

I'm a pretty patient person, and easy going....but when you fail to provide good customer service, I'm going to let people know that there must be better places out there actually willing to help. I'm going to be forced to use a chain place now."
4.5,5,"I found KC on Yelp and called him to just get a quote I had gotten from Imperial Auto (seemed a little high) and not only did he walk me through the entire list with quotes but he said he would rather see the car because he wasn't sure how and why some of the things being requested to repair were put there without actually taking the car apart. It turns out, the biggest thing we were going to repair DIDN'T need to be fixed. We would have been a return customer forever at Imperial because the problem would have never been fixed. 

KC was in communication with me the entire process checking in with me to make sure everything was okay. Not only did he slice the other quote in half but he ALSO found an important recall on the car and offered to take it to BMW!!

I am FLOORED at his willingness to help and explain everything. He is AWESOME! We will now be forever Valley Automotive customers! I was thinking it was probably just KC there that was so helpful but I have talked to Steve too and he is great as well! I never thought I would be writing a Yelp review professing my love for an auto company but I am genuinely impressed with their level of service and honesty and if you look at all the reviews, you will see it is as consistent as ever! 

If you're across town - it's worth the drive!!"
4.5,5,This is the best place in town! They are always friendly and do whatever they can to help you. There is no pressure or weird scare tactics and they work quickly. I highly recommend Valley Automotive.
4.5,5,"Valley Automotive is the best Auto Repair shop around. If your check engine light comes on they take the time to explain what the code means for you they also try to make it as cost effective as possible. They know what they are doing and always tell you before proceeding.

If you are going in for an oil change and work crazy hours they will even pick your car up do the repair and drop it back off. They always go above and beyond!

Just recently I had a problem with my transmission, they did everything they could to get it covered under warranty or fixed by the dealership. 

I always look for the best deal when shopping around and when it comes to automotive repairs there is no one better!!!"
4.5,5,"What can I say about this shop tbat hasn't already been said? KC means what he says and stands by his work. He runs his business with complete honestly and integrity. He and Mike go out of their way to find reasonably priced parts, so you dont have to worry about being over-charged.I actually live 30 minutes away from tbis shop but won't even consider going anywhere else. KC actually drove me home one time so I wouldn't have to spend money on an Uber1 I don't trust any otber shop- you shouldn't either!"
4.5,5,If you ever want to find an honest business that fix cars go to Valley Automotive.  Valley Automotive will treat you fairly.  Valley Automotive won't rip you off.  They quote you fair prices. Owner is a gentleman called KC.  The managers name is Mike.  Mike provides amazing customer service. He cares and will give you the best deal possible. After reading positive reviews on Yelp I went to Valley Automotive because a shop named P tried to rip off my wife saying the oil pan was cracked on our Chrysler 300. Valley inspected the car and then Mike came and showed me a bolt with a bad gasket that need to be replaced. I was floored. Valley Automotive saved me $900.  They told me the truth.  Unlike that shop named P who tried to rob us.  Try Valley Automotive if you want an honest shop working on your car.  I have never felt so comfortable.  Valley has my business for life!!!  Thank you guys thank you very much.
4.5,5,"I was very happy with their service. Very professional and efficient, clear and upfront about prices, and you get a detailed email report of the entire inspection at the end (even if you're just coming for an oil change). Grateful that I have an honest place to bring my Toyota and Honda to.

Thanks again"
4.5,5,I have been going to valley automotive for almost four years. They have always been honest about the work that my vehicle needs and have even dismissed as unnecessary the recommendations of other mechanics to replace parts or other such work. I have always gotten a great or fair price from them on all the work I have had done. I don't live in Henderson but take my vehicle here because I have also gotten good service at a fair price.
4.5,5,"I had a body mount bolt that would not tighten on my 03 Jeep Wrangler (body mount cage that the bolt screws into broke loose from an overtorque).  The broken / turning cage is inside the body/sheet metal of the Jeep where it would require cutting open to access.  I went by a very reputable body shop on Boulder Highway and received a estimate for $350 (seven hours of labor), a two week wait, and dropping it off all day to get it fixed.

I looked up Valley on Yelp and decided to get a second opinion from them as the original price and amount of labor involved was a bit hard to swallow.  I pulled in and one of the gentlemen said ""let me take a look at it"" and with a bit of mechanical ingenuity / know-how and five minutes of time?  He saved me from that quote / $$ above.  5 minutes. And a bit physics application.

Thank You!!"
4.5,5,"Honest, Trustworthy Auto Repair. KC will not steer you wrong. You can rest confidently that your vehicle repair needs are being taken care of here."
4.5,1,"Oh my gosh what a horrific experience. I took my car there because my transmission was slipping, the next day I called and asked to see when it would probably be done, he said come down after 1230. Well I didn't make it down there till 3 o'clock. I walked in and he proceeded to lecture me on how to drive my car. I honestly think that's when they started working on my car. So an hour later around 4 o'clock he finally ,took me out to the garage where my car was, and it look like he was just finishing up. He told me that he was just topping off my transmission fluid making sure it was full.   There a transmission fluid all over the floor. I wasn't even a block down the street and learned that my car wasn't even engaging in gears,,, I heard grinding and it was slipping even  worse than when I brought it there. When I got home I noticed there were scratches on my car that weren't there before there was transmission fluid all over my floor mats in the front and transmission fluid dripping down the front of my car by the wheels both sides of the hood, what a freaking mess, hopefully all that went wrong was he didn't put enough fluid in and there was no damage. But it sounded horrible coming home. I honestly think no one has the mechanics license in that place. No one knew what they were doing. I would not recommend this place at all it was a horrific experience"
4.5,5,"Everyone knows that you can't trust most repair shops, especially as a woman, well, that isn't the case here! This is the only automotive shop I will take my vehicle to. I recommend anybody go to this repair shop! Their prices are good, they are honest, and they have the best customer service."
4.5,3,"Honest and reliable it seems. Not the best prices in town, my AC recharge was $40 more than most other places and they charge 3% for using your card. Definitely tried pushing additional services on me even though I mentioned a dozen times I wasn't interested. Owner is really talkative and it's hard to get in and out of here. If you're like me and just want to be in, out, quick with no nonsense, this probably isn't the place."
4.5,5,"I'm so relieved to have found a good mechanic in town! These guys are the best! They are honest and very friendly, oh and they won't rip you off! I will definitely be going here for all of my car upkeep! Also check out their fb page for deals, or ask about it when you go in!"
4.5,5,"My check engine light came on awhile back and I needed to find a good mechanic shop to get my repairs done. I actually found this place on twitter/Facebook. I sent them a message and asked if I could get a quote on labor only because I had purchased the parts myself. I got a response from KC and he gave a price for what the labor would cost. I was actually really surprised that I would even get a response because most shops would blow you off and just say to come in and will check it out. The online service I received was great. He answered my questions and even offered a discount. The thing I really like about Valley Automotive is that they don't bull shit you. They will show you whats wrong and give you a legitimate fair price on what it cost to get it done. Overall the service I received through social media and in person was excellent, good mechanics and a great deal."
4.5,5,"First of all I wanna say kc is one of the nicest guy I've met for an oil change he's very enthusiastic about helping customers and very honest about what's needed to be fix in you car and you even get an update through text and a photo of what is needed to be done affordable price and great customer service, thank you kc!"
4.5,5,"I drive from the other side of Henderson to have my car taken care of here! I love that the Valley Automotive will take the time to find quality parts at a lower rate. They are honest & let you know when you don't need work done on your car! 
They have the cleanest bathroom & lounge area I've seen at an auto shop.  Plus they have Netflix available in the waiting area! I'll definitely be back!"
2.5,4,"I go here for parts for my RV. Have always had a good experience, getting what I needed at a fair price. Friendly, knowledgeable service. I have never bought an RV from them, but will consider buying my next one from them."
2.5,1,I would pass on this place. Things have really went down hill and the selection is poor and better pricing is just down the road. Sales staff is much to be desired.
2.5,1,"Called 5 days ago for a trailer hitch quote for our Cadillac SUV, and had to leave a message. Called back the next day as I did not hear back from them and gave them exactly what I was looking for. That was on Tuesday today is now Friday and I have still not heard back from them. I am actually now getting the trailer hitch installed at a wonderful place close by and highly recommend JTI Inc in Oakwood Village."
5,5,"Call us, you will not be sorry. Turn around time to fix vehicle is a day or max time 1 1/2 days. We work with all insurances too, and most jobs are neither too big or too small. Work is always guaranteed!"
3.5,2,"Having visited the southern end of Rouge Park, I know that it's a really beautiful area, all the more so when you realize it's within the bounds of such a large city.

However, the setting may be lovely, but the booking system at Glen Rouge/TRCA is inflexible and bizarre. I was hoping to bring my preschool son on a one-night camping trip this coming Saturday. I looked on the online booking site, and there was one single site available. Great! I went to book it, and it said that this weekend is a ""restricted weekend"", and that I'd have to book both Friday and Saturday.

I understand why a popular campground might have a minimum stay policy on weekends - that's not a problem. The problem was that the site was already booked/unavailable on the Friday night, so that site is essentially unbookable for the Saturday night, which is the one night I want it for. I called the TRCA booking line, as well as the campground directly, and was told politely but firmly that the only option would be to show up in person on the day first-come, first-served: not a great option when I'm travelling quite some distance via public transit and on foot with camping equipment and a small child in tow, with no idea whether we'd have somewhere to stay or not.

I'm sure Glen Rouge is a great facility, but unfortunately for us it seems the TRCA would rather have an empty site than our booking fee this Saturday night."
3.5,4,"The lots are small and not very private at all, very few have access to the river, but for the most part it's great, very peaceful, everyone minds their business and have never had a problem. I would recommend it. We stay there instead of a hotel when we stay in Toronto. The fact that they are dog friendly is the main reason we go there! They are great with that! Just wish we always had access to the river for our dog, they should make more pathways and make some space."
3.5,4,Nice park with electric on sires and water spigots throughout the park. Dump station is just outside the entrance gate and is locked when gate is closed. Clean and fair size sites.
4,2,"We live full time in our RV and travel the entire country, we have used Cummins to service or motor home in every part of the country with no issues until we had our annual service done at this location, when we made the appointment we told them that my MH has two fuel filters and also gave them the part numbers, on the day of the appointment I reminded the service writer ""Gerry"" that we wanted both fuel filters replaced! I guess I should have looked before we left? The next day I looked a found that they had only replaced one of them? The service writer did not do his job!"
3,5,We just returned home from an amazing road trip to Colorado! Everything about our vacation was perfect. The RV we rented from Going Places RV was in great condition and was perfect for our little family! We had absolutely no issues. Everything went very smooth from pick up to drop of. Alma was very nice and graciously answered all of my questions in the process of reserving the RV. Luis was very thorough when showing us around the RV and making sure we were comfortable on the day of pick up. When we returned the RV we mentioned that we had a great time and were considering renting a travel trailer next time. Rene quickly jotted a list of trailers she thought would be good for our next adventure! I can confidently recommend renting from Going Places RV!
3,5,"Another great rental with Going Places! The team did a fantastic job this year making sure our RV for country thunder was ready and in tip top condition. Renae, Jordan, Chelsea, Steve and Louis did an excellent job and are always ready to serve their customers needs. This is my third rental with the team and I strongly recommend Going Places RV."
3,4,I recently rented an rv from going places rv. I was very satisfied with the service that the employees offered. Everyone was very helpful with getting my family's vacation started on the right track. I will be returning to them for future rentals.
3,1,"We rented a toy hauler from these guys a month ago. Picked it up early in the morning and my husband hit the road to Glamis at noon.  He barely makes it out of Phoenix when someone flagged him down because there's smoke coming from the back.  Turns out an axle on the toy hauler had broken.  Thank God for a passerby because it could've easily resulted in a bad accident. It took Going Places RV 6 hours to get a new toy hauler to my husband on the side of the road.  We got to Glamis when it was dark and lost hours riding.  We bring the trailer back on Monday because they're closed on Sundays, which I think is dumb for a rental company but okay.  Trailer was turned in, nothing was missing.  But we paid a $1000 deposit and we lost a day of renting because we were stuck on the side of a road for HOURS.  After the run around for 3 weeks they finally returned just our deposit only, we were told it only take a week from the time we dropped it off.  

Everything seemed smooth initially but beware of Going Places not keeping of with the maintenance on their RV and trailer rentals.  Also beware of it taking way longer than they tell you to receive your deposit back.  I'm finally only leaving this review because the President/CEO emailed my husband last week and said he would get back to him and he never did.  So if that's the leadership that they have at this business its no wonder why the ball was dropped on the maintenance and the reimbursement of our day lost (which we never got back) and our deposit.

It's disappointing for us because this place is so close to our home and we planned on renting from them for a long time, but they've ruined it.  We love Glamis and don't want to buy our own RV because of costs, insurance and storage, thought they'd be an awesome solution but turned out to only be a headache."
3,5,"These guys were amazing.!!! I was looking for a rv rentel company that carries toy haulers and motor homes. Renee was super nice and they waited for me after 5 because I was havering my truck serviced and it was late getting done. 
 The rig did great. It was clean and had all of the cooking supplies we needed for the wife to make dinners and lunch. 
Can't say enough positive things about going places rv rentals!! They will keep my bussiness indefinitely!"
3,1,"Do not waste your time here. Move on to another agency. Their back office is unresponsive and does not appear to like money. I sent several emails to the owner Renae Canon to confirm my reservation. I also made 3 phone calls and in the last phone call was told I would have a confirmation of my rental agreement the next day. To ensure my trip would go off as planned I booked a hotel in the area as a plan B due to their lack of responsiveness. I was able to find another agency in town who was very responsive and settled the details of my rental and took a deposit all in one very friendly phone call. If you are using these folks it is probably to take some much earned time off and quite frankly this has been a huge headache. Just to make my concerns real take a peek at the email exchange (and dates) to see if this is the kind of service you want from a rental agency.

3,1,"I rented a trailer based off of their description they gave me. It was horribly misrepresented. Upon delivery the company did not empty the dirty water tank! After half a day of being in the trailer with out using excessive amount of water, the ""bath"" square over flowed. The owner Renae was severely rude and unhelpful! After me and my newborn baby had to leave and check into a hotel She refused to refund the remaining amount because we signed a ""contract"". There was no empathy for scamming us and setting us up. Not only did she said ""I don't care about losing you as a customer"" she also said ""there's nothing you can do because you signed a contract"". She's right, we signed a contract, but we CAN DO and ask other potential clients/ customers to do what's right by boycotting this scam."
3,1,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would. They rent substandard RVs complete with half full gray water tanks. I guess that stands to reason when the gas tank was barely half full... The queen bed was a joke, most of it hanging off the platform so not even 1 person could sleep comfortably, let alone 2. When I called to complain all I got was attitude from the owner (manager?) Renae. Stay away from this place. Spend your money elsewhere."
3,1,"This may be the worst company in the entire RV business. We rented an RV to go to a music festival and three days before we were about to leave we called to find out when the RV would be ready. It took the company two days to get back to us and the day before we were set to leave, they informed us that the RV that we had rented was in an accident. They did not offer any kind of reasonable alternative.

We paid almost double to have to rent an RV at the last minute from another vendor and they offered no reparation whatsoever. WOULD CAUTION YOU FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE."
3,5,"Between the facts that I see EVERY vacation and trip out of town as a hassle and even more so when I have to rent and drive a vehicle that isn't mine, its a miracle I can ever have a good time and relax. Its always nice when a company makes it just a little bit easier to do that and especially when the company is local and family owned. Mr. Nichols and his staff are attentive and really assured me at every step that they knew what they were doing and it was never an issue getting someone on the phone there, which seems to be a recurring problem these days. I can't say enough good things about this family business, proud to have them in the Valley."
3,2,"We were planning to rent from this company for our first RV trip. We paid our deposit and received an email of the contract. The contract was missing information so I emailed them to revise the contract. I never heard back from them or received a new contract. I tried calling and leaving a message too, but they never answer their phone. Our trip is in two week and it started to make me nervous. The fastest response I got from them was when I sent my cancellation email. Response within 10 minutes.

They are also a lot more expensive than the other RV companies. We cancelled our reservation and lost our deposit (which I knew in advance we would lose) but I think we'll have a better first time RV experience with a more responsive company."
3,5,"Buying a used vehicle - especially a motorhome - can be a tricky transaction. All the way from beginning to end, the AutoBoss team acted with integrity, honesty and professionalism. I flew in from Norther California to take delivery of the '01 Monaco Windsor 38' and the everything was just as described.  90-days + 4,000 miles later, I could not be more pleased with the RV and the entire transaction.
I just can't recommend the guys at AutoBoss enough...and no I'm not affiliated with and was incentivized to write this review - I'm just really happy!
Chris"
3,5,"Joe, Jerry and Nacho did a fantastic job with my auto detail and radio install. Absolutely outstanding! Highly recommend."
3,1,Not sure how these guys stay in business.  Looked at an RV today and was trying to determine how well it would drive.  Was told unless I was serious and put some money down you can't test drive the RV.  Too bad - just lost a sale because I liked what I saw!
3,1,"I wanted to take the time to advise prospective buyers on the experience we had at Auto Boss RV, in Mesa Arizona. Out-of-state buyers BEWARE. If you bring a rig back to California you will pay ""Road Use Tax"" on the FULL amount of the sale price. This means that ""Road Use Tax"" can not be deducted from your tax returns. SALES tax can. So the Sales tax that you pay Arizona will be deducted from the amount you will pay Cal DMV.

During the first test drive (that I was not allowed to test drive, which at that time we should have walked away from Auto Boss) I mentioned to Joe (salesman) that the ""Air Noise"" that was coming from the driver side that needs to be fixed. I was told that ""No problem that will be fixed"".  We also had noticed that during moderate acceleration the coach was jerking. Joe had said that he was trying to adjust his foot on the pedal. Ok, since I was not given the opportunity to test drive I could not say for sure that his comment was true. We also noticed during that first test drive, the right side (kitchen side) was not closing completely and was a gap large enough to fit my fingers in. The Info center was not working properly.

The day of taken ownership, the ""Air Noise"" and the ""R/H Slide"" was not fixed. The jerking I experienced on the ""Test drive"" and the drive back to Buckeye was still prominent during light pressure on the accelerator during lower speeds. The Info center was replaced.

The trip home was very enjoyable to drive in a monster this size. Very comfortable. The traffic was really bad that weekend, but made it home safely, despite the annoying Air noise from the driver's side. One of the most annoying issues of this coach is the ""Jerking"" at speeds 25-35 MPH. 

I contacted the Cat dealer and he said that this is a problem, but Cat motors inherently don't like that speed and to schedule an appointment to bring the coach in to be inspected. The Cat service center found several clamps that secure the rubber boots for the turbo system loose and causing ""lower turbo Boost pressure"". Two days of troubleshooting with several tests at a cost of $553.00 that Auto Boss should have covered the cost prior to delivery.

There was many issues with this coach that was promised to be fixed prior to delivery that was not, but to the owners credit (Andrew) did send Auto Glass Boss (no affiliation to Auto Boss RV) from Mesa, Arizona, to repair the five windows that were fogged. The air noise I discovered was caused by missing caps on the top of the outside mirrors. Go figure!

My recommendation to buyers is to be very cautious when buying a rig there. The owner is very personable and seams to be very sincere. Inspect the coaches with a very selective eye. If and when you get to test drive, ensure all issues are resolved prior to delivery. We have owned this rig now for 8 months at a cost of $7500.00 in repairs, parts and service (and counting).

Happy Shopping,"
3,1,"BUYER BEWARE!!! my husband and I are from San Diego we found a coach they had listed on rv trader we were interested in. Called and Talked to Joe got the financing information which threw up the first red flag. They know nothing about the financing and give you a # to a ""broker"" out of Florida. When you call its just a cell phone with a very unprofessional lady answering. So after getting my own pre approval through another credit union in AZ my husband requested some additional pictures of the engine and any flaws in the coach. Keep in mind now were already pre approved and willing to drive 6 hours one way to pick this thing up. Joe tells my husband he is working on getting the pictures and info we asked for together. Then out of no where Joe calls my husband and tells him that he is a F*****g D**K that our expectations are too high and no one at their dealership wants to make a deal with us. All we asked for was some pictures of the motor and any imperfections so we know what were driving 6 hours for. So after the call with Joe telling us they don't want to do business with us for absolutely no reason we called back and spoke to the owner. He apologized to my husband and told him that Joe was having a bad day and still had no interest in making a deal with us. Come to find out this place doesn't qualify to finance through credit unions. Also the way they acted was like they were hiding something and once we asked for more detailed pictures they didn't want to do business with us because we would find whatever they were hiding. I would stay away from this place. This is not how you treat customers."
3.5,4,"I popped into this place one Monday morning without being on the schedule.  They happily took me in, despite my failure to plan.  Gold Star!  I was truly grateful.  I own a pop-up, but know nothing about what it takes to maintain them.  Probably not the best idea I've ever had...but definitely feel more at east with Bell Road RV on my side.  They fixed it right up at a pretty good price and I was on my way up north by the weekend.  Four stars only because when I picked it up, the three parts guys sitting at the counter didn't offer to come out and assist in backing me up or hooking up my trailer.  I was in heels and a dress too, guess they figured it was too hot outside to move.  I don't blame them.  Will definitely be back if I need any other repairs, which I hope isn't too soon.  Thank you!"
3.5,5,Outstanding professional service!!! Treated me like a valued client. I will be back next time I'm in town and need of RV maintenance.
3.5,1,Parts department are a bunch of creeps who will ruin your day every time you have to deal with them. The service employees are mostly decent guys who try to help you with your problem. I got a sense each department hated the other as a service employee came out onto the sales floor to scold a parts employee because he was refusing to help a customer.
3.5,5,"We had a wonderful experience with Bell Road RV Center.  We were packing up our toy hauler the day before leaving on our trip, only to find our refrigerator was not working!  Phillip, the Manager at Bell Road RV Center took us in last minute at 3pm on a Friday and was able to get our refrigerator fixed and keep us on time with our trip!   We couldn't believe it!  Phillip and the service tech was so nice, professional, helpful and informative.  We are happy to know that we have a place we can go that will take care of us.  Typically they schedule and appointment with you in advance, so I think we had lucky timing, but they truly cared and made things happen!  This place really cares about the customer!  Thank you Phillip and Bell Road RV Center for saving our trip!"
3.5,2,"Took my 5th wheel in to have the axle flipped for better clearance took 3 full weeks for them to complete the work.  Called multiple times to follow up always promised to call me back with an update, never happened."
3.5,5,I was really impressed with how thorough these folks are. They don't miss a thing. They took the time to explain things to me and were very helpful. My go to for all things RV.
3.5,1,"Brought my damaged RV in before Labor Day for a quote. 4 weeks later, no quote after multiple follow ups. Never once contacted by BRRV except to respond to my inquiries. Always told ""still getting parts quotes""; what a joke, I had all the parts quotes from the OEM in 3 days.
Don't waste your time. Went somewhere else and was professionally taken care of.
MA, Cave Creek"
3.5,1,This is probably the most rude and obnoxious place I have dealt with in a long time. Our rv wouldn't start on a Saturday and AAA suggested we call these guys to have it towed there. Bad idea. When I called I got some jerk whose on comment was call back Monday and service would give me an appointment to be towed in. Really. Run from these guys as fast and far as possible. East Mesa Auto Coral was very accommodating about having it towed there to get it out of someone's parking lot.
4.5,5,"Made an appointment and took my rig in to have the water pump replaced in addition to 2 other minor maintenance items.  Was quite pleased with how straight forward and quickly things were done by Ryan in the shop.  He also kept me informed as to how things were progressing.

I should also mention Mike who in a previous visit tried to get my old pump working even though I didn't have an appointment that day.  First class attention!

Lastly, Jennifer at the reception desk was both business-like and quite pleasant."
4.5,5,These guys were great. On a long road trip and had a problem with my new Truma water heater on my LTV. I called them in the morning from Joshua Tree and they were able to get help me that afternoon. I had a coach full of kids and dogs and did not want to unload. They diagnosed the problem in the 100 degree heat and fixed the issue in 15 mins! They replaced the panel and we were on our way. Very thankful and would recommend to anyone looking for great service!
4.5,5,"Doug and I are owners of a 2015 Mercedes 3500 Sprinter, Roadtreck CS Adventurous with an Etrek Option (solar, inverter & enough extra batteries to get you off the grid). Recently, we had run into a problem with the 7.5 cu. inch Norcold (AC/DC) fridge working sporadically on our trips. Wagon Trail diagnosed & fixed the problem (with the support of tech folks at Roadtreck & Jim Hammill), but even more,  Ryan Fairman, 'tech extraordinaire', ""took us to school"" on how the elegant system works, and battery care. Thank you, Ryan-we are very appreciative of your taking the time to walk us through the workings of our battery system!"
4.5,5,Staff were very helpful here at Van City RV (Wagon Trail). They were very knowledgeable and had all of the Leisure Travel and Roadtrek models we wanted to see. They didn't mind us poking around for a couple hours and even turned on the air conditioning units in the RV's so we wouldn't burn up. They were also accepting of us bringing our dog & gave us bottled water too!
4.5,1,"Can't believe how bad the service was at their original place, now it's gotten worse, 6 hours of calls to a voicemail that didn't get returned until almost closing time.  When I took our RV in on Monday I was VERY SPECIFIC that we wanted it fixed.  No I don't want to chat about it, no I don't care if there's a warranty, FIX IT.  They were more worried about whether we had a ""warranty"" on the the A/C unit than actually fixing it, but didn't bother to call us for 3 days or Diometic for 4 days the same day we were to pick up our unit and the day it should have been completed.  

Do you think I looked like I couldn't afford a new A/C unit, and I think they were profiling me.  

I guess I should have been worried when they had none of our information in the their computer even though we have been here a few times for unsuccessful service and a purchase? 

This whole RV purchase in April 2014 was a comedy of Errors, from Noel's lack of communication with us to the outright lying about the features of the Unity Leisure.   Our bad for not double checking, but you would think the salesman would know his stuff and want to sell an RV to someone looking to buy.    

Any warranty work was constantly passed off to, it's not covered ""anymore"".  So much for the two year warranty. 

So overall, wouldn't recommend a purchase or a service here."
1,1,"DONT MOVE HERE!! If you want to sleep at night!!  People play there music so loud you can hear every word of it and have the bass so loud it makes it impossible to sleep!! There are times where the music is played so loud past 2am..No matter how many times you complain to management and call the police, nothing changes... Music still gets played loud. Having kids try and sleep through that is impossible. Find somewhere else to live people!!"
1,1,"This place actually deserves no stars. The new management is beyond atrocious! The spiked the rent to demolish the old homes. They have a mannequin as a receptionist ,because if you ask her for anything she can't help you and doesn't even know where to start. The price to rent is ridiculous for what they are offering. NO AMENITIES! You can barely have a piece of trash in your property before they send you a 5 day notice to clean up or get evicted. It's not even in a great neighborhood."
1,1,"Do noooottt!!! Rent here! They tow you for not moving your car in 3 days, for parking and the dirt, for fixing you car, basically anything. The rent is waay too much for a little trailer. The last manager got fired for stealing the rent money I had to find my old recipets jus to prove I paid. New manager you never see him. People leaving their homes cause it cost them more to maintain and pay towing fees. They are nice at first but once you rent they dont care for you. Poor management"
4,3,"This is a great military only RV park. A number of sites have large enough trees to provide shade for your RV. I had to give them 3 stars because their wifi is worthless, your better off using your cellular signal."
4,4,"This was our first stay at an RV park. 

The staff were incredibly nice. They led us to our parking spot, assisted with backing in and provided details about services. 

The park is very quiet (we loved that). However, the WiFi worked all of two minutes during our two day stay. For the most part, it wouldn't even allow you to connect. As a retired IT Tech, I expected a slow connection at the very least. The staff were aware. 

Beyond that, bring something to deal with the ants!"
4,4,"Fantastic large military RV park located approximately 10 miles from the strip or downtown.   The park offers full and partial hookups.  Most sites have concrete pads, although all partial hookups and 5 or 6 full hookups are compacted gravel/dirt.  Electricity very stable and reliable; water pressure extremely strong (make sure you use a regulator).  WiFi is offered but is extremely slow!  Main base, including commissary and BX, is across the highway, but very accessible.  Park is located directly behind Mike O'Callahan Federal Hospital."
4,5,This is my second time staying at this RV park and I must say... IT IS FANTASTIC!!! The staff is sooooo nice and super helpful. The park is clean and well maintained. LOTS of washer/dryers.... Clean shower facilities... And even a little fenced in dog park! I wish all RV parks were like this one!

4,5,"One of the best military rv campgrounds we've been to this summer.  Clean, friendly and helpful staff, free WiFi in older section of camp as repeaters still need to be installed in newer portion of camp. Newer section lacks mature trees but have full 50 amp hookups for less than older sites.
Bathrooms, shower, and laundry facilities are abundant, newer and very clean. 

They have a terrific large pet area, just beware of the Oleander trees. Also you can get a free bag of ice for each night you stay. Only negative is that they don't have weekly or longer rates. You can stay a few months but at the same daily rate."
4,5,"Was greeted by friendly staff (even got a complimentary bag of ice).  I had made a same day reservation and when I arrived,  they had a pull through slot available.  I was even escorted to my site and was waved in to the paved site.  I had plenty of room for a 30ft trailer and 20ft Truck, but there were much larger RVs in the area.  The site was leveled and connection points were well taken care of.  

The park was clean with some construction taking place on one side.  The bathrooms were clean and cool but a little rusty.  The showers had good pressure and hot water.  

Great place over all... highly recommend"
4.5,5,"Left a message when I initial called and received a call back shortly after.  Busy place but was in no hurry and they were booking appointments for the next week.  Provided a detailed quote over the phone which is nice.  Arrived on time and they got to work right away.  Professional, courteous and efficient.  Highly recommend!"
4.5,5,"10++  Richard and son are top notch in their customer service of detail to your problem. I had a bearing go bad on the freeway in Phoenix lasat summer.  Boat / trailer had to be flat bedded to house.   even though Lewis hitches could not do the work due to moblie work necessary, they still guided me to all the parts necessary.  Now it's a year later and i am trailering boat cross country.  Today Richard replaced bearings and went over all work done to ensure me of a SAFE journey.   I Thank you Richard!!!  Christine"
4.5,5,"I burned up a wheel bearing on my travel-trailer coming into Phoenix on my way home to LA.  I found Lewis Hitches on-line and liked what I saw in these reviews.  I couldn't be happier!  Not only did they take care of my wheel bearing problem, I showed them some other things I was concerned about - like a bent tow frame.  They fixed everything I needed, explaining with great patience as I asked a zillion questions (single woman traveling solo for the first time with first freeway breakdown), and did it in a timely manner especially considering that it was almost Thanksgiving.  I found their work to be quality work and the price extremely fair.  Eric made a point of showing me everything that had been done, how it worked and how to maintain it all in the future.  I would highly recommend them for any trailer work you might need to have done."
4.5,5,"Great customer service and price for installation of a gooseneck hitch on my 2003 Dodge Ram 2500. They were also able to install a spray in bed liner, during the job, which was SO convenient for me. I will definitely use their services again and recommend them without hesitation!"
4.5,5,These guys are the best. A breath of fresh air in the world of corporate-run auto repair rip off artists. They know what they are doing and do it at a reasonable price.
4.5,5,"I would highly recommend Lewis Hitches for all your towing needs. I needed to have a tow hitch installed on my Durango and after some research, Lewis's had one of the best prices. When on the phone they had great customer service and even addressed me by name when I walked in for my appointment. We discussed what all needed to be done and the estimated time it would take and I left my new car with them. I received a call an hour or so later and they had realized they had miscommunicated to me the estimate, as they had made an assumption about my vehicle. This change would bring the price we agreed upon, up. Needless to say, I was disappointed, but without hesitation, Lewis Hitches, took ownership for the mistake and gave me a great discount off what the new price was going to be. When I saw the finished product, I could not have been more happy. The hitch looked even better than we had planned and worked great for our camping trip that weekend. Thank you for such a great job Lewis Hitches! We'll definitely be back, when needed!"
4.5,5,These guys are great! Richard really knows what he is doing and the weld job they did on my trailer was really nice. They also used quality parts for the electrical work I had done. I couldn't be happier and I will always use these guys from now on!
4.5,5,"Simply the best trailer service shop I've ever run into.  Every time I have something done here I'm impressed with the service and care.  The owner always takes the time to explain everything he did in detail, and anything you need to know to follow up on.  Prices range from reasonable to surprisingly inexpensive.  Last time I had a set of brakes done they charged less for the parts than what I could find online.  When you make a reservation for service they take you right in and get it done fast."
4.5,5,"Great guys doing great work with great customer service!

They returned my email quickly with a good price, installed my new 5th wheel hitch a day after I contacted them, showed me the operation of the hitch, and willingly adjusted the height a few weeks later."
4.5,5,"Walked in with a very small custom welding job, walked out 15 minutes later with an awesome job done for a very reasonable price.  Very pleased with service and quality of work."
4.5,5,"Lewis hitches is AWESOME, blown away with great polite customer service. I recently have contacted them and spoke with Richard regarding possibly bent A-frame on my travel trailer. After talking with Richard he advise to bring it over to check it out. I live over 30 miles away and work Monday through Friday so it was hard to find a day to get it there but Richard explained he would be there on Saturday and would be able to check it out. I was able to come by and was greeted by Eric and Richard. They came out and inspected my trailer, frame and actual design of struture and advised what has happened was minor. They went under it and checked it with a level and flash lights and found no cracks or stressed metal. they advised that it wasn't really all that bad and I could tell they were honest and stand up professional fabricators. Talking with them I have total support of their expertise and would not hesitate to have them do any work i ever need from now on. They were both very polite and professional and that is hard to come by now days. I am going to and refer anybody I know to Lewis hitches as they also do much more things then fab work. If you have a trailer or truck I'm sure they can do what you need. I could tell they knew what they are doing and are there to help customers to best possible ways. Thank you for providing excellent service."
4.5,5,Above and beyond on customer service and steel fabrication skills. I am very happy with my custom hitch and motorcycle carrier. I would highly recommend Lewis Hitches to anybody looking to have a hitch installed on their vehicle.
4.5,5,Came in for a small weld job on my travel trailer.  The job was completed quickly and at a reasonable price.  They also went above and beyond my expectations with the advice and instruction provided.  Welds were perfect.  Good outfit that I highly recommended.
4.5,5,"I brought my car seat in for a weld repair on the bottom seat frame.  It was a small repair, but very difficult to get to because of where it was located underneath the seat.  The shop manager, Eric, didn't hesitate and agreed to do the repair.  It came out great and for a great price.  Eric is very courteous and professional.  Highly recommend!"
4.5,1,I purchased a hitch on Amazon and then called this place to ask if they would install. The guy was not very helpful and said they only install hitches if they sell it. We asked if he knew of anyone else in the area and he quickly said no. I will not be calling this place again for anything.
4.5,5,"Best service, Install, and follow up instructions. Eric and his team are extremely knowledgeable and experienced. They installed my Roadmaster nighthawk, invisibrake system with trickle charge, and blue ox bracket on my 2017 fiat. Eric took the time to show me in detail how everything works and answered every one of my many questions. Quick turn around time. I would not go anywhere else for service of this type."
4.5,5,"Had some scheduling issues at first but they got all straightened out. Juan and crew did an awesome job with my long list of issues I needed taken care of, including issues on 2 slides. I will definitely use this service again."
4.5,5,Juan was great and it was worth the wait as far as scheduling.  He is professional and thorough.  I highly recommend him since he is very straight forward.  It is nice to find a business that provides great customer service.
4.5,5,"Please let me start by saying, I have tried several RV centers before finding Juan, the owner of 4 Point RV Service.  Typically, going in as a woman,  some RV center's  predatory instincts to rip-me-off  come into play.  I have even been told that I need a new generator.  I know just enough to identify the fraud.  During my last attempt to have my generator fixed/second opinion by someone other than that first rip-off company(there twice, same repair) of which recommended an expensive and ""unnecessary"" fix;   BY THE LUCK OF A REFERRAL, I found Juan.  

Juan no more than opened the Generator lid and noticed a wire type item laying on the bottom of the casing and put the wire type item back on the generator and it started up. He then did the routine maintenance.  My older generator never ran better.  



Now a year later,  I have returned to Juan for further maintenance and minor repairs.  Juan is a knowledgeable, honest and professional gentleman.  I highly recommend Juan and 4 points RV Service."
4.5,5,"My first experience with Juan Romero was last fall, a few months before he quit his job to run his business full time. This review is more about his character than his work, although both are excellent. Juan was sent to me by an RV wash company whose worker stepped on my bath skylight requiring replacement. He called me to talk about the job and said he'd be by sometime to measure the skylight. Well, he showed up a couple of days later...on a Sunday...in church attire...with his family. To measure. He didn't have to do that but he did. When he finally got the skylight, he came back to install it...after he already worked 10 hrs...in the dark. Oh yes...he has a habit of showing up on time to do the work. Since it was dark, I was not going to climb on to the roof of my coach. So Juan took a picture of his work, explained the work he did, and showed how it looked. I was impressed. Really impressed. Needless to say he became my go-to guy, and remains so, when I have a problem with my coach. Absolutely recommend. I'm a full time RVer wintering in the East Valley."
4.5,5,"Arrived in Mesa for snowbird season and my refrigerator died.  I went on line to check reviews and Juan had the best reviews so I called him.  I explained my issue on the phone and he was very kind and listened to what I had to say.  He told me that he could not get to me for 2 days because of other customers and I totally understand due to all of the snowbirds flocking here for winter.
Juan came out and after 2 or 3 attempts at what I hoped were quick resolutions to my problem, it became clear that it was a cooling unit replacement.  :(
He was honest with me about the price and told me that he could order it on Monday and have it to install by Wednesday.  He did everything that he said and called me 1 hour ahead of our appointed time to see if he could come early and get it installed.
When he arrived I asked him if it was ok for me to watch so I could learn about my RV.  He not only said it was OK, but he explained some things to me as he and his helper were repairing it.

When I am in the Phoenix area, nobody but Juan will be doing the work on my RV.  I could not be happier with the outcome of my dilemma.   
THANK YOU JUAN"
4,4,"We love this Elks Lodge even though we aren't members of this location.  This Elks has it all.  Too bad the others don't use this one as an example.

The RV park in the back is well managed by their two hosts.  They do an amazing job and are constantly working to better the park.  Activities are planned and they are just about as friendly as can be with everyone.  We've not heard one bad comment.

The Lodge is open every day and serves meals or snacks.  Prices are very, very low and servers excellent.

However, they really need a little fenced area for the dogs.   Area should be fenced if dogs are allowed off leash.  Other than that -- great park.  One other thing that would be nice is good Wi-FI.   There is Wi-Fi to the RV park and the signal is excellent.  However, there is never any bandwidth.  We've never been able to use the one at the park so thank goodness we have our own..

For us, it is like a home away from home.  What else can I say .. it really is as good as it gets for an Elk Lodge!"
4,5,"Great people, and well run bar. They also have a kitchen with very good and reasonable priced food. Check out the 'Salsa, Big Band and Karoke Nights.' Great fun !"
4,4,"A friendly Elks Lodge with a fantastic camp ground! Full hookups w/30 & 50 amp electric, sewer & water, great location!"
4,2,Called the lodge for RV site availability and was told they had a site but to call the host which I did. I was told they had a spot but they don't take reservations. I drove over to the lodge and called the office from the parking lot and was told again that they had  a rv spot but to call the host to get the paperwork then bring it to the lodge with the payment. When I called the host I was told there was no rv spot so I asked to dry camp and was told there is no dry camping even though the elks rv book and their website state rv dry camping for $10. I wouldn't of driven out of my way had the website stated no dry camping. Not very happy with the Tempe RV Park. Merry Christmas
3.5,3,"We really like this daycare and always have felt that it was clean and safe.  They work great with my schedule and I appreciate the days I don't get charged for. My only concerns are that when my child entered the 12-18 month room I often find my child with a FULL diaper and is always getting sick or getting some sort of rash.  Mind you, we did not have this trouble previously.  I feel that kiddos are still allowed in when they are very obviously sick, causing other kiddos to continually get sick. I wish that rule was enforced a little more. Also, it seems as the rooms are way to full for teachers to handle. Also, although they say that kids are given water as often as they want, my childs' sippy is always full at the end of they day.  Makes me wonder if the water is ever offered or if my child is going all day with out a drink."
3.5,1,I usually don't ever post reviews on this because I think it's usually just people whining and complaining but I just had to post about my experience at children's safari. One of my friends took her kids here and just raved about the place so I thought I would take my 15 month old daughter there. It started off really good but then it just went downhill from there. I would pick my child up every day and her face would just be covered in snot. I mean all over her face. I said something about it but it didn't change. My daughter was always starving every time I picked her up. I over backed food for her to make sure she got enough but it was clear that she wasn't eating like she should be. The last thing is that they said she was biting. My big issue is she doesn't bite at home and I'm not saying she wasn't biting but if you are aware that she is biting wouldn't u watch her more? I would dread picking up my child every day. Then they kicked her out!! She has been at another daycare for this past week and hasn't have any issue what so ever. No biting. She sleeps and she eats. I really like the owner Kathy but I think it comes down to not probably training the women that are in the class rooms to probably care for the kids.
3.5,5,"Just wanted to update on Children's Safari.  I took my son out of daycare because I had left my job so I didn't need it anymore.  Well when I went to re-enroll my son the daycare was full at the moment.  So I had to take my son to another daycare that was affordable.  I found one in Chandler, and it was the same price range.  I had called other places, and they were WAY more expensive than Children's Safari. The one I found in Chandler was about the same price as Children's Safari.  This daycare in Chandler provided lunch, and you didn't have to pay when your child was out sick.  I thought it was going to be great. WRONG.  My son was in there two days and I vowed to never take him back.  The teachers would yell at the children (in front of me and other parents so who knows how they were after I left), were rude, and there was no security system in place.  When I got there peoples' information were sitting on the desk in a folder with social security, contact, address information, etc.  I was mortified. Anyone could just walk in and enter any of the classrooms.  Thank GOD, I got a call that Children's Safari had an opening when I took him out of the Chandler place.  I was BEYOND relieved.  Kathy provides a CLEAN environment, I have NEVER seen any questionable behavior by any of the teachers, it smells great (the other places I toured had a horrible old smell to it), and you can't get through the front door to the classrooms without a fingerprint and password.  I truly don't think you can find a better daycare.  Please try this daycare out.  You won't regret it."
3.5,1,"As a former employee I would have to say to not even apply or work here and I'll tell you why: First of all I applied to them form Indeed.com. The job ad said that the position was for a Preschool Aide, but when they offered me the position I was in the same room while I was getting trained but after that they change their minds and instead of being in the same room everyday I was a floater and was given a post it note which had me in different rooms everyday. Now I told Kathy during my interview that I enjoyed working with they older children, but after I got trained I was no longer and aide. They lied to me about what my initial position was going to be and set me up so that I would get frustrated with what I my position was and finally do something that would get myself fired. So if you want work here be prepared to apply for one position and get put in to a totally different one."
2.5,1,"This place was horrible.. will never stay here again. Unless you are willing to pay a nightly rate they put you in the back with people who are staying mthly. There was no room to get our camper in with all the cars parked on the road, everyone was on top of each other.. Stay away !!"
2.5,5,I stayed at KOA - Charlotte/Ft. Mill yesterday and I had a blast! This was my first time camping; we pitched a tent and everything. The women's bathroom/shower area was super clean and readily available. The bathroom/shower closest to our area was closed for renovations. The staff was friendly and helpful. We're planning to go back next week.  Thanks for making my stay awesome.
2.5,3,"PROs
- Convenient location.
- Cabins are clean and up to date.
- Lots are level for the most part.
- Surprisingly quiet given location.
- Pool, putt putt golf, and small playground.
- Grocery store,  package store within walking distance.
- Pet friendly with a pet area.
- Staff is very friendly and professional.
- Carowinds 10 minutes away.
- Canaan Zipline Tours 20 minutes away.

CONs
- Lots do not have fire ring but you're allowed to build a fire.  I kind of see that as a potential safety concern. 
- Lots are small compared to other camp grounds.
- Not a true family camp ground given the are no scheduled activities,  no game room.
- Deluxe cabins are attached so you can hear visitors next door while inside the cabin.
- People ignore the no pets allowed sign in the pool and park area.
- The pool area has only 2 tables; one has an umbrella.  We counted only 14 chairs.
- The ""grill"" that is supplied to the cabins is a charcoal type grill you would see in state park.  It's not a propane grill. 
- You can't get propane refills at this camp ground."
2.5,2,"This park is subpar. First the good: convenient to everything. There is a Publix supermarket right next door. The bad: the park is right behind a gas station, bar and liquor store, so lots of traffic out front. Next, in the back someone has a construction company with access through the park. So all day long there is traffic through the park of non campers. We were parked on this road and it was almost like facing a public street. The park is old, poorly laid out and rough around the edges. Most of the sites are not level. Our power went out several times during our stay."
2.5,1,"Not at all impressed.  I am surprised it hold the KOA franchise name as a matter of fact.  NO security whatsoever!  No gates. We are here now - week of the Fourth of July.  Bathhouse closed ""for renovations"" but no workers to be seen. Check in is the gas station next door with attached bar. Yes bar - no one under 21 allowed.  The other end of gas station is a liquor store. We were given a site number - when we get to the site it appears to be 4 sites in one. Really only space for our 5th wheel. Not long enough or wide enough for your vehicle too. Luckily - the place was ""dead"" so therefore you can ""use"" all 4 sites. We weren't exactly sure we were looking at the site correctly once we backed in - so tried to call the gas station front desk - automatic answering machine pickup. So pull back down to ""office"" to discuss our concerns and ask they go with us to make sure we are looking at the site properly and are setting up in the right place. It  was 12 noon Was told the employee that helps with this will be in at 12. The lady is working the gas station and campground alone.  But fortunately the employee did arrive just a few minutes after 12 - no biggie - we all run late some days.  He follows us to the site - and sure enough the way we were going to set up earlier would have taken all 4 sites.  When he located our site - it was very unlevel and not even long enough for our camper. So we asked to move to a different site.  One behind where we were. We needed to make sure the site was available (no reservations). Called the office - but of course went to automatics answering machine. So he said she is working alone and he would go see if the site was available. A few minutes later he returned, upgraded us to a concrete pad spot with no additional charge.  Still not level and only enough room for camper and 1 vehicle. 
Pool was nice and large. Play ground in direct sunlight - so you CANNOT play here in the summer time - metal in the south in the summer can be brutal to your skin.  The pool and play area appear to be safe - gated with a key pad - and signs that visitors must have wrist band. But, the lock was duct-taped so it wouldn't latch - no code needed and no wrist band. Has a nice pool snack shack - but this was not opened.  
The campground is very clean and appears to have at one time been pretty busy - but no more.  As I said we were here for the 4th and we were the only ones in the pool."
2.5,2,"So- we are campers.  And by campers, I mean we have an awesome pull behind 34 ft trailer that suit us all just fine.  Some would call it ""glamping"" but whatever.  We have never stayed at a KOA, but we're optimistic, paid the $30 to become members, and started a new relationship.  I had to go to a week long class in Charlotte, and needed to stay somewhere that wasn't $100+ a night, since I was footing the bill for this trip.  We were able to get a site here on the fly- which was good!!  The lady on the phone was very nice and pleasant.
The campground itself was a little odd.  The sites were sort of funny- in the middle- they were all stacked up on top of each other.  They did upgrade us to a concrete pad- which was nice, but like the other folks that reviewed stated- there isn't much room for vehicles, and there was no fire rings- weird.
You DO have to check in at the gas station across the little road (that is attached to a bar- that stays pretty busy for a gas station bar, and a liquor store), but the Publix (best grocery store in the world!) across the way was exciting.
I thought it was very nice and helpful that the KOA guy that checked us in, got into his KOA little jeep thing and showed us the way to our site.  ITs a good thing he did, b/c my husband almost clipped a tree not paying attention to the back of the camper.
Since I was there a whole week, i got to see how most folks that stay there only stay for a night or two.  At least on the side WE were staying.  On the other side of the fence, it looks like people are LIVING there.  Full time living there. Is that a thing? Can people do that?
There is a $30 rental fee (refundable) to hook up to the cable.
There is also wifi (the reason for the 2 star review).  The wifi shows a full signal, but it's terrible!  Poor me- no wifi while I'm camping- but the problem is I was there for a CLASS and had to do tests and studying for several hours a night.  On the first day when I couldn't get online with their ""free wifi"", I had to up the data for my cell phone and just use it as a hot spot.  Went through about 3 gigs the whole week.  If you're using the free wifi as a selling point- please make sure it works!

We will give KOA another shot- but probably not this one.  The traffic in this area is out of control.  Like INSANE.  The traffic was so bad, i didn't even venture to any restaurants in the area, b/c I was afraid that I couldn't make it back across the street with all 4 lanes blocked all morning and all evening.  Cereal for dinner is good though, and this Publix has an incredible wine selection :)"
2.5,4,"This KOA is not your typical ""camping"" destination, but if you're looking for a place to stop for the night it is a great place. RV spots are wide enough for 2 full slides and all hookups available. There are great amenities within walking distance (Publix, QT gas, Hardee's, and a Mexican food truck). There is also a Valero gas station conveniently located so you can fill your tow vehicle up before hitching. Attached to the Valero gas station there is a local bar and pool hall with darts, friendly company, and great beers. Although the campsite is close to a main road, the fence surrounding the KOA keeps the noise down to a minimum. There are also great activities for the kids to enjoy, a sandy bottom park, mini golf, and a seasonal pool. Looking for some rollercoasters... Carowinds is less then 10 minutes away! Overall a good KOA experience despite previous reviews!"
2.5,1,"I'm only giving it one star because it's required!!!!! WORST KOA EVERRRRR!!! Where do I begin? The pool that's closed for the season when it's 90 degrees outside? It's september 18th... (also one worker said it was opened when we called and when we got to the pool we called and they said it was closed) we got a long term spot ($600 a month) we asked for a different spot and they told us it was only for people stopping by for the night, but there is campers here that's been here long before us. The cable that doesn't work? We have had spectrum come out twice and still no cable (KOA's fault) your laundry room that smells like feces. Or should I talk about the game room that doesn't have any working games. Someone stole our grill that was outside. Oh and if they don't feel like filling your propane... they won't. we asked for a propane fill and they said it was going to rain... (not a cloud in the sky) we drove by 30 minutes later and they were filling someone else's. I wouldn't let my worst enemy stay here even if they paid me. we've stayed at dozens of koa's and quite frankly I wouldn't piss on this one if it was on fire."
2.5,4,Great location and our 3 dogs loved it. They had plenty to do with trails and a fenced area.  Cabin we rented was cute plenty of room for what it was and we loved it. Cabin toilet had a leak around bottom and light over sick didn't work but everything else was great. Very friendly and safe area
3.5,1,"VERY expensive for what it is, because it isn't much.

When we first drove in to the campground my immediate impression was of a tired, worn out property.

Our site was an extremely small area next to the office with a number of sheds behind us.  The water, electric and sewer were fine however, our internet did not work at all.  We were told there were computer problems that day and they'd reset it.  After about 30 minutes my husband called Angie again to say the internet still wasn't working.  He got her voicemail and left a message, she never returned his call.

Luckily we only committed to one night, I couldn't wait to get out of there."
3.5,4,"We have been staying for multiple nights in the springtime for three years now. 

The Covered Wagon looks better than it ever has. 
It is retro.
It is small.
It is what we like.
There are several long term occupants. Yea! Boo! 
 Yea, they know the area and are helpful. They are not the nosey Good  Sam types who give unsolicited advice. 
 Boo! It means there is not always a selection of spots to choose from.
This place is very well located for our needs in Phoenix. 
 The neighborhood is safer today than it was three years ago. Be street  wise. Carry a large dog on the end of a leash.
Angie manages the place and is very pleasant and acommodating. She may  have a hard time saying no to RV'rs without reservations. She does a  great job on keeping the place clean.


My wish.
 I wish the owner would purchase adjoining lots and expand/ remodel the  whole park.
 Build a new multipurpose building with showers and laundry and Tiki Bar  next to the pool. This could also act as a managers home/office.
 Add spaces in the same direction to each row headed north. 
 Put a wall up on the north end.
 I would pay $10.00 a day more for a new and improved Covered Wagon  RV Park.
 Although I love the landscaping, the reality is that water thirsty plants,  lawns are on their way out. Replace with stamped concrete and astro- turf.

We will come back."
3.5,4,"We came to Phoenix for a short visit with family. The Covered Wagon RV park was close to where we needed to go. Angy was very friendly when I spoke to her on the phone earlier in the day of our arrival. She followed up with a text mesaage letting me know what type of spot was available and answered any additional questions I had while we were still driving. She met us upon arrival and directed us the easiest way to get to our spot and also helped us get situated into the spot. Angy was headed out to dinner when we arrived and had no problem letting us take care of the registration part once she returned and also once we returned from getting dinner. The park was well kept, although some people did not pick up after their pets, someone had gone around and picked up the stray dog poop. There are trash cans for each site instead of one dumpter for the whole park, which was nice. Each site has a cement pad as well as some grass. The site we were in had nice shade on both sides of our trailer. The park was quiet, considering the I-17 is just on the other side of the wall. The grass in the park was well maintained also. We did not use the pool or laundry facilities so I can not give any feedback on those. The only downside to this place is there isn't a gate separating the park from the street (general public). And the office is on the opposite end of the park from where you enter, so any Joe Shmo can just walk in (or drive in) off the street. There is really no way to control who belongs in the park and who doesn't."
3.5,5,"A grassy oasis in the desert! This is a wonderful park with friendly, accommodating staff and a cool pool. They even have a vending machine with cold candy bars! Every site has a bit of grass, and most have at least a little shade. 
It is in a latino neighborhood, so racist people might feel uncomfortable."
3.5,4,"Had to go to Phoenix for doctor appointments and got to Phoenix kind of late and saw this RV park was close by on my smartphone.  The manager, Angie, was able to give me an overflow site and even helped me back up into it with my travel trailer.  They were very busy but she was able to let me stay there for two weeks while I took care of my medical care.  The park is rather small but very cozy and comfortable.  There are lots of trees and lawn.  There are a number of long terms people staying there apparently  and I had the chance to visit with a number of them.  There were very friendly and funny and dog friendly folks.  The park has a fantastic location, being just off the freeway but also close to a huge dog park, good shopping and restaurants.  Cement walls all around helped keep the noise level very comfortable.  The Wi-Fi was better than many places I have visited.  And last but not least, the bathrooms and laundry were very nice.

When I come back to Phoenix, I will stay there if possible."
3.5,5,"This review is a little late but I have nothing but great things to say about this place. We found this RV park just by chance the moment we got into town for Super Bowl weekend. We drove all the from Puyallup,WA to Phoenix. We called ahead of time to make sure they had space for us. She told us that we would be in the over flow parking area. We were ok with that. We just needed somewhere to park our RV. When we arrived she ended up parking us right next to the restrooms and we were able to hook up everything. They have shuttle service 24hrs for you. For a small fee, they will pick you up and drop wherever you need to go. Sure the park is in a sketchy neighborhood but we had no problems at all while we were there. Angy, the manager was amazing!! She took really great care of us. If you need an RV park to stay at, I really recommend this RV park. They have great customer service and the restrooms are always clean and stocked. If we take an RV road trip to Phoenix, we will definitely stay here again. Oh they even gave us some grapefruit to take home with us!! :)"
3.5,1,My son's bike was stolen right next to our trailer. Everyone parked their bikes next to their rv so we thought it would be fine. There is NO gate separating this place from the street heading towards the freeway(which you can hear traffic all night long) and there was an entire wall broken down connecting the very run down apartment complex to this place.  Key for vandalism. Showers were nice but the price for this place was NOT worth it.
3.5,1,"This RV Park was horrible! We got to this park at dusk but could tell it was a run down place. We do a lot of RVing but had never been to Arizona and found this spot on the web. My husband took our dog out of the park and was approached by some low life guys that he feared for his life with. The man next to our spot was racist and mean. 
This park was one of the most expensive parks we've ever stayed in and was the worst one we've ever stayed in.
This place is bad inside and outside and we will never go anywhere near it again.
The only thing decent about this place is the manager Angie. I wish she had been rude so that we had never gone there."
3.5,4,"Nice RV park. Lots of trees.  Most spaces are shaded. Good size spaces. Park was well kept. Clean restrooms and pool.  Fair rates. Lots of rules, but I'm sure that is what keeps the park clean.  We were only there for a few days for work. Would return for sure."
3.5,1,"Your contentious response supports all my claims;
1. In contrary to your lie, the referral shop has no space for larger vehicles but continues for 21 years to service our personal autos.
2. We have pics of all the problems from your repairs.
3. After removing your company from any dealings with the insurance company, we received complete compensation and are satisfied with their service."
3.5,5,"All Pro Fleet Painting provided A+ service with outstanding prices.  The staff was friendly and personable, starting with Julie J. in the front office, to the manager Ryan S., on up to the owner himself Dan D., who took the time to come out and greet us personally.  All Pro is simply that ""all professional"".  They started working on our vehicle immediately after drop-off and it was finished within the estimated time frame.  I highly recommend All Pro for your collision repair and painting, whether for your personal vehicles or business fleet vehicles."
3.5,1,"All Pro was suppose to repair my vehicle thru the at-fault person's insurance company after an accident. Not only was the repair poor quality (they blamed their inferior work on the previous repair but we have pics showing it was correct before the accident) also bad mouthing the body shop that repaired the vehicle previous even though that is who referred us. They also directed the appraiser to not take responsibility for all the damage stating it was not caused by the accident. After I talked with the insurance company's supervisor it was apparent to him that it was a legitimate claim. They got paid in full and refuse to compensate for the following issues:

1. The hood is not aligned, one side is flush and the other a 3inch gap.
2. The hood is so out of alignment they could not make it latch so removed it, and told me      ""you really don't need it, semi trucks don't have hood latches"".
3. The drivers door is not in alignment and has a big gap at the bottom.
4, The three rubber pieces are missing from the bumper.
5, There is a long crack in the new hood and the edges are broken off.
6. The headlights rubber housing was not reinstalled correctly and water is able to get in.
7, My ice chest is missing.
8. They returned the limousine to me with no power to the back accessories.
9. They refused to do an alignment which we got paid anyway from the insurance company.

All Pro was very unprofessional and disrespectful when corresponding with me and made it extremely difficult in getting all the repairs done that were damage from the accident. They sided with the insurance company on every point but once they were removed from  negotiations and I dealt direct we were fairly compensated."
4,5,We had a picnic here with a group from church and we had an absolute blast. The owners were very kind to us and extremely accommodating. It was a super rainy day and the lifeguards had left but when our kids expressed interest in swimming the owner sat out in the rain to lifeguard until one of the lifeguards returned. We are so thankful for their kindness and because of them being so accommodating to us we were able to have a blast even though the weather was crummy.
4,5,"Loving the lake.  We bought campsite after trying it a couple times last year.  The new owner is fixing it up for more fun and safety.   We will be spending most of our summer here on our staycation.  

Oh and be sure to try the burgers and Wings - Kids all time favorites there."
4,1,"I have been camping at state and private campgrounds my whole life and was never treated the way I was here.  The owners micromanaged and changed the rules constantly, they overcharged for electric, you had to pay to take a shower and more. It was my husbands and kids first camper camping experience and it was so bad that my husband said he would never go camping again and put the camper up for sale and the kids do not even want to go back. We paid for the whole season and we were kicked out for wanting to sell our camper. Not the experience I had as a kid, it was very disappointing."
4,5,Good life is a great park with a lot of ammenities.. it's kept up nice and always fun things going on.. Park managers are great and so is all the staff..  I did one winter and loved it..
4,2,"The turn into the resort and the turns throughout the resort are tight.  It doesn't help that they have parking on one side of the road.  When we checked in, we were given a 24-page rule/regulation book.  We were also given a nametag that we had to keep pinned  to our shirt whenever we were in the park.  I wasn't too happy about that.  I don't like putting holes in my clothes.  The site tilts towards the street, so we had to use leveling blocks under our front wheels.  We had problems with our water and electric, and found out later that several people have the same problems.  When we tried to hook up the utilities, the electric didn't work.  We called the office.  By the time someone came to help, my husband had played around with it and had gotten it working.  Two days later, the electricity went out again.  This time my husband couldn't get it working.  We had someone from maintenance come out, and he managed to get it on.  A couple of days later, we had no water.  Three phone calls and almost an hour and a half later, the manager came to look at it.  He had no tools.  We had to hook up our water hose to the neighbor's pedestal.  The next day they got our water going.  During the two months we were there, we had a few more power outages and more problems with the water.  The office closes at 4 pm.  If you have a problem after that, you have to call the guardshack.  There's not much they can do since the maintenance men are not on duty, and the manager doesn't have any tools.  Needless to say, we will not return to this park."
4,4,"I just moved here recently and I am really enjoying it.  Activities every day except weekends, so really no reason to be bored.  All the residents and staff are super friendly and helpful.  
The only negatives are some of the older models of homes are quite small, so an Arizona Room is advisable if you need space and the houses (Mobile Homes) are quite close to each other.
I am only giving  4stars because this is the first mobile home park, I have ever really lived in."
4,5,"I was in my RV looking for a park to stay the night and didn't want just any where. It was over 100 outside and so I got on line and found this place listed. It had the slogan ""come to play, come to stay"" well it is Arizona...land of tons of retirees but I didn't put the two together. It looked awesome on the internet so I called and made reservations that I'd be there shortly. The lady was super nice on the phone and so off I went. It was about 4:30 in the afternoon and I was in no mood to keep looking for a place. I drove in and discovered it's a 55 or better place. Oops I'm not that old. The lady I spoke with on the phone was in the office and she said I could stay there anyway since it was just a night and just me. Awesome!! Well this place people stay for winters, months at a time but they have a daily rate of about $45 a night. Pool, hot tubs, club house, laundry facilities, golf course, social events and I'm sure I missed some stuff but it was great just to jump in the pool in that heat. I think I shocked some of the men there in my bikini and interupted a wine and cheese  party.
It was quiet and close off the freeway like an oasis waiting for me. I would tell anyone coming in the area to check this place out. I felt fortunate to be allowed to stay there...even for the one night."
2,4,"I'm actually really surprised by all the negativity this place has received. Is this the Taj Mahal of RV parks? Not at all. Do you get exactly what they state you will? Yes! What did you expect for $150/week?!?!  

This is the second time we have stayed at Road Runner in our 33' coach. We have never had any issues. This is not an on-strip location and does not claim to be. It is, for the most part, a quiet park that is out of the way.

I have dealt with 2 ladies at the front desk and both of them were incredibly kind. One reviewer was offended by being asked what year their RV was. Well, in the 2 years I have been full time in my coach, almost every park asks this. Get over it. If that is all it takes to offend you, it is probably rather difficult to please you.

Bottom line...we saw no sketchy behavior inside the park. We saw security patrolling every night. If you are an intelligent, able-bodied adult, you should have no issues."
2,1,"I just called this place they have a year restriction on what year your RV is. She wanted to know what year my RV is, I don't care if they were to give me a spot for free, I would not stay there. The lady didn't seem too happy that I have a 2005 Class-C RV."
2,3,"Thought we'd give this place a try upon recommendation from camping friends.  Full hook ups @ $16.00/night for first 2, then $20.00/night is the special right now.  Or $112.00/week for 37' which is good, but then additional charge depending on electricity used.  Not a high charge, but I don't want to have to worry about conserving.  That's what dry camping is for.  Anyways, we got an upfront spot facing Boulder.  Close to a lot of your regular neighborhood shopping; Walmart, Rite Aid, your usual fast food, plus Sam's Town, Arizona Charlie's and Boulder Station.  Usual noises, cars, trucks, sirens, helicopters.  Gal at front desk very accommodating, laundry $1.00 wash, $1.00 for 55 min. dryer time.  Skipping the showers, bathrooms and pool.  Of the few people we came across, friendly.  Mostly full-timers here.  Park seems well kept, but no security.  Seems like there should be since most rigs are left unattended, but there's probably a lot of regulars and they watch out for each other.  Would come here again next year.  Nice exploring this side of Vegas."
2,3,"Its pretty affordable place. You stay for under $400 a month + Electricity. 
I stayed here with my Travel Trailer for 2 weeks. 

They have OK management. Remember.. they ONLY TAKE CASH! (kinda annoying)

18 min drive from the main strip.. (Paris Hotel)

The pool is ok.. Have laundry.. 

Water is Horrible! Taste bad and have lots of calcium in it. 

A lot of full timers here...

All in all.. if you looking for cheap stay.. I think this is the way to go.. If you want more luxurious stay at the Oasis..  But. this place is not bad for the money..."
2,4,"I'm also surprised by the negative reviews. The 2 women in the office are very nice and very professional.  The park itself is not be the best area of las vegas but the rv park is safe (they have security) residents that walk property which is nice and every one is very friendly. Approximately 20 mins to strip and close to  2 nice casinos. (Sam's & Boulder Station) stores and plenty of restaurants. Park has 3 laundry rooms, 3 showers/restrooms builing which are kept clean & park is maintained and Rates very are reasonable.."
2,3,"$18/night FHU for first 3 nights and $22/night after that. They do have weekly and monthly rates. Although sites are small, 75% of them are pull throughs at same price as back ins. CASH only. No credit cards. 

Park felt safe and secure. No seedy characters. Had plenty of long term people but seemed like people from construction who came home from work and were quiet at night. 

Nice laundry room and showers. Pet friendly at NO extra charge.

Overall for our needs it was close to places we needed to go and two casinos nearby and also the Longhorn Casino for old small town vegas feeling. 

Would have given them 5 stars but no wifi. 

Front office (Cookie) was not exactly warm and friendly but she was professional. Manager was a lot nicer."
2,1,"Made a reservation last night.  They asked how much my dogs weighed.  I was honest.  All of them weigh less than 30 pounds.  Collectively they weigh 33 pounds.

This morning they threw me out because I have 3 dogs.  Why didn't this come up before I parked and set up??"
4,5,"My very first time renting an RV. I was very nervous, but it was a great experience. Daniel explained everything thoroughly and sent us on our way feeling confident that we would be taken care of should anything go wrong.
Nothing did, we had a great time, and a quick return process.
Some great things about this place: 
1. They don't inflate prices for festival or holiday weekends. 
2. The don't nickel and dime you (...for example, we cleaned up as best we could given the situation, and they didn't stress about it even though it wasn't perfect)
3. Their prices are really reasonable, and they only have a three day minimum.
4. They are incredibly friendly and great to work with."
3,1,"DO NOT RENT FROM CRUISE AMERICA!!!!!!  Poor Product and even Worse Support!!!   It took 21 HOURS to get a tow truck after breakdown.  Full story below.

First I'll address the Product.  We arrived to pick up our large rental at 1:00pm yesterday July 13, 2017 in Houston, TX. We did our walk around and there were large scrapes down the side of the vehicle, and internally there was still trash from prior renters.  There were a few other small cosmetic issues inside, but all was documented on our rental agreement.  When we started up the vehicle the check engine light was on, so the manager came and plugged in the unit for diagnostics and told us it was a loose gas cap, and the light was cleared, so we took the RV to our home to pack.  While packing the Generator had difficulty starting and staying on, but we weren't too concerned because we planned on plugging in at our final location so we could overlook a faulty generator.  We left Houston just before 4:00pm on July 13, 2017. While driving down the road I would have to hold the steering wheel at a 45 degree angle and fight the horrible misalignment.  You could almost make a 90 degree turn by just taking your hands off the wheel.  Also while driving the roof hatch would fly open because the lock was missing.  At 5:50pm, we decided to stop at a gas station to fill up before passing through San Antonio. As we exited I-10 the RV completely DIED. We restarted and died again about 3 times before finally making it into a gas pump. I thought maybe it was bad gas from sitting at rental place, so we filled up and tried to start again, and same problem. We were able to start/die multiple times to get away from the pump and coast to back end of parking lot and we contacted Cruise America Support around 6:00pm, and that's when the real fun with customer service starts.

In regards to Service, after that first contact to get a tow truck out, they called me back and asked if I could manage to drive the vehicle 5 miles down the road.  I explained the stop/start issues and that my wife and I had our 5 year old and 7 year old with us and driving down a major road that had no shoulder didn't sound safe, so I would prefer a tow.  She said that she would leave a note for her replacement in the morning to work on finding a tow truck because she hadn't had any luck reaching any tow trucks.  Keep in mind, it is 6:15pm and we are on I-10 in Texas with tow trucks going in and out of the gas station as she's telling me this.  I questioned what time I could expect to heard from the next agent and was told 9am!!!!!  Yes, 13 hours later I would get a call back to let me know they would start looking for my tow truck.  Let me remind you I have a large RV broken down in South Texas with  a 5 year old and 7 year old and a generator that keeps quitting and internal temps rising due to a poor generator/ac but it was perfectly acceptable to wait 13 hours to schedule a tow truck.  Since we had no alternatives, we basically set up camp in a gas station parking lot and slept through the night.  In the morning, there was no call.  I had to call in to remind them to call a tow and then would contact them every hour to get an update.  Each time I called they would tell me they were really busy and would call me back once they had a chance to review our options, but no return call would happen.  In fact, other than the initial call back right after the breakdown, I did not get any return calls for almost 18 hours into the process.  Around noon I received a call from the first truck that was dispatched because he decided Cruise wasn't going to pay them enough to sit through the traffic to Tow me so he left after already being in route.  Again, I had to contact Cruise to let them know their dispatched tow driver cancelled and they would need to find another.  21 hours after we broke down, a tow truck finally arrived and proceeded to tell me he was contacted by the other tow driver and after hearing our story came as quick as he could.  He literally arrived within 25 minutes of us getting our automated call saying a tow was dispatched.  He was the only good service experience we had in this entire event.  

In addition to taking nearly a full day to get us a tow, Cruise would not arrange for my family to be transported so I had to call and arrange transportation for my wife and children so I could ride with the RV to sign all the forms when dropped at mechanic shop.  Since Cruise America would not provide another RV and the maintenance shop wasn't going to look at it that day, we decided to rent a 15 passenger van (again arranged on our own) and emptied all the contents of our RV and drove back home. Cruise recommended we terminate our contract since we were leaving the RV and that would cancel our liability, otherwise I would have been required to stay with the RV at the shop until looked at. STAY AWAY!!!! DO NOT RENT FROM CA!!!"
3,1,"If I could give them zero stars I would. Terrible customer service. The RV they gave us broke down on the second day of our trip and it was a Sunday. Oh sorry it's Sunday we can't help you until tomorrow. Just stay where you are (an unknown area at a gas station off the highway) and call us back tomorrow and we'll arrange something.  I am so disgusted with this company. They left my family in an unsafe situation that has cost us over $2000 more than we expected because we had to make alternate plans. Then they are trying to blame us for the 90,000 mile used RV breaking because we drove 600 miles in one day instead of the alleged maximum 400 miles per day. No one ever told us of this alleged 400 max rule and it is not written anywhere in our rental agreement.  They are saying we may have to pay the $1000 deductible. They are in for a fight because I want a refund. I will pay for the one day we were able to use the RV and no more! Renter beware! I hope this helps another family avoid the same misery we went thru on our vacation."
3,1,"ANY PARTICULAR REASON WHY CRUISE AMERICA IS NOT ON BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU'S ACCREDITATION?! CEO OF CRUISE AMERICA PUTS THE LIVES OF ITS CUSTOMERS AT RISK! DO NOT CARE FOR THE SAFETY OF ITS PATRONS!! DO NOT RENT! WASTE OF MONEY! SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE A NICE VACATION!!! 

Cruise America left me in tears...literally!! my husband and I rented an RV from the Alum Rock San Jose location two days ago so that we can take our 23 month old son to Disneyland  for the first time. Once we hit the road, one hour into our trip, the air conditioner stopped working. So we called the customer service number and spoke to Elena who apparently is the catcher for ALL calls, she takes the information down and relays it to an agent. We informed the agent lucas about our problem and he was helpful in attempting to resolve the problem by sending us to Fairway Ford in Placentia to get it diagnosed and fixed. Russell at Fairway Ford tested out the air conditioner by running the generator that WE pay for by the hour to find nothing wrong with it! not to mention, left us with NO gas! I had to wait in the hotel with our son while my husband had to take time from our son's Disneyland time to go get this taken care of. 

In the middle of our day at Disneyland, Kara called to inform us that the dealership found no problem with it and that we MUST return the rental car IMMEDIATELY! We contacted Hertz and they said don't worry about it, bring it back tomorrow. So we got it back, and initially the A/C was working en route to San Diego to for Sea World which was 100 miles from Anaheim. 

Onwards to San Diego, the A/C stopped working AGAIN.....the problem was intermittent. So we were proactive, and called the customer service number again to inform them that the problem returned, and that we were headed to a Ford Dealership in San Diego to have them diagnose it. Once we arrived we were greeted by an angel Jennifer at Mossy Ford who was the Service Manager, and before turning off the RV, we had her witness the problem and sure enough, she recognized there was something wrong immediately. Not to mention, there was hot air coming out from the floor vents. Our son is only 23 months old, he gets grumpy when it's too hot...we were sweating in the cabin! Once we got in touch with Kara again at Cruise America, she told us that we had to wait an hour for the dealership to diagnose the problem!! An hour at a dealership with a 23 month old running around!!! Kara said the diagnose would ONLY take ONE HOUR, when the Service Manager (as helpful as she was) told us it would take at least 2-4 hours! I told Kara to explain to our son that we weren't going to make  it to Sea World today because we have to wait for the RV to get fixed! Kara expressed ZERO COMPASSION, ZERO UNDERSTANDING! She said she had to follow protocol. Cruise America would not authorize a rental vehicle for us until the RV got diagnosed....so I asked her, what if it took 3-4 hours?! She said it should only take 1! So, I hung up on her and called the corporate office in MESA, AZ to speak with Mr. Smalley, the CEO of Cruise America. Sabrina, the RECEPTIONIST, said I cannot speak with him, all complaints go to an Email address, there is not even a phone number...just the 1-800 number that we keep calling and the same person who picks up! 

I was so upset, that I spoke to them in tears.....the fact that NOBODY at Cruise America cared for the well being of its customers is beyond comprehension. The people they employ are heartless and won't think outside the box to help us! We have a 23 month old son, and I asked Kara to show some compassion and that I needed to speak to a supervisor or manager, she responded with, we don't escalate calls. So for all mechanical problems, it's the customers fault...

I WILL NEVER RENT, NEVER RECOMMEND, NEVER MOUTH THE WORDS ""CRUISE AMERICA"" AGAIN SO LONG AS I LIVE. They DO NOT CARE IF THEY PUT YOUR LIVES IN JEOPARDY, THEY ALLOW THEIR AGENCIES TO RENT OUT THEIR RV IN THE POOR, UNSAFE CONDITION THAT THEY ARE IN WITH ZERO CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR LIVES!"
3,5,"Rented an RV for a week to Grand Canyon and Sedona. Granted it took about 30 min to get our unit (but there was a major event going on and the staff was a bit overwhelmed). Once we checked in, the staff was extremely pleasant and the RV super clean. Would highly recommend renting from them."
3,5,"This was the drop off end of our Denver to Phoenix trip. Again the staff were super friendly, Chance recommended a placed for us to hangout that was great for the kids and then when it was time to drop the RV off the whole process was pleasant, smooth and painless. Frankly the Uber to the airport took longer to arrange!"
3,1,"Awful experience with the company!!!!!!  RV was in terrible condition.  When we returned the RV to the Spokane, WA the employees refunded the wrong credit card and they will not fix the issue.  I am out $258.00 because of their employees laziness!!!!!!  Find another place to rent from.  You can not talk to anyone in customer service only through email.  What kind of customer service is that?  If I could give a negative rating I would!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,2,Had an appointment to pick up RV at 1 pm....they didn't have our size cleaned yet. We waited 1 hour & 45 minutes....what? There was no option offered to us to upgrade from the parking lot FULL of other ready RVs. The manager lady needs to be trained on good customer care. I am renting from Cruise America and paying them...the customer should be the priority.
3,5,David Jones have been most accomodating and helped me to sort out some international issues I have been struggeling with. I can warmly reccomend it.
3,5,We had a terrible time with the coach we rented.  After returning home I went back in to talk to them about my rental.  After hearing our story they refunded us 2 days of our rental and gave us a great deal for our next rental. Thank you for your customer service.  You do not see this alot these days.
3,1,"My family rented one of the Cruise Across America RVs for a bucket list trip for my son who is battling a rare blood disorder which is terminal. We had planned on leaving from PA and traveling out to Wyoming so that he could experience the beauty of nature. During the deliver of the RV, the employees did not show us how to work much of anything. He did not show us hohw to use the hot water or generator. There were also roaches crawling all over the inside of the RV. As I was driving it down Route 80, I had to hold onto the wheel for dear life to keep it from going off the road! In Several states later, we ran into a rainstorm only to find out the wipers needed to be replaced. Once we made it to South Dakota, in the BAD LANDS (middle of nowhere) the generator wouldnt work and more, the a/c unit in the bunk area wouldnt blow anything but hot air and the heating didnt work (it gets cold in the desert)! When we called the assistance number, we were told that there was nothing they could do for us other than have us sit where we were and wait to hear back from them. They never called us!! After several attempts to get help with the junk RV they rented to us for our DREAM vacation, they told us we would have to redirect HUNDEREDS of miles off route to get to a service area. At the service area, we would have to sit and wait (perhaps even over night) while the RV was checked for issues. We were told that we would get a refund for the down time of the RV. We were told we would be reimbbursed for hotel expenses. At the end of the day, not only did they fulfill their promise, but they also charged my card extra after our trip (due to faulty equipment that wasnt ""present"" upon delivery) I dont know who these people think they are! How do you leave people stranded in the desert, ruin a vacation we safed YEARS for and say ""oh well""? Cruise America, you should be ashamed of yourselves!!! 

Kelly D., I am very interested in joining your class action suit against this negligent company that puts families at risk. PLEASE SEND ME DETAILS!!!"
3,1,"We rented a standard size RV from Cruise America in July with the plan of driving myself, my wife, 2 kids and 2 dogs to from Orlando, FL to Austin, Tx for the RTX (Rooster Teeth) convention. 

As I was driving away from the rental lot the check engine light came on. I immediately called the rental office, they apparently checked with the mechanic that serviced the RV and assured me it was just a sensor and wouldn't affect the performance or the trip. I told them I could turn around and exchange it but they said it would be fine. 

We got to Ocala, FL (80~ miles - 1 hour away) when the RVs anti-theft system activated causing the engine cut off while I was driving. Cruise America has a roadside assistance service that handles making all the arrangements for when people have trouble on the road. After going back and forth with them and the office in Kissimmee the only solution they would provide us was to tow the RV to a campsite, where we would have to sleep in the RV so they could tow it to a local mechanic in the morning where we'd all (including my dogs) have to sit in the waiting room while they fixed this issue. This was the only option they gave us. 

We got to the campsite and about an hour after hooking up, all the power in RV shut off, including the AC unit. Even after getting the external generator running it still wasn't able to turn on the AC. Luckily a man at the campsite showed us how to reset the RVs breakers and electrical unit (not the breaker box at the campsite). But after about 15 minutes all the power cut off again. We reset it again and my son pulled out his cellphone charger and that blew the system again. So it was clear that the RVs electrical system was unreliable. In an attempt to see how much electricity the RV was able to handle I turned on the microwave and it started sparking as if there was tinfoil in it (there was nothing in it). Now my family felt the RV was a fire hazard as well! My wife and son were really upset and my daughter started to have an anxiety attack. 

The roadside assistance woman was absolutely no help and was practically insulting. Her only real line of help was to just read a troubleshooting list from their database, none of which did anything to fix the RV. She was completely unsympathetic to our situation and even laughed about it at one point and said, ""Well, hope things get better for ya."" She offered no solution outside of the very minimum that the company would allow her. She ""wasn't able"" to even pay for a cabin that was at the campsite ($45). Her answer was since we were able to get the AC running at times that meant the RV was usable and she couldn't assist in getting us a different location to sleep in. Even after I explained that the AC was unreliable and the the microwave throws sparks. She could only say we will have a tow truck take it to the mechanic in the morning. I tried to talk to a manager, any ""higher-up"" or even just another operator to hopefully find someone with a heart, but she ""wasn't able"" to transfer this issue to another person. 

We ended up leaving the RV at the campsite and taking a shuttle home that night. (an additional $220 I was not reimbursed for)"
3,1,"I was initially happy with Cruise America when I first looked them up and made a reservation (almost two months in advance of when I needed the RV).  This premature assessment quickly degraded as time neared for me to pick up my rental.  I had gone out of my way to ensure everything was ready to go when they had informed me just a mere couple of days before that there would be an additional deposit and I had to fax additional forms.  I had asked multiple times ahead of time if there was ANYTHING else, but was assured there wasn't going to be.  I stepped up and provided what was needed...and hoped that would be the only bump in the road (so-to-speak).

Time comes to pick up the RV...my friend and I are about 20 minutes early and I have all of my documentation in order.  The pickup process at the actual rental facility in San Fernando was a nightmare.  So many mistakes were made.  We were nearly not allowed to pick up the rental because of errors made on the part of those working there.  One of the errors they made was they ran my card for the balance owed but had exited the contract prior to it posting in the computer system.  When they opened the reservation back up (on the computer), there was still an amount due for $800+.  They asked to swipe my card again, but I told them they already charged it.  They insisted and, obviously, it didn't go through.  They told me that I can't pick it up until I pay the balance owed.  I spent hours on the phone with my bank, their  offices and with friends (that were waiting to load up the RV).  After they looked into my assertions (about my card already being charged), they realized that I was correct in that my card was, in fact, charged.  By the time they finally got it corrected (thanks to Lee Kindernay and an IT administrator from the corporate offices), it was almost 3 hours later.  We got to the place to begin loading up the RV and saw that the hitch lock was still on (we needed the hitch to attach the bike rack to).  I called the rental facility in San Fernando and they said ""oops, I forgot...bring it back up and we'll take care of it"".  A few more gallons of gas, additional mileage, and time wasted, we were FINALLY ready to load up the RV.  We had planned to leave by 5:30pm...that turned into 10pm because of this whole disaster.  Driving through the night was not pleasant and required ridiculous amounts of caffeine.

We get to our destination just fine and the RV seems to be just fine as well.  The next day, I go to use the shower and find that it doesn't work.  One of the big reasons why I wanted to camp with an RV is because it has a shower.  I was told when I picked it up that everything was in working order by the rental facility.

Upon return of the RV, the process was no less stressful.  The same people that seemed to lack ANY customer service skills were there putting me through similar headaches as when we picked up the RV.  Out of $1,000 security deposit (ridiculous, huh!?), I got a couple hundred back.  Considering I paid to have the RV professionally cleaned and didn't damage anything, that's pretty bad.

I called Cruise America a couple of times about these issues.  I wrote them some emails.  I even sent a letter.  To date, NOTHING has been resolved.  They didn't even try sending an apology form letter with a partial refund.  I've submitted an official complaint to the Better Business Bureau and have posted numerous bad reviews.  They don't seem to care.  It is nearing the verge of making this a legal matter.  It is absurd how little they care.  Had they just apologized and refunded me a little bit of the $2,500 (roughly) that I spent, then I would have been content in rating them with 3 stars.  It's their lack of care that gets them just 1, which, in fact, is still being generous!"
3,1,"Booked my RV And was told via the website that I could come to the reservation desk anytime between 1 and 4pm. Upon my arrive I sat down and waited. After a a while I asked how long and they said do you have an appointment? I said no, I was never told that I needed to book one. Other people in the waiting room were also very upset. One of the staff said it could be hours and if I had things to do I should go and do them! Completely unacceptable and an absolute joke! Utterly ridiculous and horrific customer service!"
3,1,"This company doesn't keep its word.

Until this morning, Cruise America (also known as CruiseCanada) had a promotion for free one-way rentals from Vancouver to Toronto. The customer service rep in charge of the promotion left me a voicemail message yesterday afternoon: ""The RV is held for you overnight, I'm leaving in 20 minutes but you can pay the $300 reservation fee tomorrow."" Fine.

I called her this morning, credit card in hand. Sorry, the deal is no longer available. You didn't pay, so no RV for you. But you promised to hold it! Yes, but ""hold"" doesn't mean anything.

I asked to speak to her boss. She refused, then insisted that she doesn't have a boss.
I hung up and called back, asking to speak to a manager. The CSR who answered insisted that she didn't know the office manager's name.

Good luck if you rent from this company."
3,5,"Took a three day trip using using one of Cruise America's Motorhomes.  Was my first time renting/driving an RV.   Our vehicle was clean and comfortable.  Everything worked as advertised.    Pick up and drop off were a breeze.  Tina and Karen were absolutely awesome.  We were instructed well on the operation of the RV.  We will definitely be looking forwards to our next road trip.    Don't be intimidated to drive a motorhome, I hadn't before and managed 1000 miles in 3 day with no problems.     5 stars."
3,1,"Beware!  Be really careful using Cruise America.  There is a lot of fine print in their rental contract.  If you get in an accident, even if it is someone else's fault (and even if you can prove it with a Police Report) they will charge your credit card $1000.  Allegedly they will return it eventually but be wary because I have been waiting 8 months and have not received a refund.  I called and emailed them multiple times and it was like pulling teeth to get someone to reply (imagine a black hole / a place where everyone is nameless and unaccountable).  Only after I complained to the BBB and other places did I get a response.  Of course now they say they are ""very responsive"" since they finally responded after tremendous prodding. 

Basically I advise you stay away.  The aggravation of dealing with their service folks is reason enough to shop elsewhere."
3,4,"We just got back from our first RV trip. We rented the large RV through Cruise America in Mesa and had a great experience. The unit was clean and ready to go when promised. There were 2 adults, 3 kids and a dog and we had enough room. We had an issue with the generator, but were compensated for it when we returned our unit. We are looking forward to another RV trip soon and would rent from Cruise America again in a heartbeat."
3,5,"Okay folks, this ain't our first rodeo when dealing with Cruise America RV Sales. We bought a 2010 Majestic 19G from the Carson, CA location back in Feb 2013. Since then, we have put more than 25 thousand miles on the rig. Routine maintenance, a set of tires, and a flush valve in the toilet has been our only expenses (not counting an occasional power wash). We bought the extended warranties on the chassis and the interior, and have never had to use either one. Using truckstop fuel, our mileage has been 11-12 mpg.

Nearly three years later, the story continues...we just traded up to a 2011 27G. After two or three phone calls to Dave Jones at the Mesa, AZ location, we drove from Texas to see and buy a larger rig. We arrived just before noon. Mr. Jones was there to greet us and show us several rigs. A serious test-drive confirmed our choice. We chose the 19G's bigger brother, the 27G.

Lunch and a short negotiation period later, we received a fair trade-in and did the necessary paperwork. A cashiers check and a title swap, the deal was done. It took an hour or so to transfer our ""stuff"" out of the 19G into the 27G...done and out the gate just before dark.

Had to go back the next day for a couple of nit-picky gripes to be fixed ( a broken passenger armrest and a loose side mirror). After about an hour and a 43 gallon fill up, we were soon in rush hour Phoenix traffic on our way to San Diego. A gas top off on Yuma figured that we were getting 10 mpg at 65 mph...not bad considering the larger size rig and the much larger Triton V-12.

This RV will probably our last; however, if we want another one...we will return to Cruise America."
3,2,"This is the corporate office ..they manage all the independent agents who rent the RV's. If you have a problem with the RV, they give you the run around..we got transfered all over the company and were told to email in order to get a response to our leaking RV. Ultimately they told us we had to deal with our local agent who then told us we had to talk with Corporate. 

The company is very friendly and helpful when booking a reservation however if you have any problems with the vehicle, they do not make themselves available to you. 

For those traveling with young children, the Large sized RV does not fit a pack n' play as we were told. Unfortunately the seat belts in the RV's are all lap belts making safety an issue when attaching car seats.

** an update - I received an email on Yelp from an ex-employee of this company who validated all my complaints and said that I should be lucky that I only had a water leak. This person had a gas leak and the company didn't help her and she was an employee -- You have been warned! Do not use this company **"
3,1,"First I would like to say ""It is good to be home where I can use a working toilet, wash my hands and  take a shower and not breath propane fumes!
We were so excited to take this family vacation, it was a very special one for us. Last year my Mom became sick and was hospitalized. They did some tests and found Cancer. stage four, untreatable. While my mom was in the hospital, my Dad became ill. I thought it was stress from mom being sick, since we were at the hospital day and night I took dad to the ER and they did some tests and found Cancer, stage four, untreatable. 
We lost both Mom and Dad within three months of each other. We were DEVASTATED to say the least! May 20, 2013 was the one year anniversary of my mothers passing. My Dad followed her in death on Aug 9th and his one year anniversary is coming up soon. June 10th is my mothers Birthday so my sisters and nieces thought it would be nice to remember them in a special way, so we booked a trip to the beach where Dad proposed to my Mom. 
After Mom had passed and before Dad passed we made a ""bucket list"" for Dad and this was one of the places he wanted to go because it had so many happy memories for him. My sisters and I promised each other we would return once a year, in remembrance of them. This was our first year and we were making good on our promise.
 Our Vacation was a NIGHTMARE! We arrived at the rental pickup location after a 7 hour drive to pick it up. When he showed us our rental my heart just broke! It was filthy and disgusting! Holes and stains in the upholstery, cupboards where broken, it was NOT clean! So what do we do now? We are 7 hours from home and decided to make the best of it, so we took it as planned. 
After paying, they tell us that the gas in NOT full of gas, propane is empty as well as the water tanks!( In their add they claimed it would be all ready to go, full on gas and water and propane and cleaned...this was false!) so we gas up, fill the water and propane and hit the road. Praise God we did not have far to go only 35 miles to the first destination, about five miles to our destination, we hear a noise coming from the front passenger side tire, pull over and look at it and it is BALD. We were all females, not good with mechanics at all so we limp to our destination and parked it for the night. My niece who was following us, told us water was leaking out REALLY bad the whole way.We turned on the fridge...not working, but we could smell the propane. Call travelers assistance asap, They tell us they will call back shortly, never heard from them. The next morning we have to drive to our next beach camping spot 30 miles away so we hit the road because the campground we were in had no available spots for us and we could not stay. We filled the water back up because it had all leaked out on our way there the day before. So we limped to the next place, where we would stay for the rest of our trip. On the way, most of the water leaked out again and the tire was making that sound still, had my sister pull along side us and she said the tire was wobbling really bad, we were lucky it did not come off and cause an accident! Again call travelers assistance and they tell me someone will call back shortly........ 
So we are finally here!! At our destination...the place where our Dad proposed to our Mom, the place my sisters and I promised we would visit each year together in their memory. This spot was for RV camping only, they have no hook-up so you must be fully self contained.
we get there and most of our water leaked out, propane was empty because it had a leak and leaked out the night before as we slept!! 
Took a shower and now the shower flooded, and water was leaking in the vehicle from the shower, and kitchen sink. We had to scoop it out with a bucket. by that night we had a glorified tent, No water, no power, no propane, and now no toilet, because it was full and was supposed to be empty as they claimed and the indicator lights were not working so we had no idea they were full until the sewer leak. With the tire bald and wobbling we could not even move it to dump it. I called Travelers assistance again and they tell us that because it was Sunday we would not hear from anyone until Monday. on Monday they wanted us to take it to a service center or travel a 3hour trip to exchange it in LA very close to Compton we said no way and returned it and ended our vacation early."
3,1,"I am writing this awful review on the Mesa, AZ location because that is the number on their website. Terrible service... A truck they rent does a hit & run on my car & they don't show a single care or sense of urgency to help the victim out. I am thankful a bystander saw the whole thing and got the license plate number.  I had to call a couple times complaining to finally get a call back... ""It could be 2 weeks to get an adjuster out make a claim"" are you kidding me???... A hit & run that involves one of their RVs!! They said they wanted to contact the driver first but kept me waiting at home for hours!!  A simple call back right away saying ""ok, let us reach the driver & get your info"" should have been the protocol.  Now I've called the police & the driver in the RV will have to deal with that. This could have been so much simpler. Cruise America...I am the victim here! If I ever travel and need an RV or one of my friends need one I will go out of my way to make sure they DO NOT use your company!!"
3,1,"Where to even begin. First and foremost let me start by saying the motor home we rented was great. It was very comfortable and served it's purpose well. In regard to customer service however, Cruise America is THE WORST COMPANY TO DEAL WITH, IN THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN CAPITALIST OLIGARCHY! 

If you want to take a chance with the safety and livelihood of your family, then go ahead and gamble with this greedy and disgusting excuse for a rental company. If your trip goes off without a hitch, you will most likely enjoy your experience, and will not have any issues. If you are like us however, and happen to run into a hurricane induced sand storm, on a major coastal highway, which renders the RV engulfed in sand and immobile, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU. 

You will most likely have to call for a tow, in which a customer service rep might be able to dispatch for you, or he might not. In our case, he told us that the closest tow available was over an hour and a half away and that we would be responsible for the cost of the tow and any damages to the vehicle. As the sand was piling up and the South Carolina DPW was doing donuts around us in an excavator (mainly to prevent us from being buried), this option seemed slightly ludicrous. Especially given that my 17 month old baby girl and wife were in the RV and scared out of their minds. We called 911, who was able to dispatch a tow in under a half hour, but to our dismay the tow needed approval from CruiseAmerica. Given that cell reception was spotty at best during the storm, we had to call CruiseAmerica back, to get said confirmation. The confirmation again came with the reminder that we were financially responsible. All of this took time, and added to our tow bill, as the tow truck was already out in the storm, and had returned to its home base. The tow truck driver had to come back out, and tow us out to the tune of 1000 dollars. 

After getting our confirmation and acquiring our tow to safety, we didn't hear from Cruise America again, until 18 hours after the event. YES 18 HOURS LATER THEY CALLED US TO FOLLOW UP! Had we left it up to them, we most likely would have been buried in the storm.

When writing to customer service about this event, we were told that upper management would review the case, and contact us. That was over a month ago. To date we have yet to receive even the most sincerest of apologies from the company. We are good customers, who paid for the minimal amount of damage done to the RV by the storm, and for the tow to safety. We realize that the event was a natural disaster, unpredictable by us or Cruise America. Our dismay with customer service during the wake of the event, has left the most foul taste in our mouths. We will NEVER RENT FROM CRUISE AMERICA AGAIN. 

If you value your families safety on the road, DO NOT ENTRUST THEIR COMMUTE IN A CRUISE AMERICA VEHICLE!"
3,1,"I have rented from Cruise America two times now over the past two years.    Each time we rented the 30' camper.  The first experience was great.  The first rental was newer, clean and in great condition.  The second was not in the best of condition.  It had small things like the glass door on the shower had been removed and replaced with a cheep plastic curtain.  The molding above the driver seat was falling off.  All small things and nothing major however for the price paid it should have been maintained better.  

NOW TO THE REAL PROBLEM.  We went to Va Beach for the first two days then were heading to Williamsburg, Va.  When we got to the Elizabeth River Tunnel there are no toll booths.  It's either EzPass (Which we could not use because our EzPass is registered to a car not a camper) or toll by plate.  We even pulled off just before the tunnel so they could check to make sure our propane was off.  We asked the attendant what we should do since there are no lanes that accept cash and we were in a rental.  She said there is nothing we could do but go through it and pay the toll when it arrives.  She didnt even know how much the toll was.  So when we returned the unit we mentioned it.  The dealer said they will just send us the invoice when it arrived.  No problem.  Well today I got the invoice.  The Elizabeth River Tunnels charged us only $4.95 however Cruise America Inc charged us a $10.00 processing fee!  I called John at Cruise America at 11 West Hampton Ave, Mesa AZ 85210 (480) 464-7305 and explained the situation.  He explained that it takes them time when they get the invoice to look up the license plate for each of the violations and it also cost them .49 Cents to mail me the notice. REALLY......... I paid $1,862.92 for six nights and he's worried about .49 Cents in postage for a return customer.  I could see if I had several unpaid tolls but for only one time and a repeat customer they cant waive a $10.00 fee!  They just lost a customer that would have been doing yearly rentals in the future if this had not happened."

For 2 people and 2 dogs it worked out perfect.

Would do again."
3,1,"I am now filing suit against this horrible company for so many reasons listed in my below reveiw. Having a Truck with Dangerouse Alignment Issues, Worn Wipers, Broken Fridge, Generator Broke after 2 Days, No Heat, No Electricity, only 1 working charge port off truck battery, and ants infested in truck! In the contract and during this trip I was told I would be reimbursed for ""down time and expenses, inclduing hotels etc"". They breached this contract, they never gave credit to me for this, and to make matters worse they had the nerve to charge me for 9 days (In my opinion the entire 9 days was ""down time""), due to all of the issues. If they were to follow their own contract and promises from Road Side Assistance (their only customer service, when your on the road!). I informed them on DAY 5 after being stranded all day trouble shooting with them in a parking lot in Utah with No A/C Sweating to death, that I was done and going to Denver.  I told them I would get the truck to them ASAP, however, due to my health condition that is STRESS INDUCED I was not going to do any driving and my friend would be. So it took us 3 days to get it to them from Utah because we stayed in a hotels, stuck in traffic, stuck in a tornado storm, and had to find a Hotel in Colorado to spend hours unloading the truck (You can read this whole story in my review).  You would think if they gave a crap about thier reputation and customers, they would honor their ""down time reiumbursment"", and to top it off they charged GAS, and they charged me to clean the truck! Are you kidding me?????  I was stuck in HELL with this vehicle and told Road Side Assistance that I would NOT be wasting one more moment for cleaning vehicle, gas, and when I got to Denver I got there, and was not going to rush for them! 

The truck was DANGEROUS!  This COMPANY IS HORRIBLE, I AM NOW IN THE PROCESS OF GATHERING REPRESENTATIVES TO JOIN MY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THIS COMPANY. IF YOUR ARE INTERESTED IN JOINING, PLEASE MESSAGE ME.  THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO KNOW THEY ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLES LIVES AND THE SAFETY OF THEM, AND THEIR VALUED VACTION TIME THAT IS TREASURED. THEY ARE RUINING SO MANY PEOPLES PRECIOUS VACATIONS!"
3,1,"WORST RV RENTAL EVER

If I could give the ZERO or Negative Stars I would 

sent us out with NO FREON, which I had to install just to survive 

Engine Cowling leaking HOT AIR AND ENGINE FUMES, and Mike tells me "" it's normal "" for this heat""
I drove 1800 miles and burned my legs and coughed the entire time 

Blowout in Death Valley. Towing company writes receipt saying there is a nicked valves stem leading to slow leak which caused tires to mushroom and blow 

THEY POORLY SERVICE Nor RETIRE POOR mechanical VEHICLES 

We returned at closing and requested one more day rental to clean out RV and they refused just to whack us a $500 cleaning fee. I'd never recommend this establishment to ANYONE.  

POOR POOR SERVICE AND ATTITUDE.  

MONEY DRIVEN AT ANY EXPENSE.  

They also locked us in the gate, and coerced us into a one sided resolution just so we could move on after driving 900 miles and a blowout

Told us we couldn't keep it an extra day to do proper clean out because it was "" rented ( the day after Labor Day with 30 RVs on the lot????)   They lied , coerced and denied everything.  

Poorest customer
service ever, actually non existent 



I have written the home office a complete complaint letter to Cruise America office with my objections and am awaiting a satisfactory response 


STAY AWAY

AMENDED UPDATE 


Instead of working this out to negotiate a fair settlement , and upgrade their review to 5 star for being responsive, they responded with threats . 

I gave them the opportunity to revisit their customer service practices and discuss the issues, and earn many customers instead of. Have them away
Here was Mesa Cruise America's response :


Mike's response was 

""Brad,

I just read on my phone your yelp review about firm.  Obviously we differ substantially in our views on this  matter.  

The allegations you stated are not only untrue, they paint our firm in a very negative which has result in financial damage to our firm.  The damage you caused to our equipment while at Burning Man, then disparage our firm, is simply unacceptable.

I have no choice but to vigorously pursue all legal options against you and any authorized drivers

Michael""

*************

Instead of working to find an equitable solution with a customer to upgrade the review to 5 star and address serious issues , they would rather spend the same money on lawyers and collections instead of acknowledging an unhappy customer's legitimate complaints and their failures 

Need I say more ?  You decide as a customer if u want to patronize this establishment . I know I won't ever use Mesa Cruise America again 

Customer service appears to not be in their vocabulary
Read the rest of the reviews and you'll see a pattern of serious disconnect in their service and customer service"
3,5,"I purchased the Majestic 28A from Cruise America in Mesa over a year ago. There were two very minor problems initially, which they repaired while I waited. Since then, it has been flawless and a pure joy. I live it it full time. I have driven it and lived in it without a complaint. It is the care free lifestyle I had imagined."
3,1,"This company does not service their equipment very well. We had a hose break on the freeway on the way home, and after 9 hours, when we went to turn in the RV, the dealer was closed. I told them what happened, and he gave me a small refund, then charged me all these extra fee's. I then wrote a letter in writing to customer service, and still no response after almost 30 days.

I would not rent from them if I was you."
3,1,"Will never buy anything from Findley ever again. We bought a brand new travel trailer from findley and have had nothing but problems from day one. We realized a large list of issues with our trailer. Findley lies and says the manufacturer has not gotten back to them. When I called the manufacturer, they respond to claims in 24 hours. So findley doesn't report the claims. In addition, when they finally do submit the claim , and  call is to do the work, the work that they do is ridiculous. The people are incompetent and have actually ruined our camper by cutting our roof and then not sealing it , when they were replacing a panel due to a manufacturer defect. We now will not longer let findley work on our camper. Possibly contacting an attorney at this point. We have had our camper for 11 months . It's gone from bad to worse."
3,1,"After getting the unit home and living in it a week this is what i have discovered. The convection oven doesnt work, there was a random plug in the water heater that took us a day to figure out was even there and to remove it, the air conditioner over the bedroom has lost a bearing or something of that sorts and the back tank lever thingy that closes it worked great once, but is now jammed. NEVER BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE....and if you do, spring the extra four grand and get the comprehensive warranty they offer"
3,5,"About a month ago, I discovered that I had some problems with our 2013 Winnebago Tour that needed to be fixed. We were vacationing around Los Angeles at the time and after checking out three dealers in the area I became discouraged by the comments written about their service departments. Realizing that I wasn't taking my RV to any of them I started looking elsewhere.

Our plan was to travel back through Las Vegas so I found online that Findlay RV had rewards for service so I called to see if an appointment with them was possible. Ray Arbesu answered the phone and he was able to set up an early appointment for us but explained that until he inspected the coach he couldn't promise that everything could be fixed when we brought it in.

We arrived on a Monday morning at 8:00 am for our appointment and after going over our list with Ray, he explained what could be fixed that day and those repairs that parts would have to be ordered for. Our coach was immediately taken to a service bay and those items that could be repaired were done promptly and correctly. My wife and I stayed in the service department while work was being done and Ray kept us informed as to when the repairs would be completed. He also explained what parts had to be ordered and when they might arrive so that the remaining issues would be resolved.

We left Vegas for a week while the parts were being shipped to the dealership and Ray kept us informed on when to return. When we did, the remaining repairs were again completed correctly.

We can't thank Ray enough for the time he spent going over the needed repairs and getting them fixed so we could continue traveling to our home on the east coast. We'd also like to thank the technician Zakk who worked hard on repairing it.

I highly recommend Findlay RV for service and especially Ray who took care of us. I've worked in the automotive industry for over thirty-seven years and know good dealerships when I see them and Findlay RV is tops in my book!

3,5,"After reading the previous comments, my husband and I paid a visit to Findlay without any expectations that we would buy anything. We asked for Kathy based on other comments and found her to be just awesome! She took us to see every model we thought we liked in the heat. We were all sweating and uncomfortable but Kathy put up with us all afternoon. We absolutely loved her and valued her knowledgeability and kindness. We met other employees throughout the afternoon and every one of them were friendly, helpful and pleasant. After a few days of driving Kathy crazy, we decided to purchase a Winnebago Class A and we are so thrilled with the choice. Kathy stayed available during the delivery and financing process, even bringing me snacks when I was starving. Rod did our walk through and was very detail oriented and thoroughly went over everything with us. The finance director, Mike was extremely patient and kind, even when I had a meltdown when I realized that we had been hornswoggled in our previous purchase. Kathy listened to me rant and then we were able to close the deal. We feel confident that these people will be available to us as we embark on our new adventure. We also met and spoke with the parts manager Mike about adding anti sway bars and he was also very helpful and will be following up on our requests. If you are in the market for an RV, I strongly suggest you visit Findlay. They really are the best. Happy Trails!"
3,1,Love our used trailer. Buyer beware check the age of the tires or you may regret it. 3 out of 4 lost their tread first long trip. 8 years old. Looked good but weren't.
3,1,"Findlay Rv center is the worst place I have ever deal with back in June 3,2013 my air conditioner went out while traveling to vegas so I went to Findlay to get one ,they had one in stock but could not install it because they were busy. So we installed it our self.
We returned to Vegas in aug 14,2013 and the air conditioner burns up mind you it's under warranty so I call Findlay they don't have one in stock this is on the 15th they will order one from dominaic they will call me when it comes in should be two days. It's 112 degrees out and we r living in the Rv. So on Monday goes by we don't hear on the21st I call and they say it's not warranty because we put it on. So I call dometic they say that not true. Dometic calls them to tell them they have to cover it so they tell us we need a disonise check to see what wrong at our cost. So I call dometic they said that we don't need to do that mind you it's the 22 now  so dometic said don't deal with them. So I call Camping world well guess what they are not any better could not get us in until Sept 7 th. so we call Sarah Rv in vegas they were were able to get us in on the 16 th a fri and had one in stock   In two hours it was on and we back on the road THANK YOU  Sahara.  They are very nice people and did a great job.   As for Findlay they SUCK"
3,5,"We stopped in to see about selling our RV on consignment. We had tried another RV dealer in this area and RV Trader without much luck. We met Kathy Dawson as soon as we entered the showroom. John, the manager, made us an offer and it was a fair offer. Kathy was confident it would sell. After 5 days, they SOLD it! She was professional and knowledgeable. We have a new friend"
3,1,"I wish I could say something positive about this place, but my experience with this place has been horrible thus far. 
My husband and I were looking for a new camper, we found one we liked and started the financing process. We were getting a great deal and this particular fifth wheel would fit our life style well. A week later we went through our own bank to finance and picked a date to pick up our new (used) fifth wheel. The Wed. before we were to pick it up we called to see if we could pick it up a day earlier and were promptly told no, that there were no open appointments that day.......and that the main awning motor was missing so they took it upon themselves to remove the awning without even a phone call to us. After a day and a half of phone tag and much negotiation we agreed to pay half of the cost of a new motor and the labor to instal, i mean did i really need that $500?
The day of the trade in we showed up at our appointment time, signed a bunch of papers and were taken to our new home on wheels, there was a technician there to do a walk through with us, and we knew more about the unit then he did, awesome. I asked him how long the unit had been on the lot, he told me 3 years, the salesman told me 8 months. When it was time to transfer our stuff from our old camper to the new one, no one was there to reposition the new trailor so we had to move boxes one by one across a parking lot, which at first glance doesnt sound so bad, but in hour 2 it suck.  Before we left the sales manager approached me and told me that they had ""miss placed"" the keys to the unit and for me to call a locksmith have the locks rekeyed, to send them the reciept and they will reemberse me, we will see if that really happens. 
We get the rv home, and the water heater isnt working, lights have shorted out, the cieling fan wont turn on and there are cob webs....wth. we were told everything was checked and worked, and that the unit was detailed. 
Needless to say when we purchase our next rv it will not be from these people."
3,3,"Just recently bought a toy hauler from Finday RV and was having a great experience till having to deal with the short Mexican women behind the parts counter. She was very unfriendly unwelcoming to a point we almost walked out before our deal was finalized. Our salesman John was awesome, Rod and the mechanic all made the experience great. The female behind the parts counter should not be in any type of customer service what so ever."
3,3,"UPDATE: 6 months after dealing with Findlay RV I received a call from the GM. The manager was very apologetic for my experiences and said he would address the issues. He also said he would refund my out of pocket expenses that insurance didn't cover with me bringing up any money. I was very impressed by the way the manager addressed the situation. I hope the service department customer service and their work gets a big improvement from management before they lose more customers.

HERE IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:

SERIOUSLY: STAY AWAY!

If you're in a hurry, here's my review in a nutshell: absolutely deplorable service, shady and irresponsible business tactics, and mechanics who cut every corner they can! I seriously wish I could leave a review with a negative amount of stars.

If you're STILL considering leaving your RV with these people, please continue reading.

We live and travel the U.S. in our travel trailer. We had a pipe spring a leak under our shower and needed to get our trailer somewhere fast while in Vegas. We had a mobile RV repairman fix the broken pipe but we needed to get the rest of the coach checked out for damage. The only place with any availability(wonder why) was Findlay, so we booked it. BIG MISTAKE.

When we brought it in on a Friday, we left it there over the weekend because they didn't have time to look at it that day. On Monday, they told us we needed to get new insulation under the ENTIRE coach. The replacement for ALL insulation was about 1k, they told us. Our rig is a 2014 (new from the factory) so we immediately filed an insurance claim. It took the insurance people all week to agree to pay for the new insulation, so it sat at Findlay all week. While we were sorting all of this out we had to deal with the crabby jerk who sits behind the desk and answers the phone. She(Brandy) was beyond rude every time we spoke to her, and could have cared less about our situation.

On Friday, a week after we dropped it off, they said they had the go-ahead from the insurance to begin working on it. Problem was, we were scheduled to go up to Utah and spend several weeks there for the Christmas holiday the next day. We would be gone for two weeks, so we assumed they could fix it on the lot (which they estimated would only a couple days) and then keep it there until we drove back. NOPE. They said once they finished it, we would have to pay $50/DAY for them to hold it there.  So, we had to pick up our rig with sopping wet insulation and drive it to a storage lot in vegas and store it without it getting fixed. Wow.

When we got back to Vegas on January 1, we brought our back in to Findlay to get the insulation fixed. We had them drop the insulation and call us when it was was down so that we could examine it for mold -- we didn't trust there word on it at all. When we got there, we saw that only the very front of the insulation was pulled out(less than 25% total). When we asked about this, they told us ""that was the only area with water damage."" This was so shady -- they had quoted us and the insurance company about $1k to remove and replace ALL of the insulation, not just part of it. We approached the manager about it and she told us that was all they were willing to do.

They told us it would be done the next day, and it took them four more days to finally complete it. When we finally picked it up, the underbelly looked like absolute Sh*t. There were pieces of insulation sticking out everywhere. Dealer also refused to fix any of the horrible work, I guess horrible service work must be their standard of service!

When we arrived in Salt Lake City, I opened up the pass through boxes to put some storage inside and discovered that the mechanics had drilled the screws for the insulation up into the storage boxes! There were about 10 exposed screws sticking straight up like land mines. I was extremely upset about the way that we were treated at Findlay but this just added to the horrible experience.

Moral of the story? If you are looking for an absolutely certain way to ruin your RV and your day/week/month, go to Findlay!! If not, please for the love of all that is holy, go elsewhere!!!!

***Update*** Our insurance company tried for 2 weeks to contact Findlay in regards to the screws sticking up throughout the floor in the pass-through box, however it took the insurance guy calling for repeatedly for 2 weeks to get a return call.  The dealer has also refused to fix the damaged flooring unless the trailer is brought back directly to Findlay (We are 7 hours away in SLC)

STAY AWAY!"
3,5,Findlay RV has gone through many changes and updates to be more Customer Service oriented and it's working. Keep up the great work.
3,1,"I give this shady, unprofessional, worthless RV dealership a ZERO!!! Do NOT buy your RV from them. You are better off purchasing a RV from an out-of-state dealership such as Utah or Arizona. 
We bought an $84K fifth-wheel from this place and we had a horrible experience starting from the receptionist all the way to the general manager. The sales staff is a joke. They are lazy, unprofessional, smokers and drunks. They think they are too good (arrogant). The management is a bunch of shady, incompetent liars. They shift the blame onto their subordinates, or they make you sound as if you are the one who is wrong or mistaken.
The service department is just as bad. They tell you that they have fixed/repaired the parts, but when you get it home, nothing works properly. They also keep your trailer for weeks at a time, so if you plan on using it, good luck getting it back on time for your next trip. 
Trust me, they rig everything. 
DO NOT buy from this dealership. Save yourself the time, money and headache by purchasing from out of state."
3,5,"My husband and I were in Beatty, Nevada when the transfer switch shorted out on our Winnebago RV. We were on our way to Sedona, Arizona so we called many repair places between Beatty and Sedona. Everyone told us it would be at least 4 days to get the part and do the repair. Findlay was able to help us much faster. Brian in the parts department was able to get the new transfer switch overnighted and Brandi in the service department squeezed us in the day the part arrived. Everyone we dealt with was friendly  and helpful. I would definitely use Findlay again if my RV needed repair in the Las Vegas area."
3,5,Great experience!  We came from another state to see their inventory. We got a great price on exactly what we wanted. Helpful and knowledgeable staff made us feel very comfortable.  Highly recommend!
3,5,"We are absolutely thrilled with our new RV and we are so very thankful for Kevin's help and patience. Kevin was so knowledgeable and informative, and he went above and beyond to ensure we got the very best price.My husband is a Vietnam vet, a combat medic and Kevin is also a vet, so he related to special needs we required. Kevin is the absolute best and we thank him and manager John for all their efforts."
3,1,"Ray is rude and not interested in working with repeat customers.....Unless you are ready to buy right then and there. 

On Saturday, May 28th, 2018 we went to Findlay to buy our SECOND RV from THEM and we told the salesman RAY, that we needed to see some Class A's and that we bought the one we drove up in from Findlay about 2 years ago.  After showing us a few units we explained to Ray that we also wanted to see some 5th wheel units to compare.  He quickly asked us if we own a truck, we said ""not yet"", and he then said that ""you guys are from out of town and I will never see you again"" and he turned his back on us and walked away.  We stopped him and even asked for a card and info on the model we were looking at, he handed us a card and just walked away.  

To make matters even worse, the other salesman then walked up to us and told us we had to move our Class A motor home right now, not giving us any direction were to park (we still had the Findlay license plate frames on our rig). 

Ray acted just like the high pressure and aggressive stereotypical used car salesman trying to make a sale at the end of the month.  

We were somewhat shocked, so we did as told and climbed up in our $70K rig we bought from THEM, and drove away.  We will NEVER return to this dealership after being kicked to the curb because we could not buy a rig on the spot."
3,5,"We pulled the trigger and bought the RV! Our sales guy, Kevin Chalker was always responsive and never strayed from every question we had.  While the overall process could have been smoother, we are happy with our two day old purchase so far.  If you are looking, stop by and ask for Kevin.  He will be there to greet you with a smile and a story for sure!"
3,5,"Today is the big day!! Here at FindlayRV to take delivery of my first travel trailer. My salesman Kevin Chalker helped me last week at the Las Vegas motor speedway sales event. He was very knowledgeable about the trailer and also got the vendor representative to answer other questions. 
Kevin Chalker also made sure my truck was capable of towing my trailer and suggested a few improvements to it for safety! By far the best service I have ever had in a major purchase!!
If your interested in getting an RV, fifth wheel or travel trailer, go see Kevin Chalker at FindlayRV off Boulder Highway!!"
3,5,"We brought our 2017 Winnebago Vista in for some warranty work.  A few of the issues were quite vexing.  I can give my unqualified endorsement to their service department and especially the service writer, Tyler Webb.  They clearly took the time to address our concerns and we're well pleased with the thoughtful manner in which the repairs were done."
3,4,"Preface: I'm not a 'customer is always right' woman. I'm a 'fix it right the first time' woman. The service guy failed, but the manager succeeded above my expectations. I would go back, but only because of the manager, Kurt.

My 2007 A-Class was stalling in traffic and had no power up hills or taking off. I won't go into detail, but I do know engines and I know when I'm being patronized. Therefore, if you go here avoid Brent in service and go strait to Kurt. Brent was smug, overbearing and completely dismissed my suggestions. What Brent had fixed had no impact on the problem. When I told the manager (Kurt) about my horrible experience with the service guy (Brent) he did everything he could to make it right. Turns out what I suggested initially was an issue, along with other items that Kurt found. So he fixed my rig and put me back on the street safely AND was nice enough to refund the labor for the 'fix' that didn't need fixed. GREAT customer service if you go to the right person. :-D"
5,5,"We bought our travel trailer from Vans. They are a wonderful Christian family. They all work there Dad Mom sons wife it's great.  They made sure we were well informed about our new home away from home.  
A week after we also received a Thank You card from them with a cute travel trailer on the cover, they had all signed it. AWESOMEEEE!!!!!! 
We call them to ask a question and they remember our names and our trailer. 

We went to several other places looking at travel trailers, we did our research. Most places were too busy to have patience with our questions, and the prices were way too high.  Vans not only answered ALL our questions.   Price was perfect. They threw in some extras and we still came out ahead. 
God is always good and leads us in the right direction if we let him."
4.5,5,"This review is long overdue! I thought I had already written it, but apparently in the craziness of finals I forgot. Anyways, onto my review...

After driving back from California a couple months ago, my check engine light came on and my car was shaking like crazy. Upon referral from a friend, and after reading all the Yelp reviews, I decided to bring my car (Honda CRV) into Valley Automotive. Boy was I glad I did! I got an initial estimate from KC and his staff, but after doing some work it ended up that there was more wrong with my car than was initially thought. However, rather than me having to pay for the additional fixes, KC offered to foot the bill! I was shocked, but forever grateful! The thing that sets Valley Automotive apart from most other auto shops is they care about their customers and want to do right by them. As a graduate student with little money, I appreciate the honest business and work that KC and his staff do at Valley Automotive. I happily referred a friend to them so she could get a second opinion after taking her car to another shop. Valley Automotive saved her money and she was equally as impressed with the service she received!

Apparently my car doesn't like the Vegas heat (who does like 115 degree weather?!) and I noticed that it is leaking coolant. I will gladly be taking my car back to Valley Automotive and doing business with KC and his team again!"

After looking online I stopped into Valley Automotive and KC the Owner
understood my situation and helped me out by recommending what needed to be
done now and explaining that the other problems could be dealt with at a
later time. 

I was under the assumption that the minor problems needed to get fixed asap
but he said that was not necessary and prioritized what work needed to be
done and what could wait so that I could fit it into my budget. While I was
there I asked the other customers that were present what they thought of
Valley Automotive and they all said that they loved it and that Valley
Automotive did all their auto repair and body work. 

What really surprised me was that it wasn't about the money, but for them
driver safety was paramount, for the customer to be treated with respect and
that the customer not to return back for the same problem!

The check engine light was because of the transmission but they solved this by replacing my transmission fluid which was black. I highly recommend these guys they are honest and do what it takes to help."
4.5,5,"KC, Steve, and Sam. What can I say except THANK YOU!!! You made a horrible experience into a wonderful memory. Everyone there went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable!! When they say customer service, they mean it!!!"
4.5,5,Great mechanic. Honest and dependable and would definately recommended their services.
4.5,5,"Cane through with some brake issues on the road. Upon arrival, I was greeted in a friendly manner by a man named KC. Was expecting an estimate for hundreds of dollars after the inspection, but KC called me during my lunch break and was as honest with me as possible. He told me I was under warranty and didn't drown me with estimates I wasn't looking forward to paying. I really appreciate the honesty this company offers me, and I will definitely be coming back for an oil change!"
4.5,5,"This is the most honest automotive business that I've ever used. They have fair prices, friendly service, and great warranties."
4.5,5,"This review is a long time coming.  We have had our 2004 VW Beetle and 2006 Ford Taurus serviced here several times since June 2015.  The Taurus just had normal maintenance and a brake job.  The Beetle is another story, hubby and daughter bought it used and it was an emotional purchase and it was the reason we found Valley Automotive on Yelp.  Casey and his team are very thorough and go over all the options with you.  Example, he will tell you what you need to get you mobile again, what is recommended next and what is suggested for future maintenance and will go over the costs in detail.  He works hard at finding the best parts while trying to stay within your budget, yet doing the job right.  Is this the speediest shop in the Valley? No, it is not a chain ""mega-shop"" but because of that you do get individualized service.  Is it the cheapest shop in the Valley? No, but it is not the most expensive either and they do use quality parts with excellent warranties. Remember, you get what you pay for.  I highly recommend that you check out Valley Automotive for your routine maintenance and establish a relationship before you have to find a mechanic for an emergency."
4.5,5,After talking with Mike the manager on the phone and looking at reviews online my husband decided to take his classic car in for a/c repair. This shop is top notch.  Mike was very friendly. He explained everything and didn't try to sell a bunch of stuff we didn't need.  They got the car right in with no appointment. That's hard to find these days. Valley Automotive has a customer for life. Thank you for the pleasant experience.
4.5,5,"I couldn't be more happier finding this repair shop. I have a BMW and it can be costly for any slight repairs. Went in for it a routine oil change.The owner is absolutely honest and truly cares about his customers. He went over the repairs my car would need in the future in detail even came out and said to me that there was no need to rotate my tires, they were perfectly fine. Was honest about my Air filter not needing to be changed until my next Oil change.

 Being a woman and really not knowing to much about cars. he did not take advantage of me even gave me a break inspection on my vehicle, went over in detail how worn my brakes pads were in the front and in the back, and told me my brakes were perfectly fine.. :) It's truly hard to fine honest repair shops in the city. I know because I've been to a few in my day. :(

Initially I read several reviews on yelp, and this is the reason why I came here and now I am writing my own review. I could not agree more with what I read before coming here!!! Five Stars  :) 
I will definitely Bring my business back to 
""Valley Automotive"" for any future repairs. It's a peace of mind knowing I have a place I can trust if I need any repairs!! :) this is a blessing for me to find this place considering my extended warranty expired from BMW.. I feel confident that my car is in good hands here.. :) so if you're looking for a repair shop this would be the place!!!"
4.5,5,"I've had both of my vehicles in for service on a couple occasions and I've always been 100% satisfied.  I recently had my front brakes done and they used quality parts with a full warranty for little more than it would cost at a cut-rate shop with no warranty.  Super satisfied!

My other vehicle needed troubleshooting for a check engine light and not only did they correct the issue--they went above and beyond by completing a drive cycle and smog testing it for me.  This was a huge help for me due to my work schedule.  

KC is an honest and ethical shop owner, and I would never go anywhere else.  Highly recommended!"
4.5,5,Found valley automotive by looking up reviews. I couldn't of asked for a better experience. Such an honest group of guys. I was rear ended and they helped me from start to finish. They worked with the insurance company so I didn't have to. Just picked up my car and it looks perfect! Thank you so much. I wish I could give you 6 stars!
4.5,5,"I highly recommend Valley Automotive.  They are honest, efficient and courteous."
4.5,5,"KC and his team are awesome.  We have been going to his shop exclusively since moving to NV and have never been disappointed be their service, integrity or results."
4.5,5,"After calling around to find a place that would fix my glove box latch for me cheaper than Honda I found this place and what a wonderful place it is!!!
I spoke with Mike and explained my situation and he told me to just bring car over after work to see if it was just an easy fix. After a good 25 min of trying to figure it out, he found the part and we scheduled for repair. 
The entire thing only took about 45 min MAYBE! and the price was HALF of what Honda wanted to charge me!!!! 
Mike was beyond friendly and helpful!  I have already told some of my coworkers if they ever need something to try this place out!!! 
Thank you thank you thank you!!!!"
4.5,5,"Valley Automotive has been my go-to auto shop since I moved to Vegas over 4 years ago. My vehicle has a little age on it and they are consistently quick, attentive, knowledgeable, and able to diagnose the issue, quickly have a solution for it, and be fixing the problem all while keeping a great customer friendly experience. KC has always been incredibly honest with his explanations and break down of the issue with your vehicle. Their prices have always been great, and they'll let you know exactly what is happening and what your options are before they get to work. I can't recommend this auto shop more."
4.5,1,"My motive in writing this review is to help possible future customers of this business avoid the financial headache that my fiancé and I went through as a result of valley automotive's incompetence and poor business practices. Over the past couple of years we gave this shop $1000's worth of business between 3 different vehicles. I noticed how their shop was progressively empty especially in 2015. Unfortunately with a decline in business they've resorted to desperate, questionable and fraudulent practices. The long and short is that they caused significant damage to my fiance's 1997 BMW by leaving it in the hands of a non certified tech. Charged us to repair the engine. Guaranteed their parts and labor for 12 months. Returned the car with a check engine light and severely rough idle. Accused us of wanting free work and insisted that we pay additional money to diagnose a problem that was due to their poor workmanship. They actually accused us of harassment for requesting that they honor their warranty. The issue never came to resolution. In addition to this, my fiancé dropped off the vehicle and the owner of valley automotive gave her a ride to work. While in the car alone with her the owner KC aka Kalvin Cox thought that it was appropriate to begin disclosing his issues with anger and sex addiction. This made her extremely uncomfortable understandably being alone in a car with the owner of this business acting in such an unprofessional manner. All governing agencies are currently being made aware of the issues that we had with this business. My hope is that no one else be subject to such an experience. You've been made aware!"
4.5,5,I just took my truck to these guys cause my check engine light was on and I couldn't pass a smog check without it.when I first got inside I was recently greeted by the owner of the shop with great hospitality felt he was a really cool guy they look at my truck and found that the fuel pump wasn't put on properly from the other place I took my truck to for a new fuel pump well they fixed that and did a diagnostic check on the truck to make sure nothing else was wrong for free I tried to pay for the diagnostic but they said no charge I will be returns to these guys for any of my car repairs I recommend these guys for any of our car care needs oh May I add they have Netflix in the waiting room normally mechanic shops have dr.phil or some crap talk show on but these guys got a 5 star waiting room
4.5,1,"Oh my gosh what a horrific experience. I took my car there because my transmission was slipping, the next day I called and asked to see when it would probably be done, he said come down after 1230. Well I didn't make it down there till 3 o'clock. I walked in and he proceeded to lecture me on how to drive my car. I honestly think that's when they started working on my car. So an hour later around 4 o'clock he finally ,took me out to the garage where my car was, and it look like he was just finishing up. He told me that he was just topping off my transmission fluid making sure it was full.   There a transmission fluid all over the floor. I wasn't even a block down the street and learned that my car wasn't even engaging in gears,,, I heard grinding and it was slipping even  worse than when I brought it there. When I got home I noticed there were scratches on my car that weren't there before there was transmission fluid all over my floor mats in the front and transmission fluid dripping down the front of my car by the wheels both sides of the hood, what a freaking mess, hopefully all that went wrong was he didn't put enough fluid in and there was no damage. But it sounded horrible coming home. I honestly think no one has the mechanics license in that place. No one knew what they were doing. I would not recommend this place at all it was a horrific experience."
4.5,5,"Wonderful service! I had an issue with my VW (which they will forever give a hard time over), and they really took the time to make sure my car would leave their shop in the best condition possible. I am grateful that they were willing to work around my schedule and always communicated with me regarding the status of repair. 

I highly recommend Valley Automotive for their wonderful service and reasonable pricing!"
4.5,1,I wouldn't give it one star but I had no choice. I didn't personally take my vehicle there but I was there during the process with my family. So she took her van in on I believe was October 1st my dates maybe a little off a few days later the van was ready for pickup so I went with my friend to pick up the van. We got there and the so called mechanic was asleep in the vehicle we finally woke him up he was like it sounds good I think he may still have been asleep because the vehicle wasn't on it was in he said oh that's your car not the van.  I test drove the van exact same problem when the van was given to him not sure if any work had been done so frustrating and disappointing mind you my friend lives in California needed to get back she had her boyfriend and three kids missing work and school oh he took 200.00 off lol what a joke. Finally he did rent them a vehicle which he should have done in the first place or given them their money back so they could have went to someone who could have helped them. Let's fast forward to about 2 weeks later went with my cousin to pick up the vehicle once again I drove it back loud clunking noise took it back to him found a tool left inside of under the hood some loose screws this guy is a joke and his humor is disgusting he said I won a prize he said I can take his son I said no thank you I have four kids of my own he said do you know how to fix that problem you put rocks in his shoes and he will go limp not the type of conversation I care to have with someone I don't know gross. So end of story the van made it back to California and it had to be repaired out there due to faulty and crappy work this shop did do not take your car there.
4.5,5,"I recently traveled to Henderson from Los Angeles for a business trip. Upon my arrival my check engine light came on... so I knew I was in for a long few days. The following day after doing some research and reading some reviews on yelp I came across Valley Automotive. Before making my way to my clients home, my team and I picked up a Uhaul (which we needed for my client anyways) and dropped off my car. it was instantly in great hands with Casey and his team. After checking out my car Casey informed me that it was a good ole transmission problem. He communicated with me throughout the process and was VERY understanding and sincere about my situation. Since my car was still under warranty he contacted the Dodge dealerships to try and make arrangements for me to get it repaired prior to my return back to Los Angeles. He took care of everything. :) AMAZING. Once we realized that it was best to just tow my car back to Los Angeles, he let me store it at his repair shop until I was able to pick it up and haul it back on an auto transport with the uhaul. And if that wasn't enough when I arrived to pick it up his team helped me load it on the auto transport! 

I have never BEEN MORE GRATEFUL for the kindness, flexibility and amazing communication of Casey and his team. Everyone is always looking for an honest mechanic. A place that you can take your car and trust that you aren't getting ripped off... just b/c you are girl or might not know everything about cars. I found this mechanic in Casey and his team. I wish I lived in Henderson b/c he would have my  business for life. Amazing job! Thank you thank you thank you! When I got back to LA and had to deal with my dealership here... I felt prepared. 

You have my referral for life!"
4.5,5,Took my baby Hyundai Veloster turbo in to get an oil change. Mike was amazing. He checked everything and even showed me my air filter which was gross by the way. Mike was thorough and checked ever little thing. When I got my car back it ran like I just got it. They are super nice there. Thank you to KC and Mike for being super amazing.
4.5,5,"Best customer service I've seen in an auto shop. KC, the owner, speaks with each customer individually and will go back with you and the mechanic in the garage to look at what's going on with your car. I ended up leaving our Odyssey overnight so they could fix the AC first thing the next morning, and KC offered to drive me home so my wife didn't have to come get me with all the kids! Very friendly, down to earth group of people here, and they stand by their work. One week after they fixed our AC, a plastic panel came loose near the ac compressor. After looking at it with Robert, the mechanic who helped us, we realized the car had some previous internal body damage from the prior owner (we bought it used) which likely played part in the panel coming off, but because it was involved in the area of the ac repair they still offered to order the part and replaced it free of charge!"
4.5,5,"In December of '15 my 2001 Silverado died in the middle of driving it. I had it towed there based on their reviews and I could not have been happier. I have been having problems with it holding coolant and various other issues. The crew at Valley dived right in to figure out what was wrong. It didn't take long for them to figure out that my gasket was shot, among other things. They walked me through what the problem was, and demonstrated how they came to the conclusion, showing me all the signs and symptoms. 

The part's alone would have been more than my truck was worth so I made the decision to scrap it. As I have never dealt with something like this before, K.C. was very helpful in explaining how I go about getting rid of my now junk vehicle. 

All this took place over the course of two days with me even leaving my vehicle there overnight and they didn't ask me for a dime. They spent hours with me and seemed more interested in helping someone in a rough spot than trying to make money. As long as I'm in Las Vegas, I wont go anywhere else for auto repairs."
2.5,5,This place is fantastic. I am most pass it up because of peoples reviews but I decided to take a chance I took my golf stream in there to be serviced and they were quick and prompt about it. I was walking over killing time in looking at the newer campers the sales team was non-pushy and informative I did not buy a new camper today because mines only 10 years old I still Got a few years left in her. But I deafly will come back no complaints here. I am a local person from Northeast Ohio
2.5,2,"I can find better pricing and selection at General in Canton, The sales team would rather be outside smoking and the service could care less if you you purchase their service or not."
2.5,1,"So, my RV is located on a seasonal site close to the streetsboro facility. I need some warranty work done. The service department on multiple occasions has informed me that they would send someone to look at the issue. After weeks of nobody showing up and exchanging multiple e-mails I decided to call. The person on the phone told me that I needed to bring it to them and that the problem I'm having is not under warranty. I was once again told that they will correct my issues with nothing more than a run around. It seems to me that once they sell you a unit and have your money, they are done with you. I'm definitely going to sue this outfit. BUYER BEWARE!!"
5,5,"I was rear ended and then I scraped the side of a wall. I called many body shops for estimates, and they all say the same thing, ""We need to replace both bumpers.""  However, I don't believe this is true. Why replace a perfectly good bumper if it can be repaired.  Bumper Masters is one of the many companies I called.  I decided to go with Bumper Masters because, Les, the owner, is so nice, polite, and easy to work with. I was quoted a price that was very reasonable; it was less than those big body shops where they do a lot of overpriced insurance work.  So I dropped my car off Friday afternoon, and by Saturday afternoon it was ready for pick up. Literally one-day service!  Not only that, but my car looks like there was never any damage. I really like my car, even though it's older, and I feel like I have a new car!  So if you are looking for somebody who is honest, and not trying to up-sell, or make unnessary repairs, I can definitely recommend Bumper Masters.  I took pictures of my car so you can see the damage and what kind of repairs I had done."
5,5,"Over the summer, we had to park in a tight spot near an old stucco wall.  We cut it too close one night and the entire front corner of my jeep's bumper was scraped up terribly.  I went to the jeep dealership and ended up leaving due to cost and the lengthy time my car would need to stay there.  I began making calls and stumbled upon Les.   I was hesitant at first of an at-home car repair company, but when I communicated with other reviewers and met Les, I knew I was in honest, skilled hands!!!  NOT only did I get my car back in a day 1/2, with paint that matched EXACTLY right, but it looked beautiful!  This is a talented man.  If you have a scrape, scratch or chip - no matter the size, he can fix it in a little over a day at a reasonable price.  A gem of a find and a good guy!"
5,5,"I was in my Mini Cooper when I was hit from behind by a full size car and pushed in to a truck. Luckily the other car wasn't going to fast, so there wasn't a ton of damage, but I took it to 2 body shops, and they wanted to replace both bumpers for over $2k! I'm so thrilled to have found Bumper Masters. They repaired my bumper instead of replacing them, and the price was much more reasonable! And best of all, they look brand new, so when I turn it in at the end of the lease, I won't get dinged. Cannot recommend Bumper Masters enough!!!"
5,5,I recently got into a bit of a fender bender and Bumper Masters came to my rescue! They did a wonderful job with a very fast turnaround time and affordable pricing. My car looks as good as new. I will definitely be returning should I have a need in the future!
5,5,"My Acura MDX rear bumper was gouged and
scraped when someone back into us while waiting for a spot in a parking lot. I found Bumper Masters though Yelp with great reviews. So I called and spoke with Les. Brought the car to him on late Friday afternoon.  I picked up the car on Sunday afternoon. It looked brand new.  Les was more than accommodating to my schedule."
5,5,Had two quotations from body shops and Bumper Masters came it at less than a third. Les was really great to work with. The final result was outstanding. Could not tell that any work had been done. Also got my car in 2 days and the body shop told me 2 weeks. Hope I don't have the need but if I do these are my go to guys. Highest recommendation.
5,5,Leslie is so friendly and has gotten so many dents out for me over the years! I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a car or bumper repair!!
5,5,Bumper masters did a great repair on our rear bumper. Looks brand new. Also very reasonably priced and quick turnaround. Very happy with the service we received. Thanks for the great work.
5,5,"I have taken my car to Bumper Masters numerous times.  I have a 2005 Nissan Murano which I have managed to keep looking like new thanks to the meticulous work I have received.  And even better, I usually have my car back the next day after paying a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend this business if you are looking for great work, do not want to pay exorbitant prices, or be without your car for days."
3.5,4,"What a wonderful surprise!  I'd been thinking, ""Camping in the city?  Are you kidding?""  ...but Glen Rouge is a very clean, well maintained and guarded campground.  I never felt our stuff was in jeopardy by leaving our campsite unattended.

The facility has very clean and well-lit restrooms and showers, a laundry facility, and an outside sink in which to wash your dishes.  We camped in the tents-only zone, but the park also has an area for RV's with power and water hookups.

Glen Rouge Campground is nestled alongside the Rouge River, and the associated park has some wonderful hiking trails that can take from 15 minutes to two hours.

All in all, it was a wonderful place to spend a couple of nights!"
3.5,3,"I checked it out this Sunday afternoon after 4pm, after many campers had checked out.  Glen Rouge Campground is currently owned and run by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA).  It is a fully serviced campground, meaning each site has electricity.  In addition, there are water taps on campground.  There is 1 very clean and spacious comfort centre with toilets and individual shower stalls (hot and cold water).  The campground is not large.  I think there are fewer than 40 sites.  All of them are suitable for RV and trailer.  The vegetation is short, so the privacy is not good.  The ground is grass covered.  Some sites have fire pits, some don't.  

This is early in the season, so the condition of the ground and various facilities are top notched.  I don't know the level of traffic this campground gets, but I suspect it is mostly used as a RV stop over, and is an affordable and competent one.

There is not much to do in the park, other than hiking on many of the trails.  Rouge River runs along one side of the campground.  This, however, is the lower bend of the river, so the water is brown in colour, and I won't dare to fish or do much in the water, not that the TRCA would like the campers to.

It is a nice surprise to see such a well maintained and affordable campground in the city.  It is inadequate in terms of activaties when compared to wilderness park like Killarney, or natural environment parks like Algonquin.  On the other hand, being a campground in the middle of an urban city, Rouge Park provides a nice escape from a busy reality."
3.5,4,"A beautiful Park near the city with plentiful trails.   It's almost impossible to get lost on a nice sunny day, even if you wander off the trails.  Just be careful in the summer for poisonous tall weeds.   Luckily there are signs with photos so you don't end up with severe burns to your skin.   Parking can be sparse when the weather is nice outside, so try to carpool if you can."
4,5,"This is a top notch organization. By far the most professional RV shop I have come across. The premise itself is pretty incredible, even offering plug in service if you need to stay overnight in your RV. Staff was top notch. Both friendly and professional. Had warranty work done and they could not have made it easier."
4,5,"Top class organization and location. I only use Cummings to service my RV's Diesel engine and generator. I've been to their locations in Avondale AZ, Boise ID, Coberg OR, and San Diego CA. Each time I receive top rated service and hospitality for a fair price. Highly recommend this location in Avondale."
3,5,"We had an excellent experience with all the Going Places RV team. We flew in from New England and had a fifteen day family trip around National Parks covering 2300 miles. From the check in with Jim, to the vehicle briefing with Luis (particularly helpful and useful advice on all matters) to the owner, Renee, who helped us at every juncture when we had to ask the odd question or clarification on the road. Having responsive and helpful communication was such a large relief for us. Our two young boys loved the experience and want to rent the same vehicle again. All in all we thoroughly recommend."
3,5,"My wife and I were fortunate enough to rent from Going Places RV for this years Country Thunder trip. The office staff (Jordan) and the service staff (Dustin, Louis) were extremely friendly, helpful and courteous. I will rent from the Going Places RV team in the future and would recommend you do the same for your RV or trailer needs."
3,5,"I rented a Class A motorhome from them a couple weeks ago and I must say it was one of the best rental experiences we have had.  This will be the 3rd time I have rented an RV, and I have to say they are the best we have dealt with in the business.  From start to finish everything went really smooth.  Really reassuring when traveling from Portland Oregon to Phoenix Arizona to rent an RV.   I plan on renting another one next year from them as well.  Thanks again and keep up the good work."
3,1,"My first experience with Going Places RV was great. For a year I sent this company more business and referrals than they could possibly imagine because they took care of me after another company (backroads rv) lied and attempted to screwed me. This year, with changes made to the business, it was ALL down hill.  I am a firm believer that you have to strike when the iron is hot, and play the supply and demand game. But when you start charging DOUBLE your normal rates when special events are in town (Nascar, Country Thunder, etc). Shame on you and It's time to Boycott. Do yourself a favor. Save your money find another company."
3,1,"Stay far away from this place! My family and I had a terrible experience! The RV we reserved was dirty and it still smelled like cigarettes! The carpets were dirty, and the restroom was no  clean. The only thing I can think of is this RV had JUST come back from being used and they simply put it back out front with out giving it a second look! It was simply not acceptable. Especially for what they charge. When I tried to speak to the owner/ manager she was very evasive. This was close to 10 days ago and I have yet to hear back from them. In the future please consider your family, I am embarrassed. My family trusted me to pick out a nice and clean RV and I trusted that this place would at least make sure of that. We spent most of the trip concerned about the filthiness of our unit, that should be the last thing a consumer should worry about. Please beware of this place."
3,4,"I hope people read this review as probably the most balanced due to the fact that the overall vacation was a complete bust but this place, the managers, the owners, and the employees are absolutely tremendous and in the face of significant vehicular adversity did the right thing by the customer. 

Many reviews - the low ones - tend to be completely incapable of bifurcating between acts of God/things completely out of control of the establishment... and the establishment itself.

Those people are morons. 

Here's the bottom line:

The RV itself was the top-of-the-line and nearly brand-new all things considered and I planned to take it on a five-day trip north to Sedona with my family including a three and one-year-old. 

The short version of this dumpster fire of a story is that both the generator went out and could not be restarted as well as the dashboard air conditioning unit leaving myself, my wife, and my two young daughters pretty screwed two hours north of Phoenix in 115° heat over Father's Day. 

You know what? The owner and every single one of the employees over a holiday weekend (!!!) went out of their way to do everything in their power to make things were right both in terms of during the adversity and after when it was time to pay the bill. I cannot say enough about the fact that a company is measured by the acts and ethics of their employees and not by things out of their control.

So for every one of these reviewers who blames the company on very expensive vehicles which they themselves simply maintain to the best of their ability and do not own and, moreover, rent  out to get beaten up by knuckleheads who should be driving a Prius instead... I say I'd like you to run any RV company better because I'm damn sure you couldn't. 

Going Places RV turned A complete train wreck of an adventure into something tolerable and something which was handled professionally and with as much care and pathos as possible. 

THAT is the hallmark of a good company. 

4/5 stars"
3,1,"My husband and I rented a travel trailer from this place on Labor Day weekend. It had lots of cosmetic damage.  Two months later my credit card was charged another 100 dollars. When I spoke to the owner she told me we bent the stabilizer jack. That was one of the many things already broken on it. She told me she is charging me anyway. They said they would inspect it and call us. They never did. When I spoke to her about it she was very rude. I informed her I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau . She told me ""I hope you do!"". Lesson learned. We will never rent there again. I took pictures of the trailer before and after. It will be useful when I contact the Better Business Bureau."
3,5,"Rented the Hurricane #3 from going places RV from August 1st through August 7th 2015.  Pick up was a breeze - Renae oriented me to the vehicle which took about 30 minutes.  I never RV'd before so did some research on you tube about the hookups (grey water and black water) before picking up - this helped.  Renae was knowledgable and was great to work with during the orientation.  I traveled with a family of 5 (2 adults and our 3 kids 10, 12, 13).  This was a perfect size RV easy to drive and comfortable to sleep in.  We visited the Grand Canyon south rim and Lake Powell - we had a blast.  Drop off was easy and we had no unexpected additional charges.  I would definitely rent from going places rv again."
3,1,"Unfortunate that Jordan was not the staff on hand that weekend. He is only going off claims from his unhelpful employees. You would think he might give the customer a little more customer service. But just like his staff they don't seem to know want that is. He took his employees word and dismissed mine. Rene yelled at me and cursed at me untill I finally hung up the phone. That is not a responsive way to talk to a customer.
I did not deny them entry. They came once attempted to fix it and it did not work. When they came again we were not there. And the bedding not being the amount we ordered, he refused to accept that maybe they made a mistake. Things like that happen sometimes. I was offered a $50.00 discount that's all. That doesn't even reimburse me for the bedding that was not provided. I denied the discount because I was insulted that Jordan would not at the very least underatand not only were there problems with the water but there was not the correct number of bedding. Your skin and hair doesn't smell after a clean water shower."
3,1,"Truly one of the worst travel experiences I have ever had. We travel often, have stayed in hotels, RV and trailer rentals, and vacation homes. The customer service was fine untill we had an issue with the rental. Renae the ""manager"" is lacking in her customer service skills to say the least. Rather than simply  assist us with the minor issues that could be fixed she placed blame and made everything someone else's fault. Our biggest problem was the ""fresh "" water.  It was not fresh or clean. It smelled horribly like sewer. So horrible that when we showered in it we smelled like sewer after. When we addressed this with them she claimed to have come out to our location twice to address the issue however they did not. We ended up getting a hotel room just to have a clean shower. Also we requested bedding for 4 and only received bedding for one. I emailed Jordan upon our return home requesting that he consider a discount to our bill due to the water and bedding situation and lack of courteous customer service from his staff. He denied our request and charged us the full amount for our stay.  Basically they did not provide what I paid for or what they advertised. They do not put clean water in the units. I feel the water was probably never drained from the previous rental  or several rentals before us and the water basins not properly sanitized. Save you money a ghetto motel would be a better option."
3,1,"This is the WORST RV company we have ever rented from! They tell you a quote on the phone then add 4% to cover their credit card merchant fee if you choose (like 99% of people in 2013 would) to use a credit or debit card. Then they say the gas tank will be full; it wasn't. The list goes on & on but we went back after we returned to confirm they I elected the RV & everything was good. They said it was fine & then charged my card an additional $90!! If you absolutely MUST use this shady company, USE CASH so they can't keep taking your money!! They can't be trusted!! D- ON THE BBB WEBSITE!!"
3,1,"Going Places RV Rentals came to my family's rescue when we arrived in Phoenix, AZ, but that heroism was short lived.  Our initial company couldn't supply us with our RV the last minute and after calling many places GP was the one company that had an RV available for the dates we needed. Being a last minute rental we agreed to pay for their insurance and to pay the 3% fee for using a credit card.

We had never driven an RV before. When you get into the RV you are given a five-minute walk-through on how to use the millions of buttons and gadgets that come with this 35-foot beast. They do not provide you with so much as an instruction manual to help you in getting up and running. If you have a problem you have to call - but be aware that nobody picks up the phone before 10am and after 5pm. 

On a hot 120-degree day on our way from Grand Canyon to Las Vegas the generator kept shutting off while driving.  Many calls were made to the company for guidance but all we received was a ""we will get back to you"" message over 4hrs. It was extremely hot and my 74YO mother was in the RV devoid of A/C. By the time we arrived in LV nothing had been resolved and they suggested that we have the oil in the generator checked. 

Once in LV we plugged in at the RV Park (so as not to have to rely on the generator) the A/C was blowing HOT air and the circuit breaker kept tripping. We called one last time before they closed at 5pm and DEMANDED that a repairman come and fix the problem. Alan, the repairman from ""At your service"" finally came and made some temporary fixes (it wasn't the generator malfunctioning but a glitch in the A/C that kept tripping the breaker and shutting off the generator), allowing us to sleep comfortably that night. The following afternoon was just as hot and just like that (we didn't even go near the thermostat but later were blamed for user error) the A/C started blowing HOT air again.  Being a Saturday the company wasn't able to get a repairman out there so they told us to turn the unit off and offered to put us up in a hotel for the night. The following day we were off to Lake Havasu, as we needed to break the trip up from LV back to Phoenix, not thinking that my elderly mother could survive a six-hour drive straight through to Phoenix in a non-A/Cd RV.  GP again offered to put us up in a hotel and made the arrangements in their name and credit card. 

When we arrived back in Phoenix GP was overly apologetic for us not having A/C for the previous three days. They said that they would look into reimbursing us for the days where the RV wasn't functioning properly, refund taxi rides to and from the RV parks to the hotels, and even pick up meals since we weren't able to cook our food. They even handed us $200 in restaurant.com vouchers to help smooth things over. We were ready to chalk this up to an experience and the one that we would never attempt again. 

That's when things went even further south. Upon our arrival to the airport,
Renee (the owner) sent a number of text messages stating that the A/C was currently working perfectly fine.  She made insinuations that whatever went wrong when we were on the road was due to user error and not anything else. We drove and worked the RV for four day perfectly, but all of a sudden we didn't know how to work it?  It plain and simply wasn't functioning properly while we were out in the blistering 120-degree LV heat.

A few days later I check my credit card and found charges that were not authorized.  Because the A/C was currently working we were now responsible for the hotel charges ($388) that they offered to put us up in. Not ethical in the first place, but don't you think that a company that was supposed to be reimbursing you for your rough ride would give you a call stating that they were now charging you instead of reimbursing you?

In addition to the hotel charges, they placed $1000 worth of undisclosed damages on my credit card. You would think that there would be a phone call or an email explaining any additional charges associated with the rental if there was damage, etc.  I called Renee to see what was going on and she was by far the most unpleasant and condescending person to deal with over the phone. According to Renee it was an estimate but now weeks after returning the RV I am still waiting for an actual invoice and pictures proving the damage. It's simply unreasonable not to have everything documented before handing it over to another person where they could potentially (if there was any damage to begin with) be doing even more damage. 

As a family we made the most of our vacation in horrific circumstances. But everything having to deal with Going Places RV Rentals proved to be a nightmare.  If you are set on taking your family vacation in an RV, do yourself a favor and use a different company.  Do your research and make an informed decision but if you ride with them you are basically just throwing your money away."
3,4,"We had such a great experience with ""Going Places RV Rentals"" from what could have turned out to be a nightmare! We were told we would get the RV at 10:0am in the morning and go thru the check out, which is to take about an hour and half. The owner is super friendly & professional- She was there at the desk when we checked in. Her staff was equally accommodating & friendly. Once we started the process, we saw the RV we booked online, and it was the exact one. All looked good. At the very end, our tech turned on the AC to make sure it worked..and BOOM! It did not work. We were shocked. We had to get on the road or we would really be behind. So the tech said he would consult with another tech and see if they could fix it on the spot. We asked how long would that take? He said..about an hour? We said..Wow..that's really going to put us behind on our trip. Can we talk with the owner or the gal up front? The gal up front came out, took one look a the broken AC unit, and said, "" Guys, I have a bigger RV that I can place you in, so you two can get on your way""!  She was wonderful! Of course, we were psyched, because the replacement was gorgeous and we felt like their problem did not become our problem. The gal got us in our RV within 15 minutes and we were GONE! We had one of the best trips of our life...and the RV was perfectly maintained and smooth the entire week long trip! Upon our return, they were very accommodating, as we had to comeback on a Sunday, when they are closed. The owner was exemplary and met us on a Sunday to hand in the RV. We felt bad. We thanked her for her incredible service and told her we would rent from her again. The next time we had to rent, they were sold out, due to our last minute preparedness..and we rented from an individual...OMG! What a WRECK that RV turned out to be! Never again! So we promised ourselves we will always rent from Going Places RV when our trip calls for an RV!"
3,1,It's been a year since we rented the trailer from you. I'm not sure why you are contacting me now. You were down right rude and unprofessional.  There are no deals to work out. You already ripped off my credit card. As I said a year ago lesson learned and we won't rent from you again.
3,1,"We rented one of their rv's to take our FOUR kiddos to The Grand Canyon over 4th of July this year.  We won't make that mistake again.  Neither TV's audio was working and they knew that when we picked up rig.  Told us it was probably the DVD player, so we hooked up r's and still no sound.  We had 2 duck tape a speaker bar 2 the tv then run extension cord ghetto taped 2 ceiling so the kids could actually hear their movies on the long drive.  This place didn't even pro rate the daily fee.  Junk!"
3,5,We have rented from Renae before and wouldn't rent from anyone else! Their customer service is amazing and are great about getting anything fixed!
3,5,"Truly a pleasant experience with no big dealership hassles. The rig we bought was exactly as advertised. Andrew was very nice to deal with, Kenny and his staff went the extra mile  to fix a few things that needed to be done without hesitation. We drove 2 hours each way to see the rig and then again to pick it up. Well worth the drive. Two thumbs up !"
3,3,"Up-date from my previous entry on 6/24/2015. The owner of Auto Boss has contacted me and graciously has made reparation for repairs, replacement parts and labor costs that I incurred during the past 8 months of ownership of the Coach my wife and I purchased there. Joy and I want to thank Andrew for the compensation that he provided with no questions asked. It was very well received at our end."
3,1,"Lock up your valuables!!! My 81 year old stepdad brought in his very nice and very expensive A Class for a minor repair right before his summer trip. My step father had $1,500 in American Express gift cards he had purchased for his gas expenses for the trip, and the came up missing when he got his RV back. It was a mistake leaving them in there to begin with but it is theft, plain and simple. When my stepdad brought it up to the owner, he tells him ""This is a family business, this could never happen here"" and ""These are serious charges you're making"". He told my stepdad he didn't believe him and hung up. The owner didn't give two bits. My stepdad is super honest and wouldn't make this claim if it weren't true. Nothing we can do about it now but share this experience. The thief knows what he did and karma is a b!t€h."
3.5,5,"Mike went above and beyond to help us with a problem with our hitch, even called the manufacturer for us.   We've been there a few other times for maintenance, and also to install solar on our trailer.  Great service!"
3.5,1,"Would give this place -1 star if I could.  NEVER EVER set foot in this place.  I will not go into detail about my experience but let's just say If they are recommended to you ask for a second option, even if you have to drive across town."
3.5,1,"This was the first time I used Bell Road RV for service, and firmly believe they have too much work to provide quality service.

I had four service requests for my toy hauler, and it took approximately 2 weeks and multiple phone calls to get a quote back.  Two of the four items were selected to complete:  replace the spare tire carrier which had failed and replace the fender skirt on one side of the trailer that was damaged in a tire blowout.  There was no communication from Bell Road RV over the next six weeks, except for when I called them - commitments to call me back were never followed through with.

The end result: after two months and a $1200 bill the wrong fender skirt was used that dips down about two inches below the trailer, as they could not locate the right part.  I was notified of this issue the day before I scheduled the pickup.  Additionally the spare tire carrier was installed but has three different rods to operate the crank as no single rod works well.  It didn't feel good to pay the bill but I wanted the trailer back.

Getting it back was a problem.  Pickup was scheduled for Saturday, when I arrived if saw that the master power switch was left on and the batteries were dead so  I manually cranked the trailer tongue lift with a hand crank.  Other trailers in the area were on shore power maintaining their batteries, apparently my trailer didn't rate high enough for that service.  Next I found the tongue jack was set directly on the ground, not the block of wood I left with the trailer when it was dropped off.  The trailer wasn't high enough to get on the hitch without the block, so a service rep had to lift the trailer with a forklift, add a new block of wood (mine was 'lost') so I could hitch up the trailer.  It was only 108 degrees outside that day, no problem.  To add a final issue, when the trailer was home I attempted to charge the 18 month old batteries only to find they had a dead short and have to be replaced.  Add another $250 to the bill for new batteries.

The search for good RV service continues, and I'll definitely be sharing this story...."
3.5,5,"I just want to thank the guys at Bell Road RV for fabulous yearly service on my Four Star living quarters horse trailer. The safety check found issues that affect my safety and were unknown to me! Tom kept me informed as to when it might be done ! Quality service! Expensive, yes, but you get what you pay for! When I am hauling my horse through middle of nowhere Nevada, I want to know that mt trailer is in great shape!  
Thank you Bell Road RV!!!"
3.5,5,"We are restoring a 1962 Shasta Travel Trailer, and I took it here to have the bearings in the axle repacked and sealed, for long excursions, and just because it's so old. Extremely friendly & knowledgeable service people, very trustworthy and thorough. My bearing have an older type seal, and rather than putting the old one back on they searched around town for the new, old style, to do the job correctly. Seems they work on anything as well, from giant, 300-thousand dollar motorhomes to travel trailers, campers, pop-ups, etc."
3.5,5,"Last August we decided to add a towed vehicle to our motorhome (a toad) and after reading articles and advice on the Internet was completely confused. I looked online for a local source of information and found Bell Road RV.  Mike spent an enormous amount of time with me explaining the different options in hitches and especially explaining the choices of suitable vehicles to tow. Once we settled on the hitch and vehicle, and made the vehicle purchase, they had us on the road in two days.
We found the staff to be friendly and a gold mine of information. It's time to have my motorhome serviced and I wouldn't go anywhere else."
4.5,5,"I purchased a consigned rv over the phone from Nanci at Wagon Wheel. One the phone Nanci talked to me like we were old friends. She offered to pick us up at the airport/or hotel. Upon arriving I found the rv to be everything I hoped and more. Nanci showed us the rv and kept apologizing that the rv was ""dirty"". It would be detailed and ready the next day at 10:30 am. Not only was it beautifully detailed (even the engine had been cleaned) bit they had topped of the diesel but filled the L P tank. Nanci took several hours to do the walk thru and answered all of our questions. When we ready for lunch she offered her personal car for us. She also let my son-in-law drive me to the airport, as she wasn't sure the rv would be to tall for the airport terminal. Even though the rv was on consignment and neither the dealer nor Nanci made as much commission as they would have if the  rv was theirs, I was still treated very well. This as my second rv purchase so I had previous experience with dealers,walk thrus and customer service. There was no detail to small for Nanci and the dealership. Nanci is even going to send me a new cap for the LP tank. I was also given a new water hose, a new dump hose and a supply of chemicals for the tank. Nanci made sure all the owner manuals and papers were complete. In summary, I was thrilled and overwhelmed with the rv, the service, Nanci, and the dealership, Should I ever need to buy another rv, it will be from Nanci and Wagon Wheel.
                        Thank you,
                                  Murray"
4.5,5,"I started looking at the Leisure Travel Vans about a year ago.  I came across Wagon Trail about 6-8 months ago by calling on their ad from an online rv site. John answered the phone despite the after hour call and took care to answer all questions.  The focus was on what I wanted to do with the vehicle, not upselling or pushing any additional modifications.  In fact, the opposite.  There was zero sales pressure with an emphasis on establishing a long term relationship from sale of the right vehicle for our needs, delivery, training and service.

Pricing was more than fair and direct.  There were no add on charges or surprises.

John worked with us on delivery to accommodate work schedules outside of their normal hours and even offered pick up from the airport or hotel.  Dinner recmmendations were unique with terrific food and character.

Ryan worked with us for almost four hours on what was his day off (a Saturday and his birthday) to thoroughly review all aspects of the vehicle. He took us over to a local RV park, checked us in (at their expense) and assisted in hooking up the vehicle.   Delivery even included a start up kit and two attractive mugs.  John was even available by phone the rest of the weekend to assist and answer questions. 

This was an entirely opposite experience than that of a dealer geographically much closer (La Mesa). This was well worth the travel in every way!  Extreme courtesy and attention to detail.  The ""right stuff""!"
4.5,5,"We are on number 3 in 13 months from Wagon Trail. They are the best of the best. That is why we keep returning. The team they have put together there is awesome. John, Rusty and everyone else. We were first time RVers and not only their honesty, but the confidence they instilled in us that we could drive these was wonderful. They just keep getting better. We highly recommend a stop there and a long look. You will be amazed at how low key and welcoming they will be!!!! Those looking for an RV owe it to themselves!!!!"
4.5,5,"I wish to commend Jennifer and Ben (and staff) for the beautiful repairs on our 2013 Triple E Motorhome. From the time we contacted them (from Colorado where baseball size hail had damaged roof, skylights, vent covers and hood of vehicle) to the completion time, we were treated with competent and courteous care.  Ben did an excellent job repairing the roof and installing the components, leaving everything better than it was before. Jen coordinated the project and assured that the parts and supplies were ordered and correct. Throughout the two months of work, Jen kept us informed of the progress and worked with our insurance company to be sure the work was authorized. Can't say enough how pleased we are with the results! Thank you, Van City, Las Vegas (formerly Wagon Trail RV.)"
4.5,5,"I was referred to Wagon Trail by Camper World.  This company sells quality vehicles.
I dropped in on Friday, unexpected.  Noel spent over an hour explaining all the details
of 4 different vehicles.  He also gently swayed me as to why one motor home might be
a better match for the type of traveling one does.  No pressure, and what a great sales
agent.  Noel knows it all, and he is honest and straightforward about helping a customer
make an informed decision and be completely satisfied in doing so."
4.5,5,"We just purchased a slightly used (less than a year old) Leisure Travelvan that was on consignment with Wagon Trail. Although this was a private party purchase, I cannot imagine being treated any better if we had bought a brand new special order RV. John, Daryl & Melanie helped in every way possible, up to and including making sure we had everything needed for DMV. Darren, Service Manager, went through the RV with us, taking all the time needed. They even topped up all the tanks and included all hoses and a starter kit as they do with the vehicles that they are selling. When we went to start looking, there was no pressure tactics. During the two weeks we were putting this together, all visits & phone calls were treated with courtesy and attention. We highly recommend them to both first time buyers and anyone looking to upgrade."
4.5,5,"We were RVers in the '70s as a young married couple (tooling around in a Ford Econoline camper conversion), but when children and careers began to dominate our lives, RVing took a back seat. We're now 65 and retired and had long promised ourselves to return to the adventure of RVing.  We were focusing on Class B units in the 25-foot range, feeling a bit like Goldilocks: not too big, not too small. We began dropping in on RV dealers in the Las Vegas area, where we live. Some lots had a few units in our size category, but not a ton, or they had a bunch from only one manufacturer, without any variety to compare and contrast.

Then we came upon Wagon Trail RV and our eyes bugged out -- such a collection of new and used Class B (and B+) units. In short order, we fell in love with and purchased a used, low-mileage, 25' Leisure Travel Van ""Libero."" The deal was done in days. But this isn't a review of the RV, but of the dealership. 

Our saleswoman, Nanci, was more of a guide, obviously taking a page out of the sales handbook: you don't need to sell something when all you need to do is be helpful in letting a buyer fulfill his/her dream by answering all their questions.  Nanci was patient as can be, mellow and savvy, and knew the answers to 98% of our questions. '

The next step was financing because we ain't rich. We called around to banks and credit unions to discuss home-equity and RV loans, but none could match the deal that Will in the finance office came up with. Melanie in the back office completed the paperwork allowing us to register the vehicle with the Nevada DMV the very day we drove off the lot. Bam, done deal, and we never felt like we were being taken advantage of. 

The day we took delivery, Steven in the service department spent two hours walking us through the unit and told us not to hesitate to call him with any and all questions. And then the dealership comped us a night at a local RV campground as a shake-down overnighter (and everything worked as advertised). 

Point being: We saw the greatest variety of Class B RVs at this dealership, and walking around the lot was relaxed and fun. The sales staff was not stalking us like buzzards on a phone line, and the finance guy was up front and efficient and on our side,  talking a lender into giving us a better deal than we could find anywhere else on our own.

I'm a retired journalist, my wife is a homemaker. We are normal people. We know this is a sweet review, and the reason is because these guys earned it. Simple as that."
4,3,"I've been to much better RV parks on military bases. The park has full hookups 30/50; their shore power shorted out our power cord and we had to go purchase a new one for $300 and they wouldn't reimburse us (when it was clearly their fault, our cord was new). I think this is kind of crappy, since we are staying on a base they feel they shouldn't be held responsible?? We moved spots and with our new cord everything is going well. 

The wifi is the most awful wifi on the planet. In this day in age we stream, we download and we need to watch Netflix!! I've been to other base famcamps and they use the local cable company for wifi and it's awesome. With that, if they did provide local wifi and cable through cox, we could just pay for internet ourselves (for the long term).  Here you're only allowed to check email and surf the internet; with that I can't hardly even check my email it never works. Don't even try opening Facebook it never works.  

The laundry facility is awkward and small. I think there's another one,  but the one closest to us is awkward to get into and if another person comes in after you, you're stuck in there until they leave. Really makes it awkward.  It's so weird. 

The cost is a little more than some other famcamps, which I'm really confused by that.  I've stayed at some great famcamps with all the amenities and great views. Here we have views of hospital, fuel storage and solar panels. They do have a great dog park but of course lazy people take their dogs in there and don't pick up after their babies. Sick. 

The famcamp is on the opposite side of the base from the BX and commissary. 


Lastly, the playground lord oh lord. It is old outdated and falling apart. It's the most awful playground ever!! There's no cover on it either. This park isn't using their monies properly, they are adding more spots but are still lacking updates for the rest of the park."
4,5,Each and every time we stay here we are treated like royalty this place is Queen very secure and everything is brand new I am so happy every time we come here we have been brachial or shut out 4 times now they have a events and get togethers and everybody is extremely friendly very very very happy to be here each and every time
4,5,"Great, clean, safe place to stay!  Located on Nellis AFB, it's massive--well provisioned, well kept, and well staffed. Of note, it's not on the main side of base, so the commissary, gym, BX, and Nellis Club are all across Las Vegas Blvd."
4,4,"I have no comparison since this is my 1st RV Park. The RV Park personnel seem very nice and helpful. I am told that the amenities are standard. It's hard to beat a rate of $22 per day. Also, the washer and dryer loads are only $.75 per load. The gas station is less than a mile away. The RV Park is quiet except when we came back at 2am exhausted and I accidentally set off both the car and RV sirens!!! How embarrassing as it took me too long to turn them off. Thankfully, none of the RV Park guests came out to yell at me. If they had, I deserved it. This place has a nice dog trail and plenty of doggie bag and trash stations spread throughout the property. My only area for improvement is their wifi; many connections available but the bandwidth is so slow. My mobile phone LTE is much faster. I would recommend this place for the price and cleanliness. I even got to see a rainbow today; photo uploaded ;D"
4,3,"I don't have much experience with other RV parks, and would love to give 5 stars but for a few things.

The RV park is clean and nicely located just 20 minutes from the main strip.   The neighborhood is not good, but the park is located on base, near the hospital.   They offer partial and full hookups and most sites have concrete pads to park on.   Electricity and water are very stable (although they are currently working around construction to expand the park).  You can stay for 6 months at a time, and after 30 days away, you are welcome back.

Bathrooms by tent sites have 2 showers and 2 toilets.   In the main camp area, there are 5 individual bathrooms (toilet, sink and shower) along with laundry facilities.  Some days the bathrooms are very clean, other days, not so much.

The WiFi is horrible.   You can't depend on it and in fact, can't update Windows on your computer because it uses 'peer-to-peer' updating by default.   If you are caught using anything that is 'peer-to-peer' you will be prosecuted.  At least they tell you that at check-in.

The ants.   They are everywhere.   Thankfully you'll also see chipmunks, rabbits lots of birds, and the occasional stray cat.   Some irresponsible and cold-hearted camper left the cats behind several years ago.   You aren't allowed to feed them, and they generally keep their distance from humans who have hurt them before.

The staff.  Some are very helpful, some only work for the free site.  The staff are everywhere, and they watch what people do.   If you have a drop of water at your site, they will knock on your door, no matter the hour.   We love Andy, he has been very helpful and we are sorry that this is his last month working here.   Others have been understanding, but unfortunately not all of them.  Some are no longer ""Happy Campers"".

What are these other reviews talking about when they say how quiet it is??  HAHA!!!  You are staying on an Air Force Base with LOTS of jet and helicopter activity.   You are also located just a couple miles from the NASCAR track which hosts mostly noisy activities.  Be prepared to hear ""the sounds of freedom"" if you choose to stay here.

Monthly discounts would be awesome.   But not available here.  The park fills up in the winter, due to snow-birds.   If you don't have a reservation, you'll be put on a waiting list to move from partial to full hookup."
4,3,"Trees need trimmed back from camper areas. We had limbs on top of our slides, we were very concerned with damage when the winds began to pick up. 
We reported this to the office, who basically blew us off. 

Previous camper had dumped a bag of bird seed in front of our spot.  Non stop pigeons not charming making their mess. 

No WiFi unless you go to the office. 

We had no idea the neighborhood was so rough if you left the campground at night."
4.5,5,"I needed a 5th wheel hitch installed in my GMC 2500HD.  My neighbor referred me to these guys after having them install a Pullrite Superglide in his truck.  I had them install a Pullrite Superglide, as well, with the removable rails.  I dropped my truck off in the morning and got it back in the afternoon (which is about how long it takes to install this hitch).  When I picked up my truck they went over how to use the hitch, maintenance, etc and if I ever had any questions they told me to call them.  Good service.  Hitch has been working great.  I'd use them again."
4.5,5,"The guys at Lewis Hitches are great!!  After doing some research, talking to them, and reading their reviews from other satisfied customers, we drove from NW Phoenix to buy our fifth-wheel hitch and have them install it!  They did a great job! Their price was lower than other quotes we got, but honestly it was their great reviews by satisfied customers that made the drive out to Chandler worth it for us!"
4.5,5,Richard was great to deal with. He gave me a quote over the phone and appointment. When I arrived for my appointment he took the truck in immediately and is was done in the time frame he told me. I would highly recommend for hitches and/or air bags.
4.5,5,"Been going here for years, by far the best Service and Best Quality work for trailers and hitches in AZ!! Always fair prices and best quality work around!! I highly recommend Lewis Hitches for any trailer or hitch needs!!!"
4.5,1,"Upon first meeting both Richard (Owner) and Eric (Employee) I thought they were going to be able to help me out without an issue.  I explained to Richard that I had recently purchased a used RV 5th Wheel, that I need the used 5th wheel hitch that came with the RV installed in the bed of my truck and that I was new to operating a 5th wheel.  I would need rail and brace kit that would fit my truck install and then the used Husky 16KW 5th Wheel Slider/Glider hitch install. I dropped my truck off and waited for the installation to be done and was called 3 hours later upon completion. I picked up the truck and figured everything was just fine and no additional instruction was given.  Now know that I was new to 5th wheels you'd think they would've given me a little instruction but none was given.  I met with the seller of the 5th wheel trailer I purchased where I was given very detailed instruction on to use the hitch.  I knew how to properly hook up and disconnect and how to use the slider and why the slider was so important with my 6ft.6"" short box. I was told make sure you have the hitch in the rear position when making and tight turns or maneuvers. I drove my trailer home for the first time. I approached my driveway and did as instructed and moved my slider hitch into the rear position for maneuvering a tight turn while backing into my driveway. AS I BACKED UP THE HITCH SLID FORWARD AND SHATTRED THE BACK WIDOW OF MY BRAND NEW TRUCK. Why did this happen?  Upon further investigation I found that the 5th wheel hitch that I just paid for to be installed by Lewis Hitch a supposedly professional  hitch installation shop had not inspected it properly or adjusted my hitch to the manufactures specs.  I called Husky (the manufacture) and their technical people helped me through the problem. Husky technical professional told me that adjustment on the slider mechanism is required on every installation and should be provided by any professional hitch installation shop whether new or used. I took my truck to Cliff's Welding in Mesa and Wes there helped me adjust the slide mechanism so that the hitch would lock both in the forward position and rear position. This took just 5 minute and I assisted Wes so I could learn exactly how to perform this procedure. 5 Min for me to do it!  Wow!  It probably would've taken a professional less than 2 minutes to make this adjustment.  I asked Wes at Cliff's Welding if his company would have set up the hitch even though it was used making sure it locked in both directions and given it a full inspection. Wes's response was ""Dean, that's just part of a normal installation. We do not want you to drive out of here and have a problem and for anyone to get hurt or any property to be damaged."" 
 I called and talked to Eric on the phone and he was very rude and cursed at me. I stopped back in to Lewis Hitch to pick up some metal parts and leave without any discussion. When I arrived I waiting in the lobby for 10 minutes when the staff had known that I was inside the office (because they have a buzzer). I finally walked into the shop where I had met Richard (the owner) again and said ""I'm here to pick up my metal work"". He said ""Do you have a problem!"". (Because he already knew that I'd gotten into it with Eric on the phone. I said ""Yeah I have a problem Eric was rude to me on the phone and you guys never inspected or adjusted my hitch and made use it worked properly. I relied upon Lewis Hitch to make sure everything was set up safely and correctly with my hitch and I paid you for that service and now I have a broken window on my truck."" Richard said ""You supplied a used piece of sh*t 5th wheel hitch and we do not take any responsibility for your used equipment."" I responded ""I called your competition and they said looking over any 5th wheel hitch that is used and provided by a customer and adjustment is standard to the installation at no additional cost and that they want to make sure the hitch is safe and secure"".  I asked ""why didn't you do this?"" Again the response from Richard was ""You supplied a used piece of sh*t 5th wheel hitch and we do not take any responsibility for your used equipment.""  I asked
for my metal parts so I could pay him and leave and Richard (the owner mind you) said ""Now your metal parts just cost you $200"".  I said ""What!?"" (knowing he only did about 20 minutes worth of work on those parts because all he had to do was drill three holes in a metal tube I provided)  ""Richard, those are my parts and that is my metal. Do I need to call the police???""  Richard then responded and said ""Here's your parts now Get The F*ck off my property.  
DO NOT BRING YOUR TRUCK OR TRAILER TO LEWIS HITCH FOR ANY REASON. RICHARD HAS A CARE LESS TYPE ATTITUDE AND IS A COMPLETE SHYSTER.
Shyster - a person, especially a lawyer, who uses unscrupulous, fraudulent, or deceptive methods in business."
4.5,5,"They correctly diagnosed and repaired an electric brake problem on my camp trailer. Honest skilled work at a fair price, with excellent communication. I highly recommend Eric and the guys at Lewis Hitches."
4.5,5,"So grateful I found this place. After going to another shop to service my horse trailer and they didn't have a clue.  The other shop didn't even know how to unhook the goose neck!   I needed someone fast, that knew what they were doing. I called Lewis Hitches and even though they were busy they worked me in.  They did a great job of servicing my trailer and at a reasonable price,  nothing was missed and the trailer was carefully inspected and maintained."
4.5,5,"Great experience.  I needed a commercial vacuum wheel dolly welded and i needed a new jack stand for my trailer. I dropped it off at noon.  Eric called me at 3 and said welding was done and he also went and picked up a new jack stand and that was ready as well. Price was more than right, less than he quoted me. I highly recommend them.

4.5,5,I have had multiple things worked on my trailer here. This is an old fashioned customer service place. They still believe in looking you in the eye and doing phenomenal work at extremely reasonable prices.
4.5,5,"I second all the good things said here. I had them put a hitch on my new truck--took an hour and works great first time out.  Later I needed a platform for a bunk in the bed after I put a topper on. After mulling over how I was going to do that, I took it to Lewis' and for a very reasonable price they built and installed.  I'm sure it's bombproof--very sturdy and well done.  Couldn't be more pleased.   I'll take any truck work/welding I need to this shop."
4.5,1,"I had a 5th wheel hitch installed on my Ford F-350 truck on Tuesday, January 30, 2018 at Lewis Hitches.  From what I see, the job was done well, at the cost I was quoted and Richard was very thorough in explaining it to me.  I picked my truck up that afternoon, drove directly home and backed it into my driveway.  The next day I went out to run an errand and noticed a dent in the right corner of my rear bumper and cracked paint on the right rear fender right next to the bumper.  Apparently the truck was hit quite hard to do that type of damage.
I immediately called Eric at Lewis Hitches and let him know what had happened.  I told him that I was the only person who had driven the truck, that I had come straight home without any incidents and was very upset.  My truck did NOT have a dent in the bumper nor cracked paint when I dropped it off, but it DID when I brought it home.  Eric's comment was that he could guarantee that it did not happen at their business. I told him again that I was the only person who had driven the truck in the week and a half that I had owned it and that I had no incidents at all let alone one that would have caused damage like that.  He repeated that he could guarantee that it did not happen there.  Pretty much calling me a liar. He did ask me to bring the truck by so they could look at it.

Today, Thursday, February 1, 2018, I brought my truck back to Lewis Hitches and showed Eric the damage.  Again, he said that it did not happen there and unless I could prove that they had done the damage there was nothing they would do. I explained that the dealer I had purchased the truck from a week and a half earlier had pictures that I could produce showing no damage and his comment was - well, that was a week and a half ago, unless you have pictures from when you dropped it off showing there was no damage, you can't prove that we did it.  
At that point I told him we were done talking and got in my truck and left.

My suggestion to anyone that is looking to get any work done by Lewis Hitches - take pictures of everything when you drop it off.  Their lot is cluttered with vehicles, campers and trailers and is very tight to move around in.  They themselves may not have damaged my truck, but customers are driving around in their lot, backing trailers around, etc. My truck was not damaged when I dropped it off, but was when I picked it up.  They were of no help in remedying the situation - and even insinuated that I was a liar."
4.5,5,"Fair prices, experienced installers, and the only one in the Phoenix area certified to install an execuhitch (invisible hitch). They did a nice job on the hitch install... I have yet to try it out with a trailer yet, but seems securely affixed."
4.5,5,"Juan was very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  He went out of his way to help me over the phone.  When that didn't work, he and his crew came to our location and fixed what turned out to be a simple problem without gouging the pocketbook.  He could easily have sold me a brand new part instead of fixing the existing part (which took only five minutes).  A very ethical and professional service.  If you are looking for a trustworthy repair service, 4 Points RV Service is worth the call."
4.5,4,"I am very happy with my experience with 4 Points Mobile RV Service.  They do excellent work.  I needed my trailer axles serviced and they were quick, thorough, and even found a few problems I didn't know I had.  Most other places I called were two weeks out on work but Vonda was great about getting my work done within a few days of my call.  I will use them again."
4.5,5,"Juan was AWESOME!  He got us and our coach out of a huge bind.  Good Sam dispatched a horrible repair guy that had no idea what he was doing. After getting nowhere with him, KOA recommended we call 4 Points and we were glad we did.  Juan showed up and got us temporarily back together in less than an hour.  Thank you for all your help Juan!  We will definitely tell people about our experience!!!"
4.5,1,"We had an appointment for Juan to come to our RV Resort 2 days ago,  to fix several items. ...but he never showed up OR called.  We placed 2 calls to his business # that morning,  & both went to VM.  Still haven't heard from him!"
4.5,5,"Can't say enough about Juan and 4 Points RV Service! We are doing a home remodel and living in our 5th wheel. The converter was having issues, smelled of melted plastic and was hot to the touch, kept tripping when the AC came on. I called several mobile RV services and left messages that were never returned. Juan answered the phone, advised that he was booked for several days (which I can totally understand in AZ during snowbird season), schedule and appointment for Tuesday 11/15 at 2:00. He called that afternoon and said he would be a few minutes early, he arrived, listened to my concerns, went through some troubleshooting steps and then completed the repairs. He was courteous, explained everything fully, was helpful with advice on how to do some things more efficiently than we were doing them and the price was beyond reasonable. Very satisfied with the service and value! Highly recommended!!!"
4.5,5,"Juan worked at the same RV dealership that I bought my 5th wheel almost 8 years ago. He is very knowledgeable and experienced in RV repair and maintenance. I wont trust anybody else to work on mine. As far as the first reviewer,all I can say is there must have been some glitch in the communication because he always answers the phone and is always on time! He just fixed my A/C and it is working great! Thanks Juan!"
4.5,5,We are very happy with our experience with 4 Points Mobile RV Service. The technicians are friendly and their prices were very fair. Fixed several small items on our rig including a generator exhaust that broke off.
4.5,5,Had a tin panel replaced on my 5th wheel after being hit by a semi. They did an outstanding job. I would not hesitate using then again. They will be coming back to replace our defective micro/ convection oven when it gets here. He called me every time the insurance company gave him a update and he informed me of when parts should be in. They were very through and honest.
4.5,5,"Our 12 volt solenoid went out and 4 Points was fast, courteous and reasonable.  Juan was very good at explaining the problem and saving us money.  Highly recommend them for any RV repairs."
4,3,"Things have changed a little at the Elks in Tempe so thought I would update a previous review I wrote.

The biggest change that is coming is a non-smoking clubhouse.  That's right, Folks.  The lodge voted and January 15th is the date it will be a non-smoking establishment.  

Update to follow."
4,5,"Great Lodge in the best traditions of the Order.
Great rates and nice folks; close to everything and easy in and out.
Lodge services are good and RV host's handout includes good local services available as well.
And the weather is phenomenal!"
4,5,"Amazing, Friendly & Safe... Dave & Cathy meet us when we pulled in and showed us the ropes... Way to go Tempe Elks....:-)"
3.5,5,I would highly recommend sending your child to Children's Safari Learning Center. We have had several teachers and have been more than pleased with every single one. We will have to say that Ms. Pam is by far our favorite. Her patience is endless and I can tell that teaching children is definitely her passion. The office staff is very efficient and warmly greet us every day. It definitely wasn't the closest to our home but after research it has been completely worth the drive. One of the best decisions we made for our 3 year old since moving from California to Arizona.
3.5,5,"I stayed at home with my son for his first year, then he went to his grandma to get watched, so putting him in a daycare was extremely hard for me.  I have heard horror stories so I was EXTREMELY picky in who I chose to leave him with.  I am so HAPPY I chose Children's Safari.  My son was having a hard time with his speech, and since going there he knows his letters, alphabet, numbers, and he won't stop talking now!  He is soooo happy there, and I just adore his teachers.  My son started when he was 2 years old, and turned 3 now so he will be moving up in classes soon.  They have been so helpful with potty training him as well, and I just can't thank them enough.  My friend also does photography for all the day cares, and when I told her who watched my son she said she was so happy I chose Children's Safari because they are in her top 3 day cares around the entire valley (Phoenix, Peoria included).  Children's Safari is not the cheapest, however the quality is there and that is what you are paying for.  I am a single mother so saving money is a must, but this is one expense I won't sacrifice.  My son will definitely be here until he goes to school.  Thank you Kathy and Children's Safari!!!!!"
3.5,5,"Children's Safari is top notch.  Their teacher-to-child ratios are lower than the state mandates, which is the number one reason I chose them to care for my son.  Plus, Kathy (owner) and Pamela (director) really, really care about the children.  They're nice, professional, attentive to detail, and pretty much all of the things you want in a daycare provider.  The facility is new and impeccably clean.  Everything is spot on.  I just can't say enough good things about them...."
3.5,5,We love Children's Safari.  With the cost of childcare being so high it is important to us that our children are given a great opportunity to learn and grow. All the teachers really care for the kids and do a great job. They are patient (our oldest daughter has an exceptional amount of energy). She was more than prepared for her kindergarten class. She has done so great after the Pre-K that we did not hesitate to enroll our new baby.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for childcare.  A great touch is all of the cute crafts the make with hands and feet. We love sharing these with grandparents.
3.5,5,This review is LONG overdue. Children's Safari was absolutely perfect for our kids. Kathy (owner) was so good to us along with the rest of the staff. We never had a problem there. Always available to talk with us about anything needed. Very accommodating regarding our needs for adding our little ones last sec for child care on certain non scheduled days. Very informative about the activities of the day. Always welcoming and polite and professional. So glad we made the decision to send our two boys to Children's Safari for the years we did. Had our oldest there for three years and our youngest was there from an infant to five years old. Thank you!! We love you Children's Safari!
3.5,2,"I enrolled my son (3) 1 month ago. I just recently pulled him out. When he first started, he would cry when I left, which I expected. But it continued for the entire month and tears at drop off got worse. He wouldn't only cry but would literally cling to me. Because of the difficult drop offs, I would call and ask how he was doing and his teachers (who were very young and didn't seem happy to be there) would respond ""fine"" and that was all. I also thought it was weird that every time I dropped off or picked him up (which was at different times), it was ""free play"" and description for the days activities that were sent home always said ""played"", nothing else. He wouldn't come home and be tired and would stay up extremely late, as if he didn't burn off any energy at all. Artwork was never sent home.. also weird. Long story short, I don't believe this to be a learning center as I didn't see much or any learning.. only playing.. while teachers just sat around watching. Everything there was just drab. I felt like there was ZERO excitement from the staff about anything. My son is now enrolled somewhere else close by and on his first day at drop off, he shed NO tears and hasn't since he started. Kind of ironic. Just makes me wonder what was going on. I gave 2 stars because of the security system they offer and Kathy, the director, was nice."
3.5,5,"My son has been going here for just about 1 year now. He started when he was 6 weeks old. As he was our first child, we were definitely nervous about leaving him with strangers. We immediately were relieved with the amount of professionalism and personal care that our son received from each teacher. He absolutely loves them. We can't thank Kathy and Wendy enough for not only making it easy on us, but really taking care of and loving our son. I highly recommend this place to all working parents!"
3.5,2,"So I am a former employee as of today, now the place isn't horrible to work at or anything of the sort but, I'm giving it 2 stars because 1: i got sick and called out 2 days, then after coming back and working for a bit was told that they smelt pet urine but only one person smelt it no one else I asked did and then after that was forced to take a 3 and a half week break. 2: upon coming back got sick again and took 2 days off to clear it up then back at work now I will admit I was late 2 times due to unavoidable accidents but I was late. Then a family emergency came up and I needed to leave early one day. And now somehow a rumor or telephone got out that said i was unhappy and looking for another job or whatever and instead or taking my word on how I felt the owner took the word of others. I was by no means unhappy with the preschool or anything. But to put another thing someone said performance was and issue and wait what? So performance but this is the first time I'm hearing about a performance when others have said they told the owner I was doing really well, so now unless everyone lied or the performance issue was a lie because I would think if performance was an issue I would have been talked to before being terminated at least that's how I would do it and how I was taught it was supposed to be done when I did manager training but so the whole issue is I was let go due to attendance and again they threw in the 3 and a half weeks I DID NOT want or ask for and a family emergency, performance that was NEVER mentioned before the let go, and rumors that did not come from my own mouth of me being unhappy. I loved this job but now I have to say due to how this played out in the end I want nothing to do with preschools anymore. I think I'm done with younger education because this just to me was shady and not okay. The reasons did not make sense and it was out of the blue. I wouldn't recommend working here."
3.5,1,"The school is painted in a dark, depressing green, with green, brown floors. No colors, no light...very scary to a child. The smell of dirty diapers was OVER WHELMING. I observed a teacher who knew I was watching her take care of 8 little kids on her own and she literally spent her time pulling toys out of their hands and walking around with a scowl on her face. It was dirty, smelly and depressing. I felt bad leaving the poor children behind when I left."
3.5,5,"Clean, safe environment. Great security system, although no option of viewing classroom remotely(for other children's privacy). Organized, friendly, compassionate staff and flexible with my husband's class schedule. Auto pay option is convenient or you can pay in person. The sign in computer system (scans fingerprint/asks for code) gives you alerts such as payments due. A newsletter, artwork, and a daily update sheet are sent home. They are also cloth diaper friendly, which rocks! Children are actually sent home when ill and I liked how they would keep lights off and provide soft toys while other children were still sleeping during nap time. We thought that providing our own food would be a pain, but it truly was not problematic. In fact, it was preferable for us so we could give him food of our choice, based on our son's diet and preferences. The center is quite affordable, too. My employer used The Employment Network, which have a 5% discount and waived enrollment fee.  See if your employer has a discount. 

When a long-time teacher left(loved Miss Pat!), there was a bit of a communication lapse with the gals in the room and my 2-year-old only had his diaper changed once that day. They let me know the mistake and apologized and it never happened again. Honestly, this is the only negative (one-time) concern that we had. He was bitten by another child once but they let us know immediately. Other than that, we felt strongly that our son was safe, treated with love and that staff is professional and held accountable. I always witnessed staff interaction with the kiddos and my son loved going here. When we would drop him, the kids would do a group hug. So cute! If I need to go back to work, we would bring him back here in a heartbeat."
2.5,3,"We stayed at this campground for three nights and here is my review of it.  I have a large Class A with tow vehicle.  The roads are very wide and no issue whatsoever maneuvering around within the camp.  

We checked in with a very pleasant staff at the office, who offered us advice of the area and explained the campground.  The restrooms, laundry and public/social spaces are just outstanding.  The grounds are spotless, and this is a combination full time mobile home park and RV park. If you are looking for Shady Acres, this is not the place for you.  There are no trees to speak of, but we were not spending time in the campground except to sleep, so it was not a problem with us.  Overall we found it super quiet and convenient being right off of I-17.  

We tried to do laundry after hours, but their is no change machine to get quarters. Also what I found odd was there was probably 40 empty spaces and we returned to find someone right next to us with 15 empty spaces to my right and five empty ones to my left - go figure? Also, no free Wi-Fi at the sites, you have to sign up and pay for it.  No picnic table at any of the sites."
2.5,1,"We stayed here last year for 6 months in the winter. It was so nice we decided to come back for 6 months this winter. We told them we were staying 6 months and they said no problem. They only give you a 3 month lease at a time but assured us there wouldn't be a problem to stay through May. So today my husband went to renew our lease through May 2018 and was informed they had rented the spot to someone else! We have to be out by noon tomorrow! The office personnel are rude and we will never stay here again. After calling 25 rv parks, we finally found one on short notice 100 miles away. These people are RIDICULOUS! Never again !"
2.5,1,After being promised we could stay until May 2018 we were told they rented our door right out from under us. We drove by today and there are still 3 empty spots. Really lousy thing to do to people!
2.5,3,"Stayed here for 8 nights.......this is what we experienced.  

Pros:

* Huge spaces.....we had not only our 35 ft camper, but plenty of room to park the truck and car
* Easy entrance / Exit 
* Great price/value
* Nice rocked camping sites.....no need to worry about the dirt tracking indoors
* Close to I-17.....and a short distance to the 303 and the 101 
* Fry's Food Store less than 2 miles away
* 2 exits north is a Walmart and what's left of the Outlet mall (which was a huge disappointment)

Cons:

* Zero Shade and too windy to use your canopy for shade

* Bathrooms and amenities were too far away to walk. They are located right in the middle of park.  

* No staff was available when we checked in, we tried calling and even walked around inside the building....but nothing.  We did end up in the wrong stop. But they left us there anyhow

* VERY noisy in the mornings.  There are permanent spots in the back, and each day......diesel trucks and Harley's drive back and forth.  So peak quite time is from 11pm to 6am. 

* Also......If you are bothered by guns shots, this may not be your place.......(personally it doesn't bug me).....there is Ben Avery Shooting Facility on the other side of the foothill."
2.5,1,"We have never had such a horrible experience with any other KOA, campground or hotel. Yes, you read that title correctly!!! Bed Bugs!!! We had contacted this KOA prior to checking in to arrange for a late check-in for a basic Kamping Kabin since our flight into Charlotte was going to arrive late at night. The owners said that they would leave the cabin key with the bar next door. That should have been a sign to us right there. Anyway, we arrive about 11:30pm, go to the bar and get the key as arranged. The waitress hands us the key and TV remote in a KOA bag and we go off in the night to find our cabin. We open the door and the smell of stale beer immediately hits us. On the bed, there are a couple of dead roaches. Its a little chilly since its late October, so I look for the heater. There's an air conditioner but no heater in the cabin. We both need to go the bathroom, so we head to the bathhouse. However, the doors are closed and locked shut. By this time, the bar is closed and the KOA owners apparently do not live on site like most other KOAs. We're tired, we've been flying all day, and we've already pre-paid... so we decided to make the best of it and stay anyway. We should have left and found a hotel. The next morning, I awake to bites all over my arms and neck. A couple of days later, my wife notices now she has bites all over her arms, legs, and neck. We verify with our doctor that we have indeed been bit by bed bugs. By this time, we have already gone home and taken all the clothes and linens into our house as well. Now, we fear that we have brought these bed bugs into our own home!!! We have contacted the owners since arriving home, but have not received a response. We will never, ever considering staying at this KOA again!!!"
2.5,1,"Propane refills are a set price no matter how little you need. Basically you are paying 2-3 times what you get elsewhere. $2.46 at most places, but almost $5 a gallon here. Rude kid  behind the counter too when asked why it was so high. ""Been that way for ten years"".......so they've been ripping people off for ten years?
Won't be back and I live right near them."
2.5,2,"I have to agree with Glen R.  It is almost like the campground is an afterthought to the Blimpie / Gas Station / RV Check in place.  The pool in the campground was ""ok,"" and I would have to agree that the pizza place attached to the Blimpies is kind of a local hang out.  The spot we stayed in was quite long, and very level.  We had PLENTY of room to get our 45' bus and 26' trailer into the spot, and stay attached for the night.  The campground has a ""run down"" feel to it, and a sense of ""permanency"" as most of the guests there are probably long term residents.  With that said, if you need a place to pull off the road and get some good rest in a decent spot, this would be your place.  There are a few restaurants and grocery stores in the immediate vicinity that will make your evening's stay a little more tolerable.  No frills, but not expensive either."
2.5,1,"If you're an RVer, stay away from this place!
Let me start off by saying that this campground was strange from the get go.  If you look them up in the KOA directory you'll see that they boast about on site camp store, Blimpie, gas ,etc.  This is  because the campground is located AT THE GAS STATION.  The camp store isn't a camp store...it's a gas station convenience store with a Blimpie in it.  And worse than that, connected to the convenience store is a neighborhood dive bar.
The pull through sites are very long but most have just rocks and no smooth spot at all.
They don't have any fire rings yet sell firewood at the store.  We asked about making a fire and the gas attendant, uh Blimpie worker, uh convenience store worker, uh campground worker told us to just make it on the ground...IN THE GRASS! (The rocky pull through site was so bad that we asked to be moved to a grassy back in one)
Here's the worst part...the dive bar gets crowds at night and they allow them to park up into the campground.  Supposedly they have security in the front but we drove right past them coming back one night.  One afternoon, I went into my cooler to find out that beer and wine were stolen from it...no doubt from the drunks leaving the bar.  This was a first for me.  It forced us to clean up everything we had outside, put it away and lock all of our storage compartments. 
This campground appears to be a 1 night stay over place on your way to somewhere else.  I suppose it's ok for that, just don't leave anything outside and make sure you get a site WAY in the back so you don't hear the motorcycles and cars starting at 2am when everyone leaves the bar.  It is NOT a family campground and I wish I knew that ahead of time.
Never again!"
2.5,4,It was perfect for what we needed.  Very clean and the quiet.  Brought the kids down for a soccer tournament and just needed a place to sleep.  Its offseason so the place was relatively empty.  Kids took advantage of playground and mini golf.  Gas Station check in/out was simple and convenient.  Will use this place again in the future.
2.5,3,"This was the most odd KOA we have stayed at. Other reviewers comments are accurate. It is an open campground with the appearance of security via tall white fencing but it isn't secure at all. Check-in across the street at the Valero gas station was convenient and quick. 

No onsite personnel. 
For the premium KOA charges this should not be a KOA park."
2.5,2,"Unloved, uncared for, and just plain sad.  

Of all the KOAs we've stayed at in 20 months of road tripping, the Fort Mill KOA was the grubbiest of them all. 

Here's the good, bad, and the ugly:
Good access from Interstate 77.
Walking distance to a decent grocery store: Publix
Ungraded and unkempt RV sites.
Sad sparse grass and picnic tables that were unusable. 
Thank goodness we didn't have to use the bathrooms, beyond sketchy! 
Check-in was at a Valero Gas Station. Just a little weird.
No indication of any real on-site presence of KOA personnel.

Gave this KOA 2 stars mainly for the convenience for a family get together in Charlotte, NC. Would only consider staying here again if it was for a short 1 or 2 night stay. Gotta say I don't think anyone would love just hanging out here."
3.5,1,"If you like homeless people, if you like police helicopters, if you like dog poo, if you like watching drug deals going on at the entrance late at night, if you like chaining everything down to keep from being stolen, if you like loud stereos (cars), being woke up by loud motor cycles, there are 2 apartment buildings close to the park most trouble comes from the low income apartments. people are free to come and go as they please(homeless) the owners and management could care less! most pet owners are responsible and pic up after there pet right then. And others are irresponsible let there dogs doo every where and leave it for the flies. make sure you bring plenty of locks with you! you will need them. your better off spending the extra money and stay at a secured rv park!"
3.5,5,Let me start by saying that i'm new to the RV lifestyle. With that said my gal and I moved down here to pheniox looking go start fresh and a new adventure. We had made plans to stay at another park but that feel through. So we where given angye' s number and gave her a call. She was very polite and helpful with all the questions we had. She keeps the place up and clean and she is always trying to make improvements. The spaces are a good size and the water and sewer all work good. The pool is blue and the water clean and inviting. She has newly remodeled restrooms and showers and they are clean and fresh. The park also offers laundry room and pop and candy machines. The place is very relaxing and just fun to be here. Where here on a long stay but the overnight and short short stay u won't be disappointed. The park also has fruit trees andvit is  yummy and delicious. So we will leave the camp fire on for u so stop on in and say hey.
3.5,4,"Cozy little RV Park. Saw lots of not so great reviews and was concerned but my family had an okay experience here. I think maybe some people just have higher expectations than others? I mean its not the ritz, its an RV park....Anyone renting a space is usually there for the experience more than anything...I would come here again."
3.5,3,"Convenient location and EZ access to Black Mountain Freeway offset the startling lack of amenities and indifferent staffing.

A hostile check-in process starts things off: If you're lucky, the owner (of the horsey set who lives in the foothills an hour north) will be in the office; if not, you'll have to get lucky dialing one of the several phone numbers posted near the door.  DO NOT (even with a confirmed reservation) randomly choose any of the many available sites and plan to check in in the morning,  You will be asked to relocate when staff (belatedly) arrives on scene.

There is a small pool (unheated), adjacent to the bathhouse, a depression-era affair best used only for the laundry machines.  The good news is lots of grass. There are shady sites under the large trees or wide-open sites for the satellite dish crowd.  There is electric, sewer, and water, but no phone or cable.  In spite of the soundwall, there is some road noise, plus police helicopters frequent the skies above.  The immediate neighborhood is dumpy and sketchy-looking but without any real crime problem.  About 1/3 of the sites are occupied by permanent residents.

We have stayed here several times and will again when we travel to Phoenix."
3.5,5,"Great park!  Angy the manager was the most helpful and kind in our time of need...Above and beyond. Wonderful sites, trees, clean accessible showers and restrooms. Easy access to highways and shopping.  We are going to stay here every chance we get to be in Arizona!  Really nice people parked all around us. Don't miss this spot."
3.5,3,"The parking spaces are flat requiring no leveling   Mature shade trees and lots of grassy areas   Most of the sites are occupied by permanent residents.    A good spot for the overnighter needing a convenient spot


If you want to use the restrooms and showers, although you probably wouldn't want to, there is a $3 per person per day additional charge.  

The neighborhood is dicey at best.  Not a place for an evening stroll."
3.5,5,"We went to Phoenix for 2 college graduations from Grand Canyon University.   We had 7 people and a gagle of dogs.  Angie was amazing, and we found the park to be very nice and quiet (except for our dogs, which we are very sorry for).  The grandchildren found the pool to be a lot of fun.  The people in the park were very friendly.  It was close to shopping and the University.  
   There weren't any ""trails"", but never expected any.  We were told to watch our things at night, which we did and never had a problem.
    This was a great park for our trip and would suggest it to anybody who wants to stay in Phoenix.  
     Thank you, Angie!"
3.5,1,"We would give lower rating but can't. First the park is in a risky neighborhood. We did not know it but we woke up in the moring to police and police helicopter going around and around over the rv park. The police kept saying ""Do not try to run, you are surrounded, put your hands up."" Now this was at 6 am in the morning on a Sunday! Another thing is that there is a population of people that live in their campers there and do not follow the rules for ALL animals to be on a leash. I have two small dachshunds and a cat was under our camper that we did not know about. It was another campers pet. My dogs do not like cats and my dogs were on leases but when my little one saw the cat....he went after it. The other camper on the other side of us also had a cat off leash. She proceeded to yell at me about my dogs. My husband took our dogs out to potty at 9pm to see a woman with two medium size dogs that were off leash. My dog was on lease and by my camper she was waking around with a flashlight when HER dogs went after my dog which my husband had to pick up to save him from being attacked. This woman works part time at the park and DOES NOT FOLLOW THE RULES. I hated this place the minute I saw it and it is run down, not a good RV place."
3.5,5,Everything about working with All Pro has been great.  The customer service is second to none and the quality of their work is perfect.  When you think about taking a vehicle in to a shop for work you always get a little nervous.  You don't have to here.  They are GREAT!
4,4,"We have been members of the Lake for at least six years.  We have camped for the last two seasons!  We had never heard of the Lake, or Loyal Oak as it was previously called until a friend invited us out for the day.  I had no idea that a place like this existed near us.  It's hidden down a country road and is the most relaxing way to spend a summer afternoon.  No, it's not a pool.  No, it's not a hipster place.  It's nostalgic!  It's reminiscent of simpler summer days.  People will come back and comment that it looks just like it did when they were kids...and that's not a bad thing.  :)  It seems like we, as parents, are so wrapped up in making everything comfy and the best for our kids that we forget to just let them be kids!  This is the place that lets them be kids!  They can run and play forever!  They can swing and climb and go to the batting cage.  They can play putt-putt golf and ride bikes!  Then, they can cool off by jumping in a lake that now has inflatables!  There is a concession stand that is reasonably priced and has been a highlight of our daughter's lake visits...we always have to have our snack money in the bag!  

It's been under new ownership for the last two years and that is making ALL the difference in the world!  Previously, the campground was run-down and in disrepair.  The new owners have worked and worked to continually bring up the camping standard.   It is a night and day difference in the appearance of the campground...and it's still happening!  Every year improvements are made.  This year many new campers are coming in and energy is building!

When we looked at spots for our camper, we didn't even own a camper!  We just knew from talking with the new owners that this place was going to turn around and we didn't want to miss out on having a great spot for the future!  So, we got our spot and later found a camper. So very glad that we did this!  It's a great place for our family to relax and make new friends!"
4,5,Brought the kids here for a day as a guest. What a great time we all had! The kids are still swimming - on and off inflatables- slides and docks!  Short rest breaks for snacks - thanks for a great family day!  Beautifully kept grounds - fun life guards and engaging owner.
4,4,"I understand all the previous reviews.  However, change doesn't happen overnight.  The new owner has come in with rules.  These rules are to clean up the campground and ensure a safe, clean, family environment....something many families look for when choosing a campground.  There were many things that needed to be done to the campground clean-up wise and repair-wise.  These are being done. It was a very rainy spring and obviously that slows things down a bit.  The rules are stricter than before, and the price is higher than before.  Both of those can be expected with a change in ownership and plans of improvement.  

As the campground was in past years....we would have never, ever camped there.  We took a chance and got a site this year.  Every week it improves.  We will be return campers....because of the change in ownership, the improvements, and the rules.  :)

The campground also has weekly activities that are family oriented.  They even have a movie night on the lake, which is a great idea.  

I am anxious to see what the next few years hold for the Lake."
4,4,"We stayed at this park for 3+ months this winter. This park is a traditional 55+ community where 80% of the spaces are occupied by park models, which are a version of a mobile home. The other spaces are used for the RVs. The spots are on the small side. Our 43' RV barely fits. The amenities of the park are the selling point. They have a great activities center that has 2 pools, 2 hot tubs, an outdoor cantina and grill along with pool room, sewing room, library, etc.  They have more activities going than you have time in the day. If you are bored at this park, you didn't try. 

Just don't expect to use the wifi as it is unusable.  

We will definitely stay at this park again because of the friends we made that live there. 

See our full review at www.thegilliamsisland.com."
2,1,"Omg what a rat hole!!! The staff ranges from indifferent to flat out rude, dumpster diving vagrants, no wifi except in the office and wall to wall hookers & junkies!!! But at least you do get to be way too far from the strip and every thing else you came here for. It's a 20 minute drive to the closest store or restaurant  that feels safe. Imagine the neighborhood where Clark & Ellen got lost in the original Vacation and you start to understand. It's a bad plan to stay here !! Even at $18 a day it's a waist of money"
2,5,"Very friendly staff! Close to freeway 95, downtown and the strip. Night security and the facilities are well maintained and super clean. Every other park wants you to be 55 and older to stay extended time. 

I read some of the reviews for this place and apparently those people had issues that I have not experienced here. 

It's on Boulder hwy true but once your inside and away from the road it does not seem like it's in a crappy area. No traffic noises where I am at!"
2,1,"Danger!  Beware of this place!  I was there for a week. Looks nice but looks can be deceiving. 

Had my wallet stolen. Had my wife and children threatened. Pedafile constantly driving by and watching my kids. Staff is rude and will overcharge you for electricity.

Why stay here when there are so many other places? Even just down the street there are better places for the same price (you wont be saving anything when the electric bill comes). 

Look I am writing to warn you. If you don't listen. Then I told you so in advance. I am not the type to complain (this is my first negative review ever). I am just concerned about what might happen to your children or wife if you stay here.

If you just got out of prison for child molestation, like prostitutes and drink all day. Well, enjoy because this is the park for you."
2,1,"I have to say it! The manager and the neighbour laughed at us! Talk about us at our windows together! For hours! The administrator would even give my mother and me handcuffs! Very shocked! Just come back, the dog has been calling! Mom can't sleep. Please stay here carefully."
2,1,To bad the management got sick and the office gal that took over can't handle the park! Place in 3 months has fallen apart ! Wasp by the pool bees every where and really bad ants !!! Place has gone to hell in a hand basket!
2,1,"I never give a review on anything or any where but I will this ....Where do I even begin about this RV park if I could I would not even give it a star rating !!! First let's start off by saying the Rv staff Is beyond rude to the point of flat out ignorant  The location is terrible high crime and drug related area please note you are in north Las Vegas many many episodes of ""Cops"" have been Filmed there The RV park claims to have security but never seen one you have to hive  a $10 deposit for the shower house and if you miss place the key you wound be aloud a new one also the shower house and laundry area's reeked of marijuana on the website it states that it has Wi-Fi which it doesn't they have one hotspot in the office and the office is closed more then it's open  there is wild feral  cats the run the park are spot was located near the dumpster area which prostitutes  frequently used to conduct business we caught the homeless people digging in the trash at all hours of the night if your coming to the Las Vegas area and wanting to stay at this RV park with your kids it's not  kid friendly at all  And did I happen to mention the camp is filthy One of the management staff named ""Cookie"" told me that my children was not allowed to ride their bikes I could go on and on about this Rv park but I'm just going to simply say DO NOT  waste your time and money on this RV park your miles from the strip and all sites and scenery !!"
4,2,"We rented a 29 foot, Ford-powered, Class C Winnebago RV from Phoenix Motorhomes, LLC (PMH) to go on an 18-day, 3300 mile, seven state trip originating in Phoenix, then up to Rapid City, SD and back.  There were seven of us:  my wife, our daughter and her four kids, ages 8 up to 14.  We were first-time RV operators.  We spent a considerable amount of time checking out the local RV dealers and settled on PMH for a variety of reasons, including price, availability, size and apparent condition of the vehicle.  We were thoroughly briefed about the vehicle by the company prior to taking possession, and we were told the vehicle was in excellent condition despite having in excess of 100K miles on it.  We noted the vehicle was pretty clean, and that there were only a few non-working items.  On the first day of travel, we noted the passenger side mirror - a critical large RV device - would not stay in place, nor would it respond to its electrical control.  That evening, we discovered another critical device inoperative:  no battery in the smoke detector, thus rendering it ineffective.  We replaced the battery.  On the third day of travel, we got our first ""check engine"" caution light, causing a significant amount of stress and a visit to a local Ford dealer.  Calls back to PMH revealed this was a common occurrence, and that we should not be concerned.  On day five, we experienced a shredded, rear, inboard dually tire, necessitating a lengthy wait, a long/expensive repair and a significant delay/alteration in our planned trip.  There was virtually no help offered from PMH.  On day eight, we discovered a radiator leak, necessitating coolant servicing with a ""stop-leak"" product and a constant watch on the coolant level.  Again, there was no help offered by PMH.  There were no more mechanical discrepancies until we reached the outskirts of Phoenix in a large rainstorm, and the passenger side windshield wiper fell off.   Once home, we serviced and cleaned the vehicle in accordance with our contract, and discovered many areas in the vehicle which had not been cleaned in a long time, if ever.  We returned the vehicle in far better shape than when we received it, and provided a comprehensive list of vehicle discrepancies as a gesture of goodwill to the company.  Needless to say, we were not impressed by the quality/condition of our vehicle.  The various mechanical failures and defects we experienced introduced considerable stress into our vacation, additional expense, and caused us to lose approximately a day and a half of our vacation time.  We paid approximately $4050 for the rental, plus consumables and excess miles.  We requested reimbursement for our repair expenses (tire, tire repair, radiator fluids), and after a lengthy amount of silence and foot-dragging, we were repaid for those expenses.  We asked for some consideration for our increased stress and loss of vacation time caused by what we considered to be the faulty equipment and poor service we were given.  After repeated appeals by phone and email directly to the owners, Ludwig and Jacqueline Langenbach, not only were there no additional reimbursement/considerations offered, there were zero responses, a large disappointment, and a show of owner disinterest/disrespect.  This company's principal business appears to be renting RVs to German nationals coming to the U.S. for sightseeing tours headed north.  Customer service and consideration for other, independent renters like us is lacking and indifferent.  Use caution when renting from this company!"
4,5,"This was our first time renting an RV. We were very happy with Phoenix Motorhomes. We booked through a third party site, but direct communications toPhoenix Motorhomes from the time of booking to the pick-up were responded to in a timely fashion. We were picked up at the airport (which we paid a reasonable extra fee for), and when we arrived earlier than expected Daniel was able to accommodate us by picking us up early. The RV we had rented (one of their less expensive, older models) was out for repair, so we were upgraded to a newer, larger RV, and it was beautiful. It was clean and had the basic supplies like linens, dishes, etc. A lot of the companies we had looked into charge extra for these items, but this company does not, at least for the first 2 people. Daniel explained everything well regarding how the RV worked, the process was efficient, and we felt pretty prepared driving away.

We experienced no problems with the RV while on the road, everything worked fine. Return was quick and easy. We weren't nickel and dimed on things when we returned the RV. We left it clean, but you still worry that places will try really hard to find a ding or a messy spot just so they can charge extra. We didn't experience that at all. We were charged only for the mileage that we went over, but the 100 miles a day included in the initial price is generous to begin with, and we were expecting the extra charge.

Overall we thought it was a great experience, and expect to return for more road trips in Arizona and will definitely rent from them again."
5,5,"No matter how far you gotta go the trip is well worth it for your service needs. You're met with honesty, integrity, and just good ol' common sense. The service manager Brian is someone who is very realistic with what he can offer you, and doesn't make false claims or false promises. And the actual service tech Jonathan did an amazing job with a situation that was absolutely beyond belief. Go to Airstream of Scottsdale, you will be very pleased with the service you receive!!"

Update 8/23/18: Came back to have some subsequent warranty work done, and once again we were once greeted with courtesy and professionalism by Brian Ogurschak, the situation which required attention from John from Virginia was handled in a very timely manner as you know time is money. If you've ever  dealt with a Dometic situation you know what I'm talking about, but they handled it in stride and fortunately for us everything seems to be just fine all of it covered by warranty. We will update this review when we are done dealing with Airstream Ohio factory."
5,5,"I have to say I was really nervous about taking the plunge and buying an Airstream, but these folks made it such an easy process. Taylor and Lynn and Ken and Bill and the whole crew have provided some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. I will recommend them to anyone thinking about buying an Airstream.

Thank you all so very much. I cannot wait to go camping!!"
5,5,"Brian, Jay and Tim were exceptional in assisting me on a fabric snap fix. They took a few minutes and came up with an excellent solution. Great people making things easy, I will be doing more business with Airstream of Scottsdale."
5,5,"Largest inventory of Airstreams in the area. Don't
 worry about the heat, this is an indoor showroom. The sales consultants are Airstream knowledgeable, friendly and fun to work with!"
5,5,"we had the most amazing experience buying our brand new Airstream from Airstream of Scottsdale. Our experience first started over the phone and from that first phone call we decided that we would much prefer to drive all the way from Los Angeles to buy our Airstream from Airstream of Scottsdale. Brian Knox, our salesperson, was professional and not pushy. We liked that.  From the time our Airstream was ordered until pick up, the process was smooth and easy.  The finance people (Bill Fain), service people,  sales people, etc were all fabulous. The walk through of our trailer was thorough and helpful... It was well worth the 14+ hour round-trip drive and we would do it again! I cannot be happier with the experience and would recommend them (and the folks at Desert Autoplex of Mesa - which is where we first started before Airstream of Scottsdale was opened ;)) without a question.  THANK YOU EVERYONE."
5,5,I was actually driving by and I am in the market for an airstream.    There are no dealers close to me in the Midwest so while driving by on vacation I finally had my chance to check them out in person.    I let the sales consultant I was from out of town.  He was still happy to give me a quick tour of all the models I had interest in.   Truly amazing trailers.    I will be buying one in the near future.
5,5,"This place is brand new! We attended the Grand Opening party last evening and wow what a showroom! This is an Airstream RV only dealer and all enclosed and air conditioned. They will begin Airstream service in about a month. If you're looking for an airstream , you have to start here.. This is a step up for Desert Autopiler and a fine start to the New Year. Best of luck to them in every way.."
5,5,"Really great people, experience and all. Traded in a 2011 for a new one and hard to believe that I am saying this about a dealership but they were great. I highly recommend them if you are thinking of an Airstream."
4,1,Horrible.. he canceled our reservation 2 weeks before our trip because he couldn't be there to go through the trailer. Then we see someone else has booked the trailer for the same pickup date but rented it longer. Guess more money than your spending gets your reservation cancelled. Out trip is ruined. Cant find a trailer now. Beware
4,5,"Jared is the best in the business, excellent at what he does,provides a 5 star experience."
4,5,Jared was great to deal with from the start. He had great communication. We were excited that he dropped it off the night before so we could get packed and head out first thing. When he got to our house he went over everything although we had recently owned our own some things were different.  The RV was in great condition and it was perfect for our trip. Propane and water were full so we didn't have to worry about that. Thanks Jared we look forward to renting from you in the future.
4,5,"Jared was easy to work with and accommodating for pick up and drop off.  The trailer was clean and in very good shape.  Jared was also very helpful in letting me know all the features of the trailer. I would recommend Hitch-N-Go, and will be using them again in the future."
2.5,4,"Nice place, nice people! Call in advance if you plan to stay a while. We stayed for three months in a motorhome and had to shuffle around a bit. The marina is cool, but very pricey. If you stay in temporary- which is just the spots with no sewer, beware the fanged worm!! At least twice that we are aware, there was a rattlesnake under our rig. It made the cutest inviting rattle noise that said, ""come play with me..."" So I picked them up and put them at the edge of the lot. I used tongs and my ninja like reflexes to catch the fanged worm of course."
2.5,1,"I tried to give this no stars but it won't let me..worst experience of my life, don't stay here, drive further if necessary, manager Rebecca Brink is rude she wanted to charge us 45 dollars for cancelling the 3rd day, numerous people actually living there, very trashy, junk all over there spaces.  REBECCA BRINK RUDE, CONDESCENDING, LIAR, NO LAKE VIEW...website does not tell the truth. 
DON'T STAY HERE TRUST ME ON THIS ONE..from other reviews sounds like Rebecca is the problem.  We actually left and found a great place worth the additional hour drive...Eagle View RV resort.."
2.5,1,"This place is awful. It's RV hell. The place is run like an overzealous HOA, with ridiculous rules that are selectively applied.

It's not great for tent camping. We called ahead to ask about staying in a tent and were told that tent camping was available. We expected there would be wooded areas for tents, but instead we were on gravel with RVs very close to us. We could not stake the tent because the ground was so hard.

On our third day, the female manager came out and told us there had been three noise complaints. She also yelled at us for having a table and chairs outside of our tent, even though the RV'rs had carpets and tables outside. 

Also, there was a terrible storm the night before (unexpected, unusual crazy BAD weather for AZ) and we tied tarps to our tent. Apparently they were too noisy because of the wind. We obviously don't control the weather, and it was pretty shocking that other guests would be so nasty about it. 

After the manager's visit, the resort's security patrol drove by our tent twice per hour for the next several days. It was pretty creepy and bordered on harassment. The manager had threatened to make us leave and it was pretty clear they were looking for a reason to kick us out.

There is a clique at this place, made up of people who live there in their RVs. You will probably not fit in. 

You are not allowed to use the grass. It's a rule.

There are a lot of fees: $10 for a card to use  the showers/pool, and a pet deposit are two examples. The electricity does not work very well, either. There are no toilets nearby, so bring a camp toilet if you are in a tent or stay elsewhere.

This place is expensive and given how nasty the management and staff are, I am surprised they remain in business. Even if I get an RV in the future, I won't be staying here."
2.5,4,"Arrived late last night and was greeted by Rick from security. He could not have been any nicer!!!  So accommodating !  Made sure we knew where to go, even directed us to our spot!  Amazing!!  
I wish everyone was as nice and professional and most of all helpful as Rick. 
Can't wait to come back!!!!"

For the attention of the CEO / General Manager
Dear Mr. Vortherms:

I wanted to take a moment to inform you of an experience that my family had at your property last weekend.  I've included as much detail as possible to hopefully enforce that I am not some rambling idiot, and that the way we were treated was not warranted at all.  Please do me the courtesy of reading and responding to this email.  

On March 11th 2016 my family (consisting of my wife, my 2 daughters [4 & 5] and myself) decided to dry camp at Pleasant Harbor RV Resort.  We arrived around 5:35 that night after we had both finished up work and had time to pack up our travel trailer. When we arrived, the office had already closed so, we paid our $24 at the gate with our credit card, then met the security guard on duty in front of the closed office to get guidance on where to setup.  At that time, I provided the security officer with a great deal of information about who I was (e.g... name, cell phone, address, make of my vehicle and trailer, model of my vehicle and my trailer and the license plate number for both) in addition to showing him the receipt that I had just attained at the front gate as proof I had paid my entrance fee.  After a quick setup of our trailer, my wife and I made dinner and sat in front of our trailer while we let our girls play until around 8PM, then went inside to watch movies.  

The next day my wife and I slept in till about 8:30 and got up to make breakfast in our camper.  Around 9:15 our daughters decided that they wanted to go outside and play, and since it was a great day we thought that would be a fun family oriented thing to do.  As it turns out, we couldn't have been more wrong.  My daughters (again, 4 and 5 years of age) each have Power Wheels Jeeps like a lot of children do.  If you're not familiar with what a Power Wheels Jeep is, look them up on Google.  

  
The Jeeps themselves are about 2.5"" off the ground, are battery powered, and travel at about 4 MPH when their foot is on the floor.  Given that we were in a huge dirt lot, well behind the white plastic barbs which are drilled into the dirt to mark the ""legal"" dry camping area, we decided that there was very little to no inherent risk in letting the girls drive their Jeeps in circles in front of our trailer while we sat literally 3 feet away in our camping chairs.  To put this in perspective, we were conservatively 20 yards away from where the cars drive by the grass area to get to the hook-up spots and about 75 yards from the paved road surrounding the camping area and have done this very same thing dozens of times over the past years.

At around 10:15 the security guard came by on his rounds and chatted with my wife in regards to our camping plans.  He wanted to know what day we were planning on leaving; because, he explained, a fishing tournament was scheduled to happen that Monday the 13th and he was concerned that our camp might be in the middle of where they were planning to have the event or have people park.  We explained that we planned to leave on Sunday morning early which he said was fine and then promptly left.  At this time the security guard (a white haired gentleman) was in the truck alone and must have passed by us three or four times between 10:15 and 12:00 or so.  The whole time my children were in their Jeeps driving around in front of our camper and he said nothing.  We have a rule that if they see a driving car that they stop their Jeeps and watch the car pass before they are allowed to drive again, and they abided by this rule as cars (including security) passed by all day.

Unfortunately for us, at some point your park manager, Rebecca Brink, decided to join the security guard on one of his patrols.  The scene at our camper had not changed at all, my wife and I were sitting in front of our camper talking while our children drove their Jeeps 20 yards from us on the large patch of roped off grass in the middle of the park (the one that no campers are allowed to park around).  Mrs. Brink and the security guard felt compelled, for some reason, to stop and reprimand my wife for letting the girls drive the Jeeps on the grass.  Again, to put this in perspective; there were families with coolers, families playing baseball and even two guys in lawn chairs in the grass with my daughters and we were less than 20 yards away.  Mrs. Brink advised my wife that the children were not allowed to drive the toy Jeeps on the grass, which my wife agreed to immediately.  Mrs. Brink then went on to inform my wife that she is ""sick of wasting her whole day telling people how to parent their children"" and that ""the grass is not to be used, that it is simply there to look at"".  Ultimately, my wife simply took what Mrs. Brink was saying with a grain of salt and asked my girls to come back by the trailer instead.    

I think it's very important to understand at this point that my wife and I are both 40+ working business professionals, we were a"
2.5,5,"Great prices, great views, great service, great facilities and great time! I absolutely love this place. We store our coach here as well. Reasonable storage prices with plenty of room to maneuver. Plus they dumping and fuel right on site!

Couldn't bring myself to give one less star for this recommendation: they need to have parking passes at the front gate for the visitors. The set up on passes is inconvenient and a hassle. For campers in lots, check in should be able to call the front gate and create parking passes at the gate for pick up upon arrival. Would also be nice if they would find I service for mobile dumping of black and grey water. They have mobile propane though!"
2.5,2,"My family reserved a temp spot over looking the lake for the weekend --I paid a deposit and then paid an additional $65 for two nights including the pet fee and deposit for the pool key. As our spot did not have sewer we needed to use the dump station before we left. It was difficult to find and when we did it was locked. I called the office and they told me they would send someone to unlock it but it would cost me $8- Really $8 more dollars as a dump fee for each time a person would like to dump? They will waive the fee if you stay 3 or more days but if you stay one or two nights you must pay extra to dump your gray water/waste... The office staff was not friendly either during check in or during check out, not rude really but completely uninterested... The patrol/security were all very nice and in the area quite a bit. This was my first overnight visit and, as we live close, I have been thinking of joining the boating club but after this experience I don't think it would be a good idea- as I began to feel like they were looking for ways to charge additional fees where ever they could. Just set a fair price and include the entire experience."
2.5,1,"So apparently I can not camp in my brand new $40,000 pop up high wall camper!  But driving thru there today they had the most nastiest of travel trailers and motor homes parked in there!  I can't understand why you wouldn't want a brand new Popup over a nasty old RV!!!"
2.5,5,"This is one of our most favorite RV places everything is so clean and kept nice throughout  the park. We had a tree issue with the leaves getting caught up in the awning they sent a very nice man out he took care of it in a matter of minutes sorry I dont remember his name. We needed air in our tires they sent a guy that had an air compressor on his truck from the park. Their shuttle to the marina both times were quick and prompt. We wish we had more time, we will be back. This is a must stay if you haven't stayed yet"

If you live in Boulder city or Henderson or passing through I highly recommend them! Nice to do business with a small local RV shop! They have mine, from now on!"

My fiancé and I rented and RV for 10 days of California cost line fun and they were able to help us for-fill a life long dream and make wonderful memories! 
Their prices beat any other place and they were so helpful ..I was able to reach them at any time for questions or concerns.. I was able to get a wonderful luxury RV better than any RV I have rented in the past .. they showed me everything I needed to know.. I definitely recommend Boulder City RV ... they will definitely be my go to!!!"
4.5,5,I bring all my vehicles Big boy toys. Highly recommend .You'll get your money's worth and more
4.5,5,"We can't say enough good things about the paint job Big Boys Toys did on our 1953/2004 Commemorative Corvette.  The prep work was thorough, the paint color matched perfectly and the clear coats buffed out to a gorgeous shine. The price for the work done was reasonable and both Alfredo and his son were professional and courteous.  We highly recommend them, particularly if you have a classic or custom vehicle that needs a loving touch and special attention.  Our corvette was a big investment and deserves all the love and attention it received from Big Boys Toys.  They really care. And they will come to you!   Kent and Karen Carmichael"
4.5,1,"I have this guy, Alfredo, do a job for me on a pickup truck. At first I overlooked his cockiness because I had heard he was a good body man, but then after completion of the job I was totally disappointed... And he charged way too much. I have never dealt with them or unprofessional asshole with a huge ego in my life. I wouldn't have this guy fix anything on my car not even changing windshield wipers if he was the only guy left on my choices.
   Upon seeing him for years later in passing, I could see that his alcoholism and caught up to him... Not to mention his drug use. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this prick"
4.5,5,"After being a victim of a scam mobile paint repair, the outcome of the ""paint repair"" was worse than the actual paint damage. (Yes I know it's my fault) I searched the net for a legit paint shop to repair the job of the scam painter on my wife's Audi A7. Alfredo is a straight up honest guy. Others would have worked me for more money on something he ended up taking care of for no cost. Alfredo and his boys did a very, very outstanding job! Matched the pearl white perfectly. I tried to find imperfections but I could not find any. He removed the two dings on the rear passenger quarter panel. I will be taking my classic car to him. Alfredo and his boys are number one in my book!!! Highly recommended!!!"
4.5,5,"I am so happy I found Alfredo who is the owner of Big Boys Toys which makes the service even more personable along with his son who works with him.  My daughter was in a fender bender with the car and I didn't feel it was worth the ding I would get on my insurance, I was referred to Alfredo so I called and got an estimate.  Not only did he come to the mechanic to look at the damage but he picked up the car for me after they completed it so I wouldn't have to go out of my way. He quoted me a very fair price and told me not to worry about it. When I finally went back to pick up the car it was back to perfect as if nothing ever happened. Since then I had gone back for something small and Alfredo noticed that something was out of line so he told me to take the car back to the mechanic from the accident because they had not aligned it correctly. I was worried that they wouldn't honor their work and he said that if they gave me a hard time to call him and he would call the shop. It was a really nice dealing with a mechanic that was honest, passionate about his work and you could tell he lives and breaths what he does. I will never go to another bodyshop. I have found my bodyshop for life for all of our family cars with Alfredo and his son. Excellent work, gets the job done in a timely manner, nice all around guy to deal with and as a woman it's nice to know that I'm dealing with an honest mechanic. I highly recommend Alfredo at Big Boys Toys."
4.5,5,Thank you Alfredo for your speedy help today and honestly will  definitely do business with you guys again and refer a friend  or family
3.5,5,Had a complete new roof put on our Dutch Star motorhome 1 1/2 yr ago.  They did a great job in a timely manner.  Super easy to work with.  We are going back for a new awning.  Both jobs well under what RV dealer and Camping World quotes.  Highly recommend.
3.5,5,"These guys treat me like family!  I store my 32 ft. trailer with them and always have them do any repairs or additions.  They are kind to answer all my questions and even take the time to ""show me"" how to properly maintain the camper.  Whether it is an electrical plug-in overnight or checking the tire pressure on my trailer tires before I leave town, they are there for me like brothers.  I am grateful to have them!"
3.5,1,"Don't take your camper to Custom RV Services for any reason. We dropped our camper off in October and finally picked it up May 12- court ordered. Custom RV raised the estimate thousands of dollars without our permission, they never winterized the camper which led to a ruptured hot water heater, and Custom RV held our camper for ransom to the point of having to take them to small claims court. We won our camper back, but they only fixed one side, and now we have problems that we didn't have 7 months ago. This was the worst service we've ever experienced."
2.5,1,"Well, for starters... I have no idea where they got these pictures from!
This park is old, run down and not maintained!
The common facilities are older than some of the residents!
The management is rude and dismisses the residents requests and concerns.
Horribly managed."
2.5,1,"We live in a home in Apollo Village,, We find the staff to be excellent , and very friendly, And try to get this dump up to snuff,  The old nasty unfriendly and extremely clique makes the place awful to live in,, You are invited to join the activities and when you do, no one speaks to you and you end up alone at a table. It is not the staff that is the problem here, it is the old farts old old that live here, The place needs repair and alot of really old homes from the 50 alot of single wides,  I disagree with the last review. If you smoke your brains out and drink your brains out, you will fit right in with the social group ( NOT) that rules here. Same 8 couples over and over, unfriendly as all get out, Want to meet you to gossip but then act like they don't know you if you see them when their friends are around.  Check the other parks out,  the pool is nice and clean the maintenance man is a sweetheart, and so pleasant, the office staff are very very nice and are really trying, but the majority of the group of old nasty old farts don't give them or any new comer a break,, Will be leaving, hate to leave the pool and the office staff but will be on our way."
2.5,5,Don't know what Amanda's problem was but my family has been staying here since the 70's and three generations. The residents and the staff have been nothing but nice. The facilities have been well maintained and there is always activities for the residents. Shopping is close by and several places for sight seeing
5,5,"When selecting a Mobile RV Repair Service company in today's world; it is paramount to choose one with integrity, superior knowledge, utmost professionalism and follow-through from start to finish. Choosing the right RV repair and maintenance company, could very well mean the difference between utmost relief and total nightmare.

We initially found Donnelly Mobile RV Repair by referral from Dometic Corporation, as their warranty go to mobile service company. 

After initially meeting with the owner James Donnelly; we chose to do business him for an A/C warranty repair. It was a strange problem we were having; and he had it resolved in just a few minutes. His passion for his business along with his vast expertise; combined with the careful nature of his work left us knowing we now had someone we could trust for future work. In fact, we felt like we had known him for years; and we praise him for his true kindness and friendship as well.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and we wanted a new A/C with heat pump installed on the rear of our coach. We got a great Black Friday deal online on a new unit; and James came by to install it today with his helper. They did a perfect install job in a reasonable amount of time; and charged us very fairly for their work.

What more could one ask for these days. A professional, who's fair and honest; combined with showing up as promised. In addition, he is a wealth of knowledge when you have lots of questions. I trust his knowledge, suggestions and answers to questions implicitly without question.

It turns out that many of our neighbors in our RV Resort already knew about his excellence; after much conversation with others. We felt like we needed to let everyone know of our experiences as well.

If you have an RV, Travel Trailer, 5th wheel or other similar service need, and want to be treated with fairness, honesty and respect - along with total professionalism; do yourself a favor and call James at Donnelly Mobile RV Repair.You'll be glad you did :) 

By the way, he even keeps you updated by text and/or phone of his arrival (if that's important to you)."
5,5,"From Beginning to end ,had a great experience with James. From quote, to selection and choices to price
installation all went well. Very satisfied with professional service and personable attitude! We are
happy with our new ""Cadallic"" of toilets! James is a 
great find!"
5,5,"James did a wonderful job replacing the heat pump on my 42' 5th wheel under tight time restrictions. We were due to leave in 8 days and James diagnosed, ordered and installed a new Coleman-Mach 8.0 unit within that time frame. On top of that, James worked directly with our ESP and all we had to do was pay the deductible. The new unit works great and we are happy campers once again. Thanks James!"
2.5,1,What a horrible holiday weekend. People were rude and swore like sailors. Pool was nice but I understand the hot tub has not been functioning for over a decade. Great fireworks but when over we were asked to contribute toward them. Music in our area was blaring until nearly 3 am. Was yelled at by old lady as I threw my trash away. Not a warm fuzzing feeling at all.
2.5,1,"Im posting on behalf of my dad, stepmom, and step brother who stayed at Crystal Lake Campground last weekend. What an absolute shame. We grew up coming to the campground and staying in the yurts, so my parents thought it would be fun to take their grandchildren. 

With only a few days before their trip, management informed them that the pool would not be open. My dad called to get a refund for their stay and management declined. My dad asked for a discount, since part of the reservation fees include use of the pool, management declined again. The only things they were willing to do were offer a pontoon boat and a golf cart free of charge for the weekend. Sounds great, right? WRONG.

Once they got to the campground, they were shocked with how debilitated everything was. Everything looked worn and old. This place should have underwent construction a looooooong time ago!! When they got to their cabin, the TV did not work correctly. The cabin offered cable TV, however the guests before them had taken the network access card from the tv. The guests next door did not have this issue, so my dad went to talk with the front desk. All they said was, ""sorry."" Why should they have to pay for something that was not included in their stay? But the front desk was completely unhelpful. The DVD player did not work and the people they claimed to have sent to repair it...NEVER CAME!!!!!

Moving on to the ""pontoon"" boat they offered my family to use. It was some janky, unsafe barge with plastic lawn chairs secured to it!!!!!! There was no way they were going to take their 5 year old granddaughter out on that death trap! What a joke!!! 

After they experienced everything above, they decided to leave an entire day early. They asked the front desk AGAIN for some sort of refund due to the quality (or lack of) their stay. But again, management declined to reimburse them for anything!!!!!!

Here is a place that we used to love coming to as kids....now they will NEVER EVER COME BACK! 

Once you book with Crystal Lake, be prepared to not get your money's worth...."
2.5,4,"Our family had a good time at Crystal Lake. Here's a brief run down:
The advantages:
- It was very affordable. We rented a cabin for $85/night for all of us. What a deal! The Leinies on tap in the bar were just $2 too.
- Everyone was friendly and helpful. We had just come from the Dells where the welcome was a bit cold due to the sheer masses of people.
-The swimming pool is huge and well maintained. They even have a lifeguard on duty.
- The sandy beach also has a lifeguard & has a trampoline and other fun toys to keep kids busy.
- You can rent a pontoon boat and/or golf cart. 
- There are other activities too like mini golf, Skyball, volleyball, playground.

Disadvantages:
- The hot tub was broken & we missed it due to chilly temps.
- Our cabin's (cabin A) deck faced the parking lot so it wasn't very private or nature-y. 
- Cabins A & B are actually in the same building with a thin door separating them. When our neighbors talked in normal voices, we could hear them clearly. This was annoying the night they decided to stay up until 1am. We complained the next day & front desk staff said we should have told them as 11pm is curfew. Cabin C or A-Frame seem to be individual buildings so maybe choose those...
- Overall the cabins, campground, restrooms, etc were  clean however the windows hadn't been cleaned in a long time. I opened one to let in fresh air in our cabin but came across a ton of spiders so quickly closed it back up... 
-A fresh coat of paint would be good. Especially to the cabins' exterior, mini-golf, deck.

All in all, we had a very good few days and would certainly go back, especially given the low budget. My 8 year-old says everything was his favorite :)"
2.5,5,"We just camped here the weekend of 7/16/16.  We saw some bad reviews so we were nervous but that was not our experience at all...we had a great time.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Two good examples: We got there pretty late on Friday night so we were backing in our camper in the dark and the owner came over to see if we needed any help and chatted with us for awhile.  Then as we were leaving Sunday night we stopped for a moment so the kids could run up to the store and get some ice cream and somebody noticed us just sitting on the road and thought we needed help.  They called a staff member that lived near us and she came running up to us from her home (after she was off for the night) to see if we needed help.  I asked her about the bad reviews and she mentioned a new owner took over a year ago and pumped a ton of money into the place and it shows.

So here's what we liked:
   - Site was clean and well maintained.  Fire pit was cleaned out.  We had site 2, which was right next to the dump station so I was a bit worried about that, but they had some nice landscaping around the area so you couldn't see it and there was no smell.  The plus about that site is that it's the closest to the beach.
   - All of the play areas are located in the same spot.  Our site was about a 1 minute walk from those which made it nice when we had to take breaks and we could let the kids run around.
   - Friendly staff.
   - They had some activities on Saturday like digging for gold on the beach, train and wagon rides, ice cream social, color contests, etc.
   - They had pontoon boats, jet skis, pier slips, fishing boats, canoes, and golf carts to rent.
   - Very nice beach with a sectioned off area of the lake for swimming.  Tons of fun floating rafts, trampoline, slides, and other climbing stuff anchored to play on.  Lake was clean with no algae problems.  There was a life guard on duty on Saturday.
   - They had a separate area of the beach fenced off for pets to play in, although I didn't see any pets while we were there.
   - Very nice pool with a separate kiddie pool.  Life guards in there too.
   - Jumping pillow, beach volley ball court, and trampoline basketball game thing that was fun.
   - They have a DJ on Friday and Saturday nights.  Music was good and the kids had fun dancing.
   - Full bar there if that's your thing.
   - Good camp store with a little arcade in there.  They also have soft serve and scoop ice cream.  Looked like it was just recently built.
   - The only thing not included in the camping price were the rentals.  All other activities were free to guests.

The Cons (potentially):
   - The sites are pretty close together but honestly that's what you get in places like this.  You don't come to these places for large wooded sites...you're here for the fun stuff.  If you're spending a ton of time in the campsite at a place like this then you're doing it wrong.  :)
   - The only thing I could see people having a problem with is the DJ music is loud and goes until midnight.  We actually didn't mind it...we sat outside by our fire and listened to the music after the kids went to bed.  But if your kids are light sleepers it might be hard for them to go to sleep.  We closed our windows and turned on the fan and the white noise drowned out 95% of the music (plus they were exhausted so they crashed).  The owner warned us on Friday when we chatted that they were loud until midnight, but said they are good about quieting down right at midnight.  Sure enough the DJ announced that it was quiet hours right at midnight and told everybody they had to go inside (music was on the outdoor porch) or back to their sites and please respect the campers. By 12:10 the noise was pretty much gone.

We'll be heading back in a couple weeks with some family friends and looking forward to it."
2.5,1,"Great people camp there. Activities are canceled sometimes without notice, bathrooms and showers are horrible, bar drinks are high in a small glass, and do not drink the water on the campsites which is milky white. The owner does not appreciate any educated woman asking him questions. My husband can ask questions rudely and he is fine with that but as a woman speaking to the owner in a normal voice without being rude he tells you he has no time for you. I do not recommend this campground. We have camped for 30+ yrs and this is in the top 5 worse campgrounds."
2.5,4,"Been going here for years. There has been a recent change in management and they seem to be taking better care of the campground than in past years. The lake now allows powerboats and jetskiis again, which is a big plus. The pool was really nice the last few times we went, clean and attentive lifeguards. And the beach has a bunch of fun toys for the kids (ahem, and adults) to play on (did someone say water trampoline!). This is not the kind of campground where you can expect to have a very secluded and quiet weekend, since campsites are next to each other. But it is definitely the kind of place to take friends and families with kids, since there's a lot of kid-friendly activities going on during the day, as well as parties/concerts at the bar at night for adults. I will definitely be coming back this year."
3,5,"Very nice, well maintained, and secure facility.  Friendly, helpful office staff and convenient email billing.  I moved my camper here several months ago from another facility that I wasn't comfortable with and have been very happy with Firebird."
3,1,I would not recommend this storage at all. It is poorly maintained and not customer friendly. When I removed my RV after my first month the user of the site next to mine completely encroached into my space making it very difficult to back out. I was forced to pay a full months lease regardless of the verbal acknowledgment that I only needed the space for one month at the time of the initial signing of the contract. Contrary to the verbiage of the contract I was told it would not be a problem as long as I moved before the first.   Obviously it was a problem and I paid it.   Very unhappy
3,1,"I agree with the other 1 star rating only because of the customer service. Nasty is the perfect word. The facility meets our needs, so it is unfortunate. We try to limit any contact with individuals there. We are In/Out through the gate and Pay Online!"
3,1,"Called to inquire about renting a space for my new motorhome. Wow! Talk about rude. The lady that identified herself as the manager could not have been more nasty. Apparently this individual has some personality issues. My buddy had the exact same experience but in person when looking for a place to store his boat.

Found a better location with reasonable people to deal with and more amenities. If you want to give your money to a place that could care less about how they treat their potential customers, this is the place for you. Life is too short to deal with nasty people."
4.5,5,"Warning, this may be lengthy - it's just how I roll.  We have friends that have campers and we have discussed purchasing our own for about 7-10 years.  We have heard a lot about the various brands and dealerships and I am obsessive about researching our purchases and planning.  We were finally going to take the plunge and sell our first born son and buy a travel trailer!  WOOT!  We already upgraded in our thought process from a pop-up to hybrid trailer and at the last minute planted firmly on a fifth wheel.  Ok, not at last minute, but rather after researching we found they were safer and easier to maneuver. I scoured travel trailer forums, reviews, etc. and we zero'd in on 3 units, 2 by Keystone and 1 by Grand Design.  I found the units located at 3 different dealerships and visited 2 and called the last one since they were 1.5 hour drive.  

Paul Evert's RV Country in Mesa was our first stop and Chris Bertrone, the sales guy tooled us around to look at the unit on my list and a few others.  I actually fell in love with a unit they had on sale but it was 4' over the ""max"" length my hubby was willing to pull.  Chris answered all of our questions & was very patient with us.  One test my husband does is to see how they respond to me & my questioning.  Typically they just try talking to him & he soft pitches them to me.  Chris quickly picked up on that after the 1st pitch & took his clues from me after that.  

I explained we were just starting our hunt & had others to look at and probably would not be purchasing until end of year where we would pay cash.  He tried a couple of incentives but was not overly pushy which we appreciated.  He also asked what other units and advised that their store in Flagstaff had the Grand Design unit we were going to look at.  He indicated they would work with us for any units at any of their locations.

We visited Little Dealer in Mesa and looked at few Grand Design models and spoke with the sales guy.  He advised us of their lifetime warranty they include - the prices of the units themselves was the same as at Paul Evert's and also at Orangewood (dealer we called).

We decided we would go ahead and purchase now and pay it off in a few months, so I started negotiations with all 3 dealers.  At this point it was about price & service (customer service & 'service' department).  

In the end, Chris and Paul Evert's came in with the best deal.  I also liked that Paul Evert's service manager has been with them for years.  I researched the dealerships and Paul Evert's had the best reviews as well overall.  

Now, the true test was to see how the end result after negotiations ended.  We filled out financing application but I also applied with our credit union.  The deal with our CU was great, they are local and so we decided to go with them.  However, it can be a bit more difficult since it was a new unit.  So there were phone calls between the CU, me and the dealership to get all of the paperwork the CU required.  The final straw that almost broke the camel's back was getting the..I cannot recall what they call it - but the certificate of ownership which is what the manufacturer provides to get it titled.  So it is the 'title' and needless to say they were not wanting to send it to the CU for closing.  I spoke with Ryan in financing at Paul Evert's and since he had to be at the CU branch for closing asked him to have his corporate office send the document to him and he can bring to the branch at closing at which time he gets the cashier's check.  He was able to get the corporate office to agree!  

We included in the deal an autoslide hitch & installation.  The unit we purchased has a pinbox kingpin so it did not need the autoslide.  They opted to put in a different hitch.  This is the only complaint that I had throughout the whole process....they did not call to explain about the change prior to us picking up our vehicle.  But in the end it was a good hitch and works great.  Also, it was $900 cheaper and they made good and gave us the refund even without all of this being in writing.  I was nervous about that and waited to write my review until everything was completed as they verbally stated.

Chris was phenomenal!  He was quick to respond and even if he did not have the answer he let me know he was working on it.  I am in the Customer Service business in banking, and I value good service.  I feel Chris and his manager provided excellent service!  And the integrity with them following through on everything they stated throughout the process was priceless for us.

We have had our unit for a month now and LOVE it!  We could not be happier with our choice of dealership and camper!

Thanks Chris!"
4.5,5,"One year ago, we purchased a Keystone Montana from Paul Evert's in Mesa, AZ. After a 10-week trip with our new RV, we returned home with a few issues (I.e. minor electrical problems and a tear in the roof membrane). The tear in the roof membrane was caused by being cut short at the manufacturer level. After repeated denials to get the repair of the roof membrane covered under warranty, Neldin Greco, Service Manager at Paul Evert's, stepped in and was able to get the repairs approved under warranty.  Neldin kept us informed of the work and timing of completion, leaving us with no surprises. When our RV was completed and returned to us, the RV had been cleaned inside and out, looking as good as when we bought it. This was something that was not expected. We can't thank Neldin Greco, Brian Holloway and their crew enough for their professionalism, knowledge and patience considering we were new to RVing. We highly recommend Paul Evert's RV Country in Mesa, AZ when looking for a Keystone Montana.
Thanks, Brad & Sharon Johnson"
4.5,1,I love the RV I purchased at Paul Evert's but the experience was painful. The salesman was rude. The staff made me feel pressured I had to purchase the RV that second. I received attitude from them when I told them I needed some time to think and look at other dealerships. When we set up a date to pick up our RV they didn't even have us on the schedule. I was given the RV I picked but it was missing a TV that was promised. I had to argue with the manager to eventually get what I was promised. I purchased warranty for my RV and I have been contacting the dealership for over a month for the information even just the name of the warranty company and I haven't even received a callback. There are many dealerships in Arizona especially in Mesa. Paul Evert's should be the last dealership to consider.
4.5,1,"We were in Mesa shopping for a gently used RV.  We pulled into their lot and parked.  One of their salesmen was standing in the lot and asked what we were looking for.  When we said a used 5th Wheel, he rudely said, ""Don't have any"" and walked away.  Nothing else - just walked away.  Wow."
4.5,4,"My wife and I traveled from Tucson AZ to Mesa AZ RV hunting after exhausting dealerships here.  Our goal...late model class C easy to set up and easy take-down ready for road travel as we're getting up in age.
We met Howard at Paul Everets RV after seeing the positive reviews.  Howard showed us around and we liked a Thor motorhome surprised that it met all of our needs and offered other helpful items...we hadn't heard of a Thor before.  Matt, the finance guy worked hard to obtain financing with little down and he also managed to include every after sale add-on he could.  The service guys removed a jack-knife sofa and replaced it with a small double recliner we purchased.  They also installed a sat radio antenna for a price as the stock radio didn't offer Serius XM.  They checked over the 2016 used RV with less than 10,000 miles and corrected a few problems then a service tech gave us the nickel tour.  We drove it home and found we couldn't get the porch light to turn off.  Howard was called and with some help determined it was the remote control--yes, this RV had a remote control to do all the set-up stuff.  Howard was great.  We hope everyone has as good an experience buying their first RV."
4.5,5,"I know, Camping World is just down the street and they aren't bad. RV Trader is the local guy you've always done business with, the one with the good advice and a special price for regulars. Well stocked for a smaller shop but very big in service. We have a large 5th wheel and a smaller travel trailer that have a lot of parts in them from these folks. When your RV is in for a repair or service, they will look them over for other problems you may not be aware of. If they don't have a part, they have a warehouse nearby that probably does. Lots of RV shops on main but I've gotten good service from these folks for over two years now."
4.5,5,People if you want the best experience ever purchasing and RV I would definitely recommend Paul Everts RV. There is a specific young salesman there named Ryan that I have the up most respect for. We bought our motor home from him and unfortunately hit something in the road and had to come back to get it fixed. Ryan bought us a cab to get home ($200 trip because we live in flagstaff) and did not want us to repay him. Keep in mind this was 6 months after we bought our RV from him. I hope all who sees the reviews on here will try and work with this young man. He absolutely deserves your business. Also the sales process is amazing everyone there was very helpful!!!!
4.5,5,"Great place to buy an RV everyone was super nice 
And very understanding. Our sales person Kelly went above and beyond to answer all our questions and concerns. Even after the purchase they continue to go above beyond to satisfy our questions and concerns. Great company good experience."
4.5,5,"QUALITY and QUANTITY at its finest!!!  If you want to feel like family, this is the RV Dealership for you.  We drove all the way from San Diego to get our New Montana RV.  

Rodney is the nicest guy around and works with you to get the best RV within your budget.  

Jennifer was so patient and answered all of our questions along the way being that we were from out of town; this helped ease our anxiety.  

Jeff did an AWESOME walk through with us and showed us EVERYTHING and explained in detail every part of the trailer. He also took one of the pictures below

Ryan was extremely friendly and took us through all the financing options to a monthly price that we were comfortable with.  

Before leaving, Laura so graciously showed us everything that we need to buy for our trailer to hook it up. There was a lot of miscellaneous things that we didn't even realize our trailer didn't have like a hose and water regulator, etc...

Thank you all so much for working with us so diligently to have an amazing experience for our first trailer. We will definitely be back if we ever trade it in for another one in the future."
4.5,4,"Treated well by salesman, Service manager and Corp. Finance Director resulting in us purchasing our dream coach.  The service after the sale, before delivery was thorough and very professional.  Ryan Outon was our sales guy and he was very good and responsive to our many questions.  

Having lived in Fresno, CA for 35 years we have known PE RV for years and it was not always positive, but the crew in Mesa took great care of us and we could not be happier!"
4.5,5,"Got a great deal on a used travel trailer here. Had been shopping for months when I came across a craigslist listing from Paul Evert's for a 2010 Kodiak trailer at a very, very fair price. Thought surely there was something wrong with it, but after a thorough check out, I had absolutely no reason not to pay the asking price. According to the dealer, it had sat on the lot for too long and they needed to make room for new trailers, so they put a rock-bottom price on it as a ""loss leader"" to drive Internet business. Anyway, whatever the reason, I highly recommend this dealership whether you are looking for a great used to travel trailer or a half million dollar diesel pusher. They've got it all and Rodney our salesman did us right. Furthermore, Lance and the service staff went over and above my expectations, making sure the trailer was ready to go. I pretty much figured that at the price, I was going to have to fix all the little things, but they went over the trailer quite thoroughly, even sanitizing the freshwater tank (which was a bit smelly after sitting half full of water for god knows how long), reattaching things that had come loose, fixing the awning, replacing propane hoses, installing a new deep cycle battery, and checking all the major systems to make sure the water heater, air conditioner, refrigerator, furnace, etc. all worked. even found a couple of missing parts for the used equalizer hitch we had picked up somewhere, and got it all attached and ready to go for us. Really could not have asked for better service, I am totally impressed. When I am finally made of money and am in the market for a $500,000 diesel pusher, I'll be shopping here first!"
4.5,5,Cant believe how smooth the process of purchasing my first R.V. Went!!!!!!! My great experience started with deacon in sales he showed me exactly what I asked for and was incredibly knowledgeable! You would not even know this man was a salesman not pushy at all and so easy going.  We picked the unit we liked and set down with matt in finance who actually got us better financing than we came in with and was the friendliest guy you will ever meet he even came out to check out our new coach! He said he wanted to be the first to knock on our door lol..... good guy!!! And last but not least neldon the service manager holds his techs to high standards I had a list of things I saw that needed fixed and he brought me out to his tech jeff for me to go over the list! All the repairs were completed in a timely manner and exceeded my expectations they went completely through the used unit and even fixed things I did not see!!! We are happy campers thank you guys so much this is really the best purchase experience my wife and I have ever experienced you have customers for life!!!!!!
4.5,5,"My husband and I were shopping for a trailer on and off for a few months. Stopped into RV Traders.  Really liked what we saw and liked the very relaxed atmosphere.  No hard sell here.  We purchased a new trailer and, since they have service right on the premises, they did all the personalized work we wanted,  Excellent work.  Very good experience.  See Jack if you want a great buying experience and/or service on your existing rig."

4.5,5,"Honest people, great prices.  A business run the right way.  Jack was the best. No high pressure.  We would shop here again."
4.5,5,The absolute best place to buy or trade an RV in Arizona! Stand up business with family values! There is no other place I'll go!
1,1,"Avoid this place! I made arrangements for a monthly stay. They required a background check for monthly residents. Daily and weekly, no check necessary. Makes no sense but sent the background check paperwork 2 weeks before arrival. Called the day after sending to confirm receipt of paperwork and was confirmed. Drove 1400 miles with a 42' 5th wheel for them to tell me that no paperwork was received and my spot was not available. The spot WAS available but they did not process my background check so would not allow me to enter. This is high season and finding another spot is proving impossible. 
They were not even apologetic. The manager glared as I complained. 
P.S. They were well aware that I am a retired war veteran. 
Thanks for my service!"
1,1,"Needed a safe place to park for one night, dump the tanks, and take a shower.  The check in process was slow but not out of the ordinary.  Mentioned that we had a van style RV and the lady said park in #8 which I did.  Quickly hooked up the power and left to attend a wedding.  When I got back a few hours later I noticed that the sewer connection was a foot off the ground in a planter with grass.  Our van style RV was low to the ground and could not connect.  I tried calling the office and only got voicemail.  The office was closed at this point.  The extra dump station behind the office on the map she handed us was non existent and covered over.  There were several weird people walking around the campground and quietly watching us.  About ten people were lined up at the bathroom I would guess to take a shower.  Several cats were roaming about.  A couple dogs were barking non stop behind us.  The whole place creeped us out so we unhooked the power and left that night.  So for $26 I got a few hours of power and memories of a poorly run RV park.  With tanks almost full and no shower, we drove over to Camping World across town and had a wonderful peaceful night for free."
1,2,"Just don't. $14 for 1 person or ?21 for 2 plus a $10 bathroom key deposit. We only stayed here because the RV broke down and I bought a tent at Target to have a cheaper vacation. There were be available hotels, so here we are. The bathrooms are clean, so I gave another star. There's highway noise on both sides, but it was convenient."
3.5,5,"My review has taken me longer than I wanted to get posted, but I've got nothing but Outstanding accolades to say about Apache RV.  They are an extremely busy facility to get scheduled into, but I can only say that it was well worth the wait.  I was apprehensive about having a residential refrigerator replaced because of what is entailed to do this job.  Tom assured me that they could and would do a good job, and they did just that, only it was a FANTASTIC job.  In fact I was so pleased that I tasked them to do a closet modification in the rear of our coach for a shoe rack.  This again was done to perfection and we are pleased with the finished result.  Our only drawback was the wait time to get scheduled into Two Bears custom RV shop, but guaranteed worth the wait. 
If the need ever arises for future work that they can handle I will definitely go back, and highly recommend others who wish to or have a need for modifications. 
Thanks again to Tom, Two Bears, and the crew in the shop, outstanding work!"
3.5,1,Positively the worst experience ever!  I will never let these guys work on anything I own!  Owner was rude and disrespectful.
3.5,1,"So as an UPDATE to the owner's comments about ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"". I'm so glad that he decided to focus on this simple fact as this should be the final nail in the coffin for potential customers; as anyone can read right through those lines. In essence they admit that they overcharge their customers; as an excuse for anyone else in town not being capable. The issue here is that the owner is essentially saying; you're going to overpay with us but we're going to do the job right. What a load of crap...You should be providing the best quality work possible for the most competitive price. Just because you ONLY HAVE 1 SERVICE BAY doesn't mean that each customer should have to PAY DEARLY. As I've stated before, charge fairly for your work and do a great job - this will allow you to succeed; otherwise I bet that you will not be in business 1 year from now. And yes this is America, land of the free; so STOP TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE of your neighbors. Gee guess what? A sour owner's response gets a Yelp update; which creates yet another negative stars line for the business - nice!"
3.5,5,"This place is awesome! We had our RV remodeled there. They were fantastic to work with, fair in every aspect! We couldn't be happier and would not hesitate to use them anytime in the future."
3.5,1,"These guys are the newest Las Vegas RV customization RIP-OFF EXPERTS. Want new floors in your Class A, that'll be $12,000. Want a custom TV entertainment setup, that'll be $25,000. I mean seriously these guys are BONKERS! Oh and on top of all that they won't even come to you for an estimate; that's right you'll be bringing your coach all  the way to them to sucker you in...NOT! BTW you do want to know more about their ""Top Secret high quality  brand of Luxury Vinyl Tile"" flooring they use;  it's called ToMkt Ozogrip. That brand of flooring is quite awesome for RV use; just not at the rip off labor and material rates they charge you here to install it. Tip to the owner... Don't try to retire on each and every job; rather charge fair rates and grow your business. Other RV flooring shops will install same material in a 40' Class A for $5 - $6k. Why do you need to make double? You need to seriously re-think your position if you plan to stay in business."
3.5,1,"Worst experience ever.  I would leave negative stars if I could.  No customer service, no call back from owner after my RV was vandalized while stored here.  Just atrocious and completely unprofessional."
3.5,5,"We could not recommend this place more! We have a Canadian made trailer with which US RV repair places are unfamiliar, especially the hydraulic roof which opens the clamshell type trailer. This is the only place that we found that took the time to familiarize itself with our problems and the owner himself came out to supervise the work. In the end they actually offered us a cheaper solution than we had envisioned and also advised us on the right battery and how to best deal with a truma combi fridge.We do not live in NV, but we would bring our trailer, an Alto 1713, here before bringing it to any place in our home state. They are honest, extremely knowledgeable, and give you a time slot in which everything is actually done!"
3.5,1,"**UPDATE** If the owner (Two Bears) would stop trying to antagonize me (the reviewer); then perhaps I might move past this whole entire accurate original review of his company. But sadly low and behold he thinks that I'm a ""troller"" (never even heard of his description of this until now). Rest assured that I am just a very truthful and forthright reviewer. Many of my reviews are negative, but many are positive and some right in the middle. But nonetheless they are ALL truthful, and my original review of Apache RV stands as such. I have always tried to be forthcoming to other patrons who might wish to be forewarned; about firms that try to take advantage of their potential customers. That being said, it is sad that this owner feels I am not real, when in fact I am. So much so that sometimes I even remove negative reviews after a period of time; if I feel differently or hear or personally experience that things have changed with a business. Obviously nothing has changed here...."
3.5,1,Worst RV dealer in the valley.  Still no call back from owner or even a call about the  replacement of stolen items from my RV.
3.5,5,"I am so impressed with Tom and Two Bear (yes that is his name) from start to finish they were great to deal with and worked with my budget to take care of all my repairs and remodel of my 1996 Winnebago Brave. We are very happy with the way everything came out and looks, can't wait to take it on a trip....Thanks guys you are the best."
4.5,5,It's absolutely beautiful and quiet here. The people in the office were so friendly and accommodating. They even have complimentary dog treats and poop bags for your dogs and a nice fenced in area for them to rip and run. Scenery is beautiful and they have a nice lake with plenty of spots to sit and take in the view. You couldn't beat the price either. This is the first campground we have taken our pull behind and I'm glad this was it. Great spaces and they have sites with water and electric hookup. We will definitely be back!
4.5,5,Great park.  Very quiet.  Folks who own and work at the office are extremely accommodating.  Clean Restrooms and showers.  Lovely shady setting with ample space!  We stayed here on a weekend while getting our RV fixed and came back.  Lots of golf close by.
4.5,5,"Great campground, very clean and well kept with friendly and helpful staff. Campsites are spacious with full hook-ups. Close enough to 57 for easy access but far enough away to not have road noise. Did not fish but talked to a camper who was and he had caught a couple of bass. Great campground to stay at if you are visiting U of I."
4.5,1,So we are on our first RV trip and we weren't going to make it to our scheduled stop so I called this place at 11:45pm to ensure there was space. In all honesty I thought I'd at least get an answering machine with late registration instructions. To my surprise a man answers. Immediately he berated me on what time it is! Then said he wasn't taking people. I was shocked!! First of all of it's too late why are you answering the phone?? Second did you seriously deny me service cause you didn't feel like being inconvenienced at your job?? Obviously not friendly here!!! Stay away!
4.5,5,"Incredibly clean, immaculate bathrooms and shower. Owner is very very friendly."
4.5,4,Park is beautiful and quite. Bathrooms do need a upgrade other wise GREAT park. Host were very helpful and polite.
4.5,4,"Wow, took a while to find a place to stay for the night but glad I found this wonderful location.  Just purchased a camper and traveling home. I called D&W to check on availability as I was about 30 minutes outside of Champaign, IL.  They were very accommodating and were waiting for me to arrive (after hours).  Very friendly, beautiful setting.  Don't let the proximity to highway concern you.
Would have given 5 stars however bathrooms could be updated a bit."
4.5,5,Very nice campground with very friendly owners. They help you in any way they can and even pick up your trash daily. Very pleasant surroundings.
4.5,5,We had a great weekend here! Very clean and peaceful! Our dog loved the dog park and walking around the lake! Really friendly owner who made sure we had everything we needed! Definitely will be back!
4.5,5,"The campground is very clean, the staff very polite, and the location is great. It's a little close to the interstate, but when your front door is an interstate when you're at home, then a couple blocks away is bliss.

The bathrooms here as well, extremely clean and you don't get that most places. While I was there, most campers kept to themselves and said hi as you walked by. The fishing isn't all that, but partially because it was windy and I wasn't trying very hard.

Overall, I was very thrilled with this campground and will be back later this year."
4.5,4,"I'd definitely give this a 4 plus.  Great location, friendly staff, clean, and just an enjoyable place. We only stayed one night on our way north, but had a great experience.  It would get a five, but I only give those to RV Resorts.  We travel in a coach and really appreciate concrete pads, but this is a GREAT place and we loved it there.  By all means, give it a try!!!"
4.5,5,Only was able to stay one night but the place was great.  Very quite with lots of grass and a very large private lake that you can walk around or fish on. The owner was most helpful and pleasant.
4.5,4,"The campground was easy to find, just off Interstate 57. Our space was a pull through, looking at the fields that surround the campground. The campground had a pond and a few spots around it, but we were two rows over from the pond, which was fine. The campground's proximity to the highway is close, but the noise was minimal... I slept great the three days we were there.

Our space was unpaved, but level. The hookups were convenient. The nightly rate was inexpensive.

Would I recommend this park? Yes. Would we come back? Yes.

Informational: We travel in a 36' Class A RV."
4.5,5,"We stopped her on our way back to Chicago.  We arrived (w/o a reservation) and the gentleman who checked us in was amazing. We had rented an RV from Cruise America and he was so helpful in making sure we knew everything we needed. Stayed with us to make sure the electrical and water hook ups were working. Even have me a pair of gloves the next morning to clean out the waste water from the RV.  They are able to fill up propane (which as a nervous nelly was grateful for someone who knew what they were doing).  Definitely recommend this place.

Lovely space with fenced in dog run, pond with lovely walking path, small play area for the kids.

and of course the cutest cat Smokey who greeted us when we arrived and saw us off."
5,5,"Awesome experience with this company. The RV we rented ""Majestic"" was very clean and well kept. There were no hidden charges and both Michelle and Phil provided excellent customer service. We will certainly rent from them again in the future."
5,5,Great service and fair prices without hidden fees or last minute charges.  Great RV rental experience
5,5,"Great Prices, Easy Rental, Easy contact during rental for extra explanations as needed. High quality equipment and Service. Will definitely come back to rent again!"
5,5,"This was our first time renting an RV and the staff (Mitch) could not have been more helpful. The RV was fully stocked with all of the essentials we needed (pots & pans, cleaning supplies, etc). The prices were very fair and we enjoyed our week long trip in our RV."
5,2,"For the most part our experience was ok. We rented the RV for a week in January. It was the first time we had rented an RV, and they were nice and spent time answering our questions. We rented the Chevy GulfStream. Having the linens and bath towels supplied was very helpful as was the easy living package. The RV itself was in decent condition. It was very clean. The sink in the bathroom seemed to leak which we didn't realize until we stopped, 4 hours from where we picked up the RV, but it was manageable. The blinds on the rear window that looked in on the bed didn't work, so we had to hang a sheet there to get some privacy. The RV drove fine however, so those were relatively minor concerns. 

We had a morning flight to catch so we dropped off the RV about a half hour before someone was going to be in the office. On the one hand, it was nice they offered this option. However, we came to regret it. We dropped off the RV in the same condition  in which we had picked it. This was a little before 8 on a Saturday morning on a quiet street. Five days later, I first heard back from them with a final invoice charging us for a crack in the windshield. They sent a picture of the RV not in the same location in which we had dropped it off (it had been moved to a back parking lot) with the windshield cracked. There was definitely no crack or chip in the windshield when we dropped it off. Because we didn't turn it over to someone in person, though, and had no way to prove when that crack happened, they held us responsible and charged us to fix the windshield. This is why I gave them only 2 stars. If you're turning in the RV and someone is there to inspect it and hand the keys to, you're probably ok."
5,5,"Excellent service, good prices, easy pick up and drop off. Reasonable charges for draining/filling/cleaning, if you opt to not do it yourself. Prompt response to calls. The only problem was with the electrical system, failed on the third day. Not their fault, and they handled it well. I highly recommend and will be renting from them again."
5,5,Hightened Path RV Rentals helped me out for Country Thunder when I needed rentals. It was my first time ever renting RVs so I was totally clueless.  Michelle met me and walked me through the different options.  They were so easy to work with.  The process from beginning to end was very easy from pick up to drop off and the units were so nice and clean.  Everyone I worked with were great.  I highly recommend them for any of your events and travels.
5,5,"Very helpful and flexible. We had to wait to the last minute to book our RV. He was very accommodating. Great location near the airport. We were able to take a cab ride to the pick up location. We had the RV for a week, no problems at all."
5,5,I recently rented and RV from Hightened Path and could not have been more pleased with the experience. I had never rented or driven an RV before and was not familiar with how they operated. The RV was in very good condition and Phil explained everything in detail and made the trip very easy. He let me know right off the bat that if I had any questions during my trip to feel free to contact him and he would help. He even returned some towels that we had left in the RV to our house!! Very good guy and company. Next time I need an RV I know exactly who I'm calling first
5,5,"We had a great experience with Philip and Michele here in AZ. We were new to the RV experience and Michele was very patient with us at pick up. The unit was immaculate, comfortable, everything in working order. We had a great trip and it was the best price. No issues here - will definitely use again and recommend to everyone we know. Thanks!!"
5,5,"We rented the Ford Majestic and had a majestic vacation!!
Philip was very informative and helpful in our planning ahead of time.  We had a great experience with Michele during our pick up, she was very descriptive with how everything works, and even so kind to respond to some late night text messages when we had a few questions!  
The RV had everything we needed and more!! Some previous renters had left some cooking essentials we forgot, and we too left some things that the next person may find their without.  Philip was very timely with billing upon returning.  We had a wonderful experience and look forward to using them again!"
5,5,"The best place to rent an RV! Great prices, clean and updated units and Philip and Michele were awesome. Will only be renting from them in the future!!"
5,5,"I am once again amazed at the level of customer service from Michele and Philip.  I have rented RV's for over 13 years from a variety of places, but I hit the jackpot when I found Heightened Path over 3 years ago. They have always provided great customer service from the first time I contacted them. You know the saying- you never really know how good someone is until it the chips are down.  Well, this year there was some mechanical issues with my RV rental, and they were at the mercy of the mechanic to get it repaired and our trip was delayed for over a day. When Philip called to tell me what had happened, the tone of his voice told me he was just as upset as I was.  Michele kept in constant contact with me over the next 2 days with a progress report. Yes, my trip was significantly impacted, as was the 4 people with me and this could have been a nightmare. But Michele and Philip were sincerely apologetic at every opportunity, and went above & beyond to ensure I was taken care of in every single way without me having to ask.  They took a bad situation and made it work out just fine.  Will I continue to rent from them -- YOU BET I WILL!!!  This is one business that knows what great customer service looks like!"
5,5,"Fair rates and great customer service. Philip was always quick with an email response to questions I had leading up to our trip, even on weekend nights. Wouldn't hesitate to rent from again."
5,5,"You cannot find a better RV rental company than Hightened Path.  They are always professional and respectful, but very friendly at the same time. Michelle is a very genuine person and you can tell she enjoys her company. The entire rental process and return is easy with no hidden charges.  I have rented from them for 3 years and have never had 1 issue, not even a small one!"
5,5,"Another year has come around, and I am still extremely satisfied with my rental from Hightened Path.  We rented a different RV for our yearly trip, but it was still smooth as silk. From the initial reservation with Philip, to the drop off with Michele- outstanding experience.  I cannot tell you what a great option it is to be able to leave a vehicle in a secure parking area when we pick up the RV. I no longer have to have someone drop me off or pick me up when we return- NO ONE else has ever offered this perk. I tell all my friends and family how good this business is, I just can't imagine using anyone else but Hightened Path!"
5,5,"I have to say that this company is awesome. Philip and his partner in Arizona, Michelle, were both so nice and helpful during our trip out West with our first RV rental.

We had a great trip and though we had some issues that I consider normal with an RV, Philip just could not have been more available and helpful in getting them solved. 

There's not much more I can say really except that I think that these people obviously  run their business with people's well-being in mind ....pretty rare these days but very nice to see."
5,5,"We just returned from another awesome weekend in a RV from Hightened Path Rv!  I have been renting RV's for over 12 years, and I cannot express how happy I am to have found these people to rent from.  This is only my second rental, but it is such a pleasure compared to the previous places I have rented from.  Philip is very quick to get you the information for you to choose which RV you would like (they have a great selection) and takes all the information he needs from you at one time.  There are no ""extra fees or hidden charges"" on your bill.   Michelle works with you to arrange a pick up time that works for your schedule and she makes it a quick friendly process.  The Rv is out front, refrigerator on, ready to pull away!  I have never had 1 single issue on either trip and the Rv is even a bit older than others I have rented from before and I had all kinds of problems with them- This just reinforces the incredible care and conditioning that Hightened Path does to maintain their fleet. The return process is just as organized and Michelle always wants to know if we had fun!  I will never rent from any where else- and recommend them to every person who talks about renting an RV.  Try them- you will not be disappointed!!!!!
AZ101"
3.5,5,Thanks again to Scott & Todd at Cactus RV Center. Great hooking up with you two at the Los Angeles boat show this past weekend. You made it really easy for me to pick a new pontoon 2018 Berkshire rfx CTS with Honda 250 horsepower outboard. Couldn't have done it without you. I will highly recommend you to family and friends
3.5,5,"Couldn't be happier with our Berkshire tritoon purchase! We had looked all around Lake Havasu for the right boat since it was our first boat purchase. After the usual dealership rundown with a few in town and price changes when we would end up driving back out and having a whole different scenario presented once in person we had almost given up the search. Just at that time Cactus had reduced a Berkshire my husband had been eyeing into our price range. Scott the owner was very helpful in working out a deal, he even helped us with out trade in as well and was more generous than we could of asked for. Jamie the sales manager has been awesome, had helped us through all paperwork needed for our credit union before driving back out and was so fast and efficient, the day we came to pick it up it was there cleaned up and ready no changes, pricing was all the same no headache. Jamie took us down to the water and oriented us to our new addition and we couldn't be more thankful, making purchases such as these can be very stressful but Jamie and Scott helped take that away and was always a phone call away with any questions we had. Thank you both and Cactus RV center we have already let people know that have asked or commented our boat where to go for there new purchase!"
3.5,1,"Decided to go through a dealer so it was an easier process. Very easy to coordinate until I signed the papers. It took a month to get the boat registration that I paid for at closing and I still have to go down to game and fish and put it in my name. The 45 day temp tag expired and i'm having to hassle them to try and get the trailer registered in my name with plates. I am now going to have to buy a new 30 day permit which I already paid for one, just to take my boat out. 
Once you sign the papers they do not continue with good service. I will go back to buying from private sellers after this experience. 
I even paid a couple grand more than what the boat was worth in order to not have the hassle. I was wrong."
3.5,5,"Being new to the RV world, this company rocked it. Terry and Sue, went above and beyond customer service. Easy access into the lock (with MANY cameras) nice size parking stalls, covered and clean as a whistle! We were able to leave our RV with confidence that it was safe and secure. If we were need to storage our RV we will use them. Thank you guys for taking good care of the""Beast"""
3.5,1,"Sorry we left out rv there. Came back to get it and it was filled with sawdust from the engine to inside. Reason:
Someone was hired to build stuff using sawhorses and electric saws continually.
Another person came as well and same thing. Couldn't complain to office because management quit and not a person around. Office locked...
You'll be sorry if you store anything there."
3.5,5,"Love the family that manages this place. Always happy, helpful and friendly. Prices are the best in town too!!"
2.5,1,Do not make a mistake on your booking or the hotel will screw you and charge you for a night even when you try to cancel the booking minutes later.
2.5,2,"We came once before and we decided to return because we like the 1 bedroom suite. The lady at the counter was so nice with us, nothing to complaint about the customer service.  The room was decent like before, not like a surgery room but clean.  The problem is when you decide to come during the summer when is hot and the air conditioning unit is not designed to work efficiently.   The room at the entrance were the main AC unit is located is really cold enough.  But the second room is nearly compared with the outside temperature. It have a little air vent behind a TV stand but you really don't feel any air coming out from there.  To have a little air amount on that vent we had to cover the main unit with pillows but was not enough. The room temperature was totally uneven. I had a terrible night!!
Room cleanup came while we was here in our first day but they did not return. We found the room exactly how we left it.  
Next time probably we will look for another place to stay."
2.5,2,Rooms need additional updating. Pull out couch would be nice. Biggest issue is ac only in front room so king bed and bathroom area don't get ac unless door open the whole time. So my room was hot. Tub needed to be repaired. Bed hard. Carpet dirty.
2.5,5,"The ambiance in the Bingo Hall is excellent and all the callers and staff are super friendly. 
But unhappy with their Lucky Slot Players....just saying,"
2.5,5,"I got a good deal for Our New years day vacation from Vegas.com.I Was a bit hesitant because the price seem to good to be true! $638.00. For 3 rooms (Dec. 30 2014-Jan.2  2015=3 nights) !! When we arrived the check in was fairly easy and fast.Out of the 3 rooms only one had a smelly carpet by the entrance of the room.I let them know about it and was immediately moved to another room without any problemFor breakfast we went to their buffet,which was also a big hit! The price was good i believe about $64 for 7 adults!! The selection was good not over the top but good.Specially the roast beef which actually had good flavor and the made to order charbroiled hamburgers and fries!! The desserts were good also.Overall a good place to stay will definitely come back here!!"
2.5,2,"On the one hand; the staff was nice, the room was good for the price, and the rooms aren't attached to the main casino- it was nice being a bit apart from all the dinging slots. On the other hand; woke up at 7 am to pounding on my next door neighbors door, and an officer yelling ""SECURITY, OPEN UP NOW!!!!"". I couldn't tell if the people hanging around the place we're homeless, or guests ... everyone seemed to be in some stage of inebriation or undress ... but then again, it is Vegas."
2.5,1,"Well rooms umm the suite had 2 beds Ava. Last minute trip to Vegas rooms where iffy there was a couch but looked dirty I used a blanket to sit down,bathrooms where clean, staff nice but the place looked like I was back in los angeles watts ..... people wondering about bums sitting around with there bags scattered, when I seen security riding around on bike made me think more than once. Place was quite but then again I was plastered so really passed out."
2.5,3,"If you like ""Locals Casinos"", AC's is fairly decent. There's a large array of penny machines for those who like 'em, and quite a few table games. The dealers are fun and friendly. Could use some more quarter and dollar machines, though."
2.5,5,"In a day and age where customer service is sorely lacking, I really enjoyed the courtesy my family was show at Arizona Charlie's Boulder. We needed two rooms and the svelte lady, with short dark hair, at the front desk was so very kind to us! My adult daughter wanted her own room, and this sweet lady found a room right next door to us. This made it easier on our family to spend time together. It may seem like such a small thing , but I really appreciate her thoughtfulness & consideration. She went the ""extra mile"" for us which is so rare in today's "" me first world""! Keep up the good work!!  The housekeepers were also very nice & deserve to be tipped for their work, which I am careful to do on a daily basis. My room was very tidy & clean. They even took the time to set the alarm clock to the right time, something I didn't do before because I was too busy. I will admit, the room was basic, but that doesn't bother me. I didn't come there to LV to camp in my Hotel room!! It's Vegas, baby!!! I enjoyed the bars, discounted drinks, live music, buffets, and restaurants there. Everyone was very kind to us!  The room rate was extremely reasonable. I really enjoyed staying here & will come again!!!"
2.5,1,This place is a dump..it's even worse than the other one on Decatur..several years ago it used to be like a budget suites weekly joints and lets just say they still have the same undesirables that hang around there mostly prostitutes & dopers/tweakers...
2.5,1,"Note: This review is strictly for the RV Park. Called this afternoon to seek some information. Woman with Hispanic accent was very short/not interested. I asked to speak to the decision maker and she was very rude. When I asked for the manager's name, she simply hung up on me. I called back right away and she hung up on me again. This tells me one of two things - Either the manager has not trained his employees to exemplify correct phone skills and be courteous to callers who are being courteous to them regardless of the reason for calling, or this woman doesn't want her manager to know how rude she is when someone calls. A little training goes a long way. Who do you want representing your organization? This woman does you a disservice."
2.5,2,"~7 years ago my family enjoyed coming here for he breakfast buffet. It wasn't bad, it was filling and better that boulder station. Then we started going to the other azc for the buffet-oooh they had funky card symbol waffles. Then it got worse and worse and a lot of things became cold and unmixed and we stopped going."
2.5,4,"Returned over the holidays and was very pleased.  Front desk was very very helpful over the 4 days and 3 nights, room was very clean and spacious and this is the best value for a room in Vegas I think (just over $40 a night with taxes Mon-Wed before New Years).  Buffett was good, virtually no lines.  Gambling wasn't very good, but that really wasn't hotel's fault, casino is not very big but is perfect size for a small property.  Security was always around, either walking or on bikes.  You can hear noise from nearby rooms.  I would still return."
2.5,5,It was clean and quiet place to stay there. Clean room clean towel heater on . Everything was perfect.
2.5,3,Go play bingo! Didn't think I'd enjoy it but it was so much fun!! & their deli food is delicious. Recommend the wings. Can't really comment on anything else though.
2.5,1,Horrific hotel! Hair on bedding. Non-smoking rooms smell of smoke. Sink didn't drain. This dump is a refuge for chain smoking toothless gambling addicts.
2.5,2,"I dont like to leave bad reviews because I feel thats the only time people comment on yelp, however, I feel people should hear this. my husband and I moved down here from seattle for a job opportunity. While waiting for our apartment to be ready, we chose this place because as everyone knows, its far better then any of the suites around here. After a long stressful day of dealing with finding our apartment, I pulled back the sheets to the bed in the bedroom, and there were 3 large fresh poo stains on the sheets!! I was horrified!! I then looked up...to look away...and on the ceiling was a fairly large blood stain!! on the ceiling!!! We immediately called the front desk and got the voice mail so we left a msg. After about 30mins with no response, we had to change out of our pj's and walk all the way back to the front desk. The kid at the desk was very nice, and just as horrified as we werr when I showed him the pictures.(which I would attatch if I knew how!) He moved us to a new room, but was a non smoking because they had no more smoking rooms available, and it was a lot farther away and on 3rd floor...and elevators out of order of course! He gave us buffet passes for 3 meals each because he said that was all he could do, but would let the mgr. know and see what she could do for us. We never heard from her, no apologies or anything. I gave 2 stars because the rest of the staff was great, and our second room was much better. But the lack of empathy from management, and lack of communication, really irks me. I dont know that I would ever stay there again, or recommend it. Just think people should know and be warned! Who knows whats on that bedding you CANT SEE!!

***figured out pictures!"
2.5,5,"Why a five star?  Because they treat their people right. I play and eat there. Alot! Unlike Sunset Station, I never had a complaint. Always great service. Workers there even know my name.  I play alot, and win more than I do at other casinos.  I love their comp system there.  Better than I've seen at other casinos.  Soon, I'll be trying their steakhouse, and I'll let you know about that then.  Thank you AZ Charlie's for making a local feel at home!"
2.5,5,"Had brunch today at the buffet and they had Oxtails as one of the meats. I also had a ""real"" eggs benedict which almost doesn't exist in Vegas buffets. For someone who has lost 60 pounds in the last year I'm picky about not wasting calories on crummy food and Arizona Charlie's has the best buffet items that I can pick from."
2.5,5,"Can't really give any casino five stars because, let's face it, they are out to rob you blind. 

This is for the Cheesesteak Grill. Some of the best tasting, best priced cheesesteaks in the city. And now they have a few new offerings. Mmmm mmmm 

Only negative, the will not sauce your wings. Boo.  Un-sauced wings?  I won't eat them."
2.5,1,This hotel is the worse place to come to. They charge tou $11.99 a day for internet use. When other hotel has the internet for free. Plus I have a two children that drinks milk. So I asked for a a small refrigerator so in could store my kids food & milk. Never got the refrigerator but got charged. And our room keycard for our room did not work. Went to to the front desk explained ti them that the card was not working and then employee just walked away and left me hanging. Never came back. To everyone who is driving or visiting Vegas. Pleas please. Do not come to Arizona Charlie's Casinos Hotel on 4575 Boulder Hey.
2.5,3,"We were just passing through Las Vegas (not wanting to spend a night on the strip), so the hubby booked us into this hotel. Our room was on the third floor with an outside entrance, a good distance from the casino and the noise of the street. 

Other than the carpet feeling a little gritty, this was an A-OK place to spend a night, especially for the price ($48). The bathroom was clean and the bed linens felt freshly washed. We parked the car in a spot that had a light overhead and a view of it from our room. 

The bottom of the door had a crack to let in a draft but didn't let anything else in (critter-wise), which I didn't really expect being on the third floor. There was an elevator (stifling hot inside) that was handy to bring up the suitcases.

Free wi-fi worked fine and the location of the hotel was a plus for getting on the freeway heading to Phoenix the next day."
2.5,3,"This review is for the casino only. 

I had a lot of fun at the casino and although I didn't win much, my grandmother did. There is a large selection of games to play, your ""typical"" casino, I guess. 

The service people were nice, however, the cocktail waitress hardly ever came by. Also, one of the supervisors at the desk was rather...blunt, to put it mildly."
2.5,2,"I gamble quite a bit so I also receive a lot of promotional offer in the mail. 
Well I received some offers and so I thought I would head over to ACB's and let me tell you that they really need to have HR talk to the staff behind the counters for the players club. The person talked down to me and acted as if I was bothering her because I was asking a few questions about how to use my card.
I even asked why she was talking to me so rude and her reply was ""I told you once already!""
Well I finally had one of the security people give us help cause he had overheard the girl being rude to me. So I will say to anyone that asks from now on about Arizona's that it has low rent employees and they shouldn't bother. Plenty of other spot here to choose from and not get bullied.
Liam
Ps; However I did win over $200 on the advertisements offer of $10free slot play for the hassle. Funny she had told me I didn't have free play too. Hmmm"
2.5,4,"RV RESORT REVIEW My wife and I stayed her for three days in April 2014.   First off,  we called ahead and asked if our four Chihuahuas would be a problem.  They said if the dogs were well behaved it would not be a problem.  So first positive,  while they say they have a two dog limit,  if your dogs behave they will let you stay with more.   Do not lie to yourself about your dogs behavior,   do not screw it up for the rest of us,   if your dogs do not follow commands and behave,  do not push the limits.     The pads are concrete which is nice.  Level which helps level the unit.   We had a 27 foot travel trailer and this was the easiest leveling job we ever had.   That is the second plus.    The dog run was OK but small.   We had to wait until those with big dogs to leave before we could take our Chihuahuas in.   I would have to say that is the first negative,   they need two dog runs,  one for each size.     Driving in was easy,   the turns were easy and  space was good.   I have recommended this park to a friend as a good place to locate,  close to down town and the strip.   I would say it is not so hot for families with small kids."
2.5,4,"When I checked in I was told that I wasn't getting the roll away bed for my room that was asked for and paid for in my reservation 4 months ago. 

I asked to speak with a manager, was told by front desk none were working except Security. 

Security Manager Kyle came to my room, was professional and empathetic with my situation. He provided me with management's contacts and gave free buffet coupons. 

About a 1/2 hour later he returned with a roll away bed that he found on property. 

Initial bad situation turned for the  better!  Thank you Security Manager Kyle and Arizona Charlie's, I will be back!!"
2.5,1,"Staying at the rv park. If there was wifi would have given 4 or maybe even 5 stars. Place is clean, excellent security, food is pretty good at the restaurant but order burgers well done or they will be raw in the middle. We talked to restaurant management months ago, burgers are still raw. We've stayed many times in the last few years, it's near everything we need while in this city but due to BAD or nonexistence wifi I won't stay here again. It's not just this visit the wifi is bad. it's every visit. I shouldn't have to find a ride to McD's or Staples or Panda to make dr. appts, check on my mother, let my son know where I am or do banking.
Also no can/bottle/plastic recycling. They could donate the cans. 
Don't like to bitch but feel like I have too. I mentioned to lady at desk months ago about the lousy wifi and she told me no one else ever complained. Not true, I asked many fellow rver's if their internet was good and they laughed. What internet they said. 
Update on Rv Park: We got stuck in Vegas due to doctor's appts and are still staying here. The wifi sucks more and more everyday. Once we leave here we will never come back."
2.5,3,"This is a simple, with basic frills.  The room we stayed in had two basic rooms.  We stayed with four people in the suite with a double and a king size bed in the other room.  The main bedroom had the sink right next to the bed which was a little nasty.  Each time someone had to use it I was sleeping right next to it.  He bathroom shower was always riddled with a slow clog.  It's to be expected with the price you to pay to stay there. It's really far from the strip so plan at least a 20-30 minute commute.  

This place is nothing great but not horrible either."
2.5,3,"2.5/3 for the hotel, 4 for the casino food deals and service

HOTEL (REALLY A MOTEL): Rooms are very basic, comparable to budget chains like Motel 6 and Super 8. No resort fee, but also no WiFi -- 12 bucks a day extra if you want that. Needless to say no in-room coffee, fridge or micro either. But it was clean enough, and maybe I just got lucky but it was quiet enough, and on booking sites you can get weekends for around $40 after tax sometimes. I would imagine Aceplay members can also get discounts and comps relatively easily since the rooms are so basic. OK in a pinch just to save money, at least if you bring your own wifi or don't need it. 

CASINO: Looked like some OK pay tables, decent locals-focused place, honestly I didn't gamble here at all or poke around the machines much though. Points and tiers are shared between the other AZ Chuckles location and the Stratosphere. 

FOOD: This is where the place really shined, the little grill on the first floor of the casino and the Sourdough Cafe upstairs had all sorts of nice deals, customer service was great, food was very solid. 10% discount on the already good prices for the most basic level of Aceplay cards and apparently discounts go up with the tiers too"
2.5,2,Not that big of a selection at the buffet but the prime rib was good....the price is cheap and so is the food
2.5,1,"We spent three nights in Las  Vegas! THE westgate 4 two nights,supposed to be at Az Charlies for  one more, luckily we cancelled one night of Arizona Charlie's Boulder we tried to cancel 2! I won't get into that story. We arrived it took an hour and a half to be able to get to our room as a disabled person it was a nightmare the bugs I took pictures and movies of but I stopped and erased them because I decided we were moving on to a five star hotel in Newport Beach and I just want to keep moving forward luckily we only spent one night in this hell-hole it was disgusting grotesque and a lot more vile words that I could say! stay far away from this particular nightmare I lived 20 years in Vegas it happened to be a holiday weekend but I would have rather have slept in by car disgusting is an understatement vile and disgusting dead bugs dirt grotesque falling apart need I say more I think not"
2.5,2,"Considering the location of the hotel in proximity to the Strip or Convention Center and the price, I did not have very high expectations.  However, it was worse than I expected it to be.   
At check in the person checking us in was alone so she had to answer the phones continuously during our check in.   We checked in at 3pm so it there should have been another person there to help.   She must have stopped to answer the phone at least 6 times without once saying anything to us like ""excuse me, but I need to answer this call"" or ""I will be back in a moment, I have to answer this call'
"". She just rudely turned away, and was not very pleasant to the people calling in.   
We noticed mold on the walls in the bathroom, unfortunately it was in the morning when were were getting ready to shower and head out for the day or we would have asked to be given another room.    
We ate breakfast at the cafe and I ordered the steak and eggs.  The steak had a sour taste so I could not eat it.  I told the waiter but he did nothing.  
It's safe to say that I will NEVER stay at this hotel again.    
Rude service, hazardous, unhealthy rooms, and terrible food.  Not one redeeming quality."
2.5,1,"Absolutely a SHITHOLE..Buffet is Barffet.
Rude cocktail waitresses that never come around..ive waited up to 2 hours for a drink.
Very nasty rude woman name colleen working at the players club very very disrespectful piece of shit...very smokey environment with low class losers,homeless, hookers,pimps."
2.5,3,"The quality of the Sunday brunch buffet has gone down hill. Loaves of bread other in wrappers for everyone to reach into without tongs, basket of donuts in front of toaster for everyone to reach over to toast bread, no butter on line anywhere for toast, chicken fried steak was dry and terrible.  Rest of the line was ok."
2.5,1,"Our daughter lives in Vegas and had a ""local's"" coupon for a buy one get one free lunch or dinner buffet which we used. Had I paid full price I would have really been frustrated. Food was cold...the steam trays were NOT effective in keeping anything hot. Good way to produce bacteria and food poisoning. Would not recommend."
2.5,4,"Stayed here for EDC Friday night to Monday night. We got our hotel for a really cheap price for a decent hotel room. We got a room with a king bed that was separated from the other room with couches and a tv. Which was perfect 'cause it allowed the sleepy heads to be separate from the people who were awake. Downside was that the bathroom and sink was on the bedroom side, but we managed. The bathroom vent was really loud, so it may have woken up my friends a couple times.

The room wasn't massively huge or anything, but it was a decent size with a decent amount of floor space. The bed took up most of the room. The couch and the furniture in the other room could be moved to make more space for 4 or 5 people to all lie on the ground comfortably.

My friends thoroughly enjoyed the $5 steak and eggs. They would order two plates per person. I don't like steak so I got to enjoy the farmhouse special or something with was bacon and eggs for about $3 or $4. Also enjoyed their $1 mimosas!!! 

The service was ok but a bit slow. They seem to be understaffed, because there's only one person working the reception during non operating hours. Check in is around 3 pm, and check out is around 11 am, so I think around those times they will have 2. 

Whenever we wanted something we had to wait for awhile to get it. We wanted towels, but because we didn't want to wait, we went to get it from the pool instead. The pools is nice and modest, this hotel is nice and modest. We're not complaining for the price. 

The employees are friendly though."
2.5,3,"Ahhhh... Where do I start? Should I start with the local crackheads? The pimps or the ho's??  
I'll just start with why I gave them 3 stars. 

This establishment gets 3 stars cause of there customer services. Someone made an error on our reservations and we got upgraded to a suite and for even a less price so Kudos for that! 

On to the ratchet mess my godson who's 8yrs old,  his mom and myself had to witness. As we first pull up I see women with literally just thigh high boots, panties and a see through top along with another working girl with basically nothing on. I can't believe Arizona Charlie's allow them to be around the front doors like that. Seriously, we were greeted by them. WTF?  But hey it was late I had drove for hours and I was tired.

The room we had was nice and clean. The building was clean but why have all that going on at the front entrance where people and their family enters. 

The next morning we get up and get ready to head to breakfast at the local Denny's down the street and when we get off the elevator it was a man SMOKING CRACK!  Like right there smoking DOPE in the public. I said ""I can't do this"" so we went and checked out. I can't deal with Ho's AND crackheads!"
2.5,1,Worst stay ever!Checked in Friday March 23.Me and my friend went to Vegas for a friends wedding.If I could give Zero stars rooms were mediocre.But that's not even the issue.I was followed by head of Security Robert  klaus.like I was a criminal.My first time ever stepping in the casino other that registration that nite.7:30a.m. in morning I went into casino to check it out an look for my favorite game wheel of fortune but was harassed by security because of what only I could think of is the color of my skin.but at the time didn't know what to think as he cornered me told me I looked loss and I've been wondering around the  casino.(I thought that's what u do when you've never been to one before. I INFORMED HIM IT WAS MY FIRST TIME HERE AND I'M VIDEO CHATTING ON MY PHONE WITH MY FRIEND.IT CONTINUED TO QUESTION ME AND BY THE WAY  MY FRIEND ON MY PHONE HEARD HIS QUESTIONING ME AND UNBENOUNCED TO HIM HE WAS BEING RECORDED.I felt humiliated and went to complain to management.and was told I could leave a complaint with the same security office.which I did.I know this is a long but Am still distraught over this man and how I was cornered by not only him 'but as I was video chatting I review the video an showed it to family an seen a woman security as well behind me in back ground.Wowwww! What was a a middle aged blk woman no purse on her phone talking an being polite gonna do!  Please excuse the Rant or any misspellings.Never go to this Racist hotel!!
2.5,1,"Horrible hotel. Can hear every noise from adjacent rooms. Carpet had waves in it where it appeared it was coming unglued. No free wi-fi. Hotel registration staff were rude and unfriendly, as was most of the casino's entire staff that we came into contact with. They placed us on the entire opposite side of the hotel from the casino.  If you want to leave your room to go to the incredibly dated casino, you must safely traverse the parking lot filled with tweakers/homeless people. There is a homeless group that lives on the backside of the hotel. Not worth your time or safety to stay here."
2.5,5,"I had a really good experience here, room was cheap and clean, that's all I could ask for and the service was really good and over the phone with the reservation was perfect for me. In the casino, the drinks are really watered down, so you might as well ask for a glass of water. I was not expecting to win any money here. I came here because my neighbors recommended it and I could park my car outside my room and keep an eye on it.
Really good stay and I stayed for a few nights."
2.5,2,"No hot water, soap that doesn't lather."
2.5,4,"You get what you pay for.  Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed.  The most compelling reason why I won't stay at Arizona Charlie's again is all the smoke/smokers in the casino.  The help and service were great, Manny the bartender was amazing!!"
2.5,3,"We rented a room out for a baby shower that cost $50. They provided tables and chairs, the rest was up to us. The room was about 30x50sq.ft."
2.5,1,"Easily the worst room I ever ""stayed"" in. Got there the night after Christmas with family. Had booked a King Deluxe room through Expedia. When got to the room and it was 2 double beds in a dirty, disgusting room is disrepair. It looked like the kind of room that gets paid for by the hour.  We asked to leave to go find a real hotel room and they refused to refund me for that night, even though I didn't get what I booked and the room was nasty. I cannot advise enough to avoid this place like a disease--which might even by quite literal from the looks of the room we were given."
2.5,2,Stayed here with the family on valentines day because EVERYWHERE was sold out. This place is one step above a rent by the hour motel. Our comforter smelled so bad I had to put it in the closet and close the door.  I didn't like how the hotel building was separate from the casino/ restaurants. Unless your in our situation and your option is to sleep in the car or stay here DONT stay here. I would recommend a station casino if you're staying off the strip. The only reason they got 2 stars was because the steak and eggs breakfast was sooo good and such a good deal.
2.5,5,"Had a little hiccup with a dining over charge & I commented on the survey received. Guess what! within 24 hours I received a call and the Buffet Manager Debbie L. contacted me. We resolved the charge over the phone and were invited back for a VIP treatment at the Buffet.
I am pleased to let otter patrons know that Arizona Charlie's does care and takes pride in providing the best customer service.. 

BY the way, I received another follow up from Ron C. the Catering manager to make sure all was good."
2.5,3,"Needed an inexpensive but decent place to stay for the weekend of EDC.

Our hotel room was simple and clean. The large living/dining room was spacious with just enough furniture for two. The furniture was somewhat scratchy and outdated though but I wasn't expecting much. The bedroom was big enough for a queen sized bed and a TV, although the mattress did not fit the bed frame very well. Sheets were clean, no bed bugs. Bathroom/bathtub all clean, no mold or cracks. The entire time we kept the AC at a 60 because temps were around 120 the entire time we were there. Basic wifi is free for up to 3 devices. If you want faster internet, its about $10 per day per device.

Service was fine. Everyone we encountered was friendly. We ate at the restaurants located inside the casino. They're cheap but the food was good enough to satisfy your hunger. Plus there are great Mexican places nearby to eat at. Location wise, this worked pretty well because it was away from the strip (wanted to avoid it during this trip) but super close getting to the venue for EDC. Security patrols the entire lot for most of the day because the casino's open 24hrs. The 2 ice machines near building 6 & 8 were not working at all times so there was no ice during the hottest times of the day (or for most of the days)."
2.5,2,"Well for me Arizona Charlie's was a little difficult to find because for some reason the GPS just kept falling off in this neighborhood of Las Vegas. The facility itself is really dirty on the outside and clunky. You almost feel like you're in the ghetto. As you leave the parking lot and come up to the registration desk it feels like an unsafe place. People at the front desk were were nice and helpful. The room was well just barely okay. The internet is 12 bucks per day per device. Not good for my taste. I slept well however I must say I sleep well everywhere. Yes, there were people outside yes they were talking loudly and yes it didn't bother me because I went to sleep. For those who sleep lighter this would have been very distressing. There's an acute lack of plugs for anything. I guess I'll say who cares I just checked in and went to sleep and got up and left. Off to find another hotel for the next night. Another Adventure in hotels, I will not repeat."
2.5,4,"Had to be in Vegas for four days attending a trade show.  All of the hotels on the strip were sky high because it was a busy week.  Fifteen minutes east by car is Arizona Charlie's charging very reasonable rates.  Booked a double room which was clean and quiet and only about fifty feet from where I parked the car (try that on the strip!).  I was very happy with the room and will not hesitate to stay again.

The hotel/casino struck me as being very ""Old Vegas.""  I started visiting the strip in the 70's and the hotels and casinos were much as AC is today.  For me, that is a good thing.  Inexpensive meals and buffets (of the non-fancy variety) complete the comparison to the ""good old days.""

For those who want to save on room costs or who want to re-live what things used to be like in Vegas, I heartily recommend Arizona Charlie's."
2.5,5,This is my first time here. Usually I'm drawn to hotels on the strip however I found a good deal at Arizona Charlie's so thought I would give it a try. I'm happy with my choice and Claudia's customer service at the Hotel Front Desk was exceptional.
2.5,5,From Los Angeles and was here for Christmas. I did not feel like paying for resort fees or dealing with traffic. The receptionist  was super nice. Our stay was very clean and the rooms great  to stay in. I got  2 nights for $100 which was great!
2.5,5,"I prescheduled a post wedding dinner on April 6, 2014 for 24 guests at the Yukon Grille located within Arizona Charlie's Boulder Casino.  Some of the reviews suggested that it is located in an unsavory area of Las Vegas but our entire group found it quite acceptable.

A quick walk through the casino took us to the restaurant on the second floor.  I had read that you should not prejudge the Yukon but wait until you had experienced it for yourself.  Those reviews were ""spot on.""   It boasts an elegant, quiet, subdued atmosphere with an extremely competent and friendly staff.  Our visit was pre-coordinated with Debbi Lewis, their Food & Beverage Director.  She greeted us when we arrived and had two large tables waiting for us.  She kept close eye on us the whole evening to ensure that we were enjoying ourselves and that we received everything we ordered.  

Tom was our very knowledgeable and friendly waiter with assistance from a young lady.  (I was negligent and forgot to get her name).  The food was perfect and instead of delivering individual meals they used a two tier cart to deliver our soups, salads, and entrees to everyone at the same time.

I am a very picky person (my wife says ""an anal retentive perfectionist"") so I want everything to be right.  To go a step further, if I go to a restaurant and their restroom is not top notch, clean and well kept I usually do not go back.  I feel that this is an indication of how the restaurant management attends to detail and feels about their guests' total experience.  The Yukon restrooms were excellent to the point of being elegant.  Since I selected this restaurant for 11 of our family members and 13 of the bride's family (whom we had never met) I wanted this evening to go perfectly.  Debbi and Tom made sure of that.  

The thing I dreaded most, after setting this up, was the post meal plebeian ritual of everyone putting in 80% of what they think they owe and the sap who collects the monies (ME) gets to pay the shortage out if his own pocket.  To eliminate this hassle Debbi offered, and provided, separate checks.

Last but not least Debbi scheduled taxis for our return trip to our hotel.  Some of us were parties of five so Debbi had to make sure that the taxi dispatcher sent vans and not cars.

I know this has been a long review but when I am the recipient of an ""over the top"" experience I like to reward those who provided it.

If those who rated the Yukon anything less than 5 stars they should check the sign on the door because they were NOT at the Yukon."
2.5,4,"We had a great time here. The restaurant on the second floor had the cheapest steak and eggs in town and the strawberry shortcake special was outstanding. Don't miss out on eating here, you will love it. Also the casino is good, they gave us cash back up to 100 dollars of losses on slots the same day. I don't think I have ever seen this before, it was very convenient. I didn't stay at the hotel but we had a great time here and I would recommend stopping by for a bite to eat and some risk free slot gaming."
2.5,1,"This place is ghetto and old . The establishment hasn't made upgrades in years. I didn't even feel safe in the hotel. I had the supposedly sweet.  There was nothing sweet about this room . The furniture looked like it was from the 80's.  It was so bad , I called hotels.com and asked for a refund ASAP ! My advice to anyone , do not book here. If the strip is kinda pricey , book at the Hilton at Henderson !"
2.5,1,"This hotel is so old outdated that's why it never makes big incomes, if this hotel owner was smart enough to remodel it and make it more modern style and nice new beds and floors and new restrooms then this hotel would make triple the ammount of income the nicer the hotel the more the guest it's common sense get this hotel updated or we will never return again please remodel asap to have our group of tour buses to bring you guests."
2.5,4,"This place is low priced. There was no resort fee, so the price on orbitz.com for my two night stay came out to $53.00 and change with tax.

It's not like many other places that entice you with the  low price in vegas, then in very fine print state a mandatory resort fee or internet fee must be paid upon arrival. (That is what happened during my last stay in vegas at one of the ""Station"" resorts, my resort fee was more than the actual room cost!)

The place is laid out somewhat weird, the hotel rooms are located behind the parking garage in what looks like a run down housing project. Don't let the exterior fool you, the inside was about as clean and maintained as a more expensive place. The notepad next to the phone (which came complete with some else's math equations) indicate that it may be owned or operated by the same people as the stratosphere.

If you are in Vegas for work, and not fun, it is a convenient place to stay, as you don't have to walk a mile to get to your vehicle. If you have a work truck of some sort, you can probably park close enough to see it from your room.

I booked the room with a single king bed, but was placed in a room with two full size beds....not a big deal for me...


(edited review on 07-04-12, to change ""palace"" to ""station"" as I don't want anyone to think I was referring to Caesar's Palace. I also didn't want to mention the name of the other place, as this review is not about that place, but I guess I just did!)"
2.5,5,Really like most of the bartenders here. Very friendly and you don't have to wait long for a drink.  Not like some casinos.
2.5,2,"Hotel Review:
Location is off the strip on Boulder highway. I had a convention at Sam's town and this was a cheaper hotel. Location is within a mile of Sam's town, but the neighborhood was a little dicey. The back rooms are next to a trailer park and a 711 which makes the element not so great. In the hotels defense they did have security cameras and bike patrols in the area. Was last here in 2006 and was better then. Hotel rooms need a major renovation. Rooms were as clean as expected but so old you could only do so much. My non smoking room was only a suggestion I suppose and the 19"" tube tv was vintage to say the least.
Pros: price , decent coffee shop in casino, no resort fee, parking close to rooms, staff is nice.
Cons: old stale smelling rooms, 19""tube tv, dicey neighborhood, rooms far from casino, rooms are like a motel 6"
2.5,1,"What a nasty place. First thing I noticed was the nasty air when I got off the elevator.(I am healthy and have no breathing problems...I have been congested for three hours. I am not asthmatic or have any bronchial diseases...I hope I don't get it now!) Too much stale cigarette air. My wife was afraid to eat anything in the buffet. The gravy was 'crusty' from sitting too long. The salad dressing had a 'skin' (like dried milk or latex paint). Reminded me of an old run down retirement home. If this were the first impression someone got of VEGAS...it would be the last. Truly, just a nasty place."
2.5,5,"I had stayed at the other Arizona Charlie's location on Decatur on my very first trip to Vegas back in 2004, and it was great, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with the Boulder location. I am a member of the players club, which covers both Arizona Charlie's locations as well as the Stratosphere, and responded to a direct offer I had received from them which gave me an upgraded suite for the price of a standard room.

Check-in was very rapid, and I was especially appreciative of the check-in clerk.  I was having a problem with my debit card at the moment - it turned out the company had put a temporary block on it for suspicion of identity theft!  Fortunately, I got it all straightened out, and the front desk clerk swiped that card about 10 different times over the course of an hour without even frowning. That takes alot of patience - you don't often see much of that in the customer service industry anymore. Thanks again!

The property differs slightly from the Decatur location, as all of the corridors and buildings are outside vs. being enclosed. The decor of the rooms is a little more Mediterranean vs. Southwestern, as the Decatur location is. The suite (I believe it was a Standard King Suite) was very spacious, two televisions, extra cold air conditioner, very good water pressure, and lots of closet space.  The bathroom was a bit small, but no complaints.  This property was originally built as a group of extended stay suites that wound up going bankrupt, which might be one of the reasons the rooms are so big, and come with a good value.

The pool and hot tub area was small, but more than adequate, and not crowded at all.

The casino was great as always - lots of the newer multiline penny machines, but unfortunately, almost no old-skool 3 reels.  The Sourdough Cafe was teriffic. Be sure to check out the Steak and Egg special, it's one of the best, and has won several awards in Las Vegas magazines.  

One thing to make note of is that this particular neighborhood is not the most glamourous - you'll see alot of drug dealing and prostitution from here to the Budget Suites a couple of blocks down the road.  However, I can't fault the hotel for this.

Overall, a teriffic stay and I'd recommend it to everyone. Remember, you won't get the glitz and glamour of the Strip in some of these off-strip casino hotels, but it's been proven that places like these are far superior in customer service and higher casino payouts. The room prices and friendly employees can't be beat. Give it a try!"
2.5,5,"Family came to visit and we took them to the evening buffet at $12. For the 1st time since moving here 3 years ago we had an excellent Prime Rib. We have tried some of the fancy prime rib places where they cut you a  piece not much thicker than the knife that cut it. Here at Arizona Charlies the server wanted to cut me a TOO large piece that I couldn't have been able to eat. Both my wife and I said ""real prime not good level prime"" and enjoyed it. And I'm not crazy their Seaweed at the salad counter is one of the best tasting strange foods that I have ever eaten with maybe Thai spices and sweetness mixed into it. It is also the only buffet where the cook will fry you fresh French Fries and cook you a hamburger to your taste and not burn it to death as the other buffets do."
2.5,1,I'm rating this place no star! Save your money and go somewhere else. My room wasn't clean well. The wifi sucks! I had to go to library to complete my work. Disgusting and full of smokes! Rude waitresses. I will never come here again.
2.5,3,"The place is everything I'd expect from an old Las Vegas Hotel. Good Price, moderate accommodations.

The area is like any other part of Las Vegas off the strip. Weird people walking around, but not crowded.

The room was clearly not designed for their current furniture layout. There was an entire wall empty that left a big void in the room. The room was big enough for a bunch of people to hang out or if you're room sharing for an event. It was decided in two with a for between the bedroom and living room kind of space. The room is dark with the lights on and the windows closed, but fine if you keep the windows open. I prefer the windows closed when I'm changing and getting ready in the morning, however. 

The casino was typical, I guess. I'm not a gambler, but the thousands of slot machines looked the same as every other casino. I don't know if they have table games.  It smelled like smoke when you walk in. It's ok I guess. You get used to it.

The restaurants are ok. I bought one of their specials for $5 burger and fries from the cafe. I've had better for $5, but it's an ok price for a quick bite on a budget. The party was thin and the burger had no special flavor. The fries were very standard and typical too. They needed some salt.

The service was friendly. Front desk check in took about a 10 minute wait with a 5 minute process. I called the operator from my room and she greeted me courteously by name with a quick answer to my question."
2.5,4,Went to Monster cup supercross at Sam Boyd stadium. Perfect for the event about a 6 minute drive. Hotel was clean my room was very nice. Hotel staff was friendly and spoke very clear english.  Prices were very reasonable.  I gave 3 stars only because no food room service. Love the idea too that the casino was not attached to the hotel. It was more like a apt. complex.
2.5,1,"I had booked the hotel for my dad who was visiting for the weekend. I didnt find out till later that my dad didnt have a credit card to leave the incidentals deposit per the hotel policy so my dad was a little upset and was trying to find a solution. The front desk person, Lacarra (?), was whom he dealt with. I was not there to witness the conversation between her and my dad, but I did speak to her over the phone to figure out a solution. She was extremely rude. I told her that all I wanted to do was find a way to fix this situation and I asked politely to speak to her manager. She told me that he wasnt there and he would say the same thing anyway. She started raising her voice and basically telling me I was wrong and there's nothing to be done except her way. I then told her that she needs to be a little nicer because I was being calm and nice to her and I expect her to do the same. She then gave the phone back to my dad, not wanting to talk to me. Later on, I went down to the hotel on my lunch break. I stayed nice and calm. Lacarra was there, didnt really pay much attention to me and had us wait an hour to check in. She went around a corner and I could hear her talking about my dad. It was very uncomfortable and terrible customer service. I ignored it anyways since I was told by Hotwire I could not get any type of change to my reservation and no refund. Overall, according to my dad, the hotel was nice. The front desk costumer service tho, was a nightmare and I will not recommend Arizona Charlie's on Boulder to any of my friends and family. We'll spend a little extra next time. I wish I could give this hotel a zero star rating."
2.5,1,Arizona charlies is dirty and disgusting. The buffet and coffee shop and steakhouse all suck. The place is filthy and smells. It's all garbage people that go there and there is no class there. That place is for white trash people and should be imploded.
2.5,3,"RV PARK, has a separate entrance.
WiFi.  Pets cannot be over 35 lbs. NOT for us. $32/ night.
$180/ week pull thru.
Cost is up to $650 a month, including utilities. add 12% tax."
2.5,4,"This place was pretty good. My husband and I got a king suite and we were not disappointed. 
pros: clean room, friendly staff, lot of space and off the strip so quite peaceful.
cons: you have to pay extra for the internet and if you want a fridge (unless its for meds) and the cable was so limited it was pretty much all news. 

all in all though I give arizona charlies a 4 out of 5. I would absolutely staay here again and would recommend it to anyone."
2.5,1,"1 star is too much but since i have to put a star they get it by default.. This place is FILTY ! It is outdated, no wifi, rooms arent properly cleaned. We literally showered with shoes on and didnt want to sit down. We showered and checked out it isnt worth the stay at all SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE. Motel 6 would be better than here FORSURE!"
2.5,1,"Ok price.Old tv sets, poor cable channel selection.Hustlers for sex and loose change in the casino and parking lots. Seedy neighborhood. Casino smells of cigarette smoke. Dirty bar/lounge. Rude front desk staff.Homeless man took a bath in the hot tub one night."
2.5,2,Decent. Yet their stricter than at legit casinos? That's just mediocre I'm not coming here again but I was visiting my dad. I much prefer the strip and I will always  stick to them. Maybe if the rules  were  explained to us the first time we were addressed we would have listened but all they did was yell. Please save your time and money
2.5,1,Do not stay here! I found a junkies needle jammed into my bed of their delux room. Very ghetto I checked in and checkout within an hour. Very seedy and lots of scary people.
2.5,1,"Upon arriving we were greeted by very helpful and friendly staff... That's where our good experience ended at Arizona Charlie's Boulder. As we walked in our room we were greeted with the WORST mildew smell I have ever encountered. It smelled like the carpet was soaked with the juices of a homeless person and never dried. For a cheap hotel we didn't expect much so we sprayed some air freshener and gave it another chance. We woke up the next morning to find that the bathroom light doesn't work... I am currently sitting on the toilet writing this review... In the dark. So yeah, if you're thinking about staying here... Just spend the extra money and go to a better place, or sleep on the street. It smells better."
2.5,1,"Disgusting. Our couch had a huge stain on it. The carpet was beyond filthy. Something was smeared all over the bathroom and vanity room walls, either blood, makeup or who knows what.  I would not sit on the furniture and did not pull back sheets to sleep.  They offered another room that was as bad if not worse.  We were stuck as we had been staying at a great hotel on the strip since Monday but needed to extend one day and due to several conferences we were forced to relocate.  Frankly I was horrified.  NEVER AGAIN.  Further, the entire place had a very unsettling feel to it."
2.5,3,"Three stars for cleanliness, good mattress and nice employees, but everything else is not so great. 
1) crowded, confusing casino with no signage to hotel registration desk (and they have 301 rooms, all full).  But employees are friendly, ask for directions)
2) only 1 check in clerk at 8 pm. Bus was unloading and there were lots of guests around. 
3) players card only gave 10% off for new signees - no free meals. But Tues is BOGO free buffet
4) put on 3rd floor of remote building (is arranged like motel buildings around central park and pool) but elevator was broken
5) grounds and pool well maintained and attractive. Pool looks clean. We had a nice view of it. 
6) paid for ""suite.""  Had huge front room with hide-a-bed couch and tv. Furniture sparse and old and budget. 
7) small bedroom barely fit king size bed with tv
8) sink was one of the nightstands right next to my pillow. 
9) dark walk in closet. 
10) most important:  CLEAN. Even crevices around tub and on bathroom floor. Kudos. 
11) surprise: mattress, pad and bedding looked brand new (I always check for bedbugs - even in 4-star hotels)
If you need fancy, this is not your place (we won't stay again, too depressing). But I can vouch for our room which was clean."
2.5,1,"I cannot give Arizona Charlie's Hotel less than a single star, and they only deserve that single star for the upstanding front desk staff who handled the issues with grace and professionalism.
My husband and I checked in about 2AM October 31, it was the beginning of our anniversary.  We live locally, but wanted our anniversary away from home and our kids, just to have our special day together.  We had just seen a great tribute concert and a small venue and headed to Arizona Charlie's to turn in for the night.  We already had a reservation for the following night, but asked the desk clerk if we could add this night on.  She checked, and yes our room was available, she made the adjustments and as she did, we chatted about this was our anniversary, we had just seen a fabulous concert, and how I had a bad headache because I wasn't used to the loudness I experienced.  She offered there was a 7-11 next door where I could get some Ibuprofen if I needed, but I said I just need to rest a bit in some quiet.
My husband went to go play a few slots while I went up to our room to lie down.  As soon as I entered the room, I was appalled.  Sure it was a smoking room, but it smelled like the room had been on fire or that the windows had never been opened.  I turned on lights and the carpets were stained and dirty, like not even vacuumed dirty, I could see things left behind on the carpet.  This was a small suite, so there was a ""living room""  with a couch, chair, and dining table.  The remote for the TV had NO batteries in it, so could not turn on the living room TV and had some unknown stuff all over it.  The curtains were torn and stained, the window sill had stains and wallpaper was peeling in places.
Enter the bedroom, the bedding looked clean and well made, more carpet stains and evidence of poor vacuuming.  The air vent cover was off and leaning against the TV stand, the remote for this one had batteries but no cover over them, and there's a little sign that says wifi is $11.99 per day.  The closet has more carpet stains and damage, the hangers are dirt, you can see old dirt and hair on them and dead bugs and dirt inside the light globe.  The bathroom looked clean with a couple clean towels, but the toilet had issues flushing.
I text my husband this room is gross but I need to lie down.  I talked to the manager first thing in the morning, explained and showed pictures and she was shocked.  We were refunded immediately with mountains of apologies and promises there will be a housekeeping overhaul and some remodeling of rooms in this condition.
I won't stay in the hotel again, no matter if we are first stay after a remodel or not, that was just pure gross.  The casino and restaurants were lovely though."
2.5,2,We went in for the steak and shrimp advertisement that was posted outside but it was so smoky we couldn't even go in and stay. We went upstairs to the buffet it looked ok not very many selections though so after dealing with the smoke and the not so plentiful Buffet we decided to take off
2.5,1,Worst experience ever. Someone broke into my uncles room while he was sleeping. Security knew who it was and didn't catch the guy. My kids were afraid to sleep alone. Staff didn't seem to care to much.  We had quite a few family members staying here cuz there was a death in the family. There was also someone trying to go thru the window of my other uncles room.
2.5,1,"BUGS!!!! YES BED BUGS!!! 
I CALLED THE NEWS STATION. channel 13 in Las Vegas they confirmed there are bed bugs in all of the Hotels. The man even ask ""how I didn't know there were bed bugs in Las Vegas? And said everybody knows. Then mentioned what I wanted him to do?"" I was in shock. After everything We had been thur.
I had such terrible experience in the Arizona Charlies on bolder hwy. I was in a tight situation. My car had broken down . A family friend recommend the Hotel. Clean and great value. So I booked Sunday night on one debit card, not knowing when my car would be repaired. The next day one of us got bit on the arm. We didn't thing nothing of it at first. Monday I found out my engine had to be taken appart. So when I got to the hotel I extended my stay till friday. On another debit card and ask the to put all the charges on the new card including sundays. Well no they could not do that correctly because they over chatged voth credit cards. Put to depoists hold on both cards. Leaving me short about 100 dollars. We sleeped on one of the beds. In the morning one of us was bit again but this time she caught the bug. And we call the front desk. Almost instantly they upgraded us a suite. The next morning we were bit  up all of us were covered in bed bug bits. At this point we checked out right away. This ruin my vacation!!
I called to complain about a refund. WAIT ON A RISK MANAGEMENT TO CALL BACK. I WILL NEVER STAY IN ANY HOTELS IN VEGAS."
2.5,1,"If you are thinking about staying here, don't do it! Dirty. We checked in late, and the main light bulb was burned out. I called in the morning and when they changed it I almost wished they hadn't. We could now see the dirty red/brown splatter marks on the walls, and the white splatters on the wall that you could only hope was a snotty booger. It looked like there was a bullet hole in one of the walls. The tv remote was sticky and grimy. The light switch in the bathroom was so dirty it makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. Then you think at least they have a pool you can escape too, think again. The pool water was so cloudy, you couldn't see the bottom of the shallow end, not to mention my flip flops stuck to the pool deck with ever step because it was so grimy and gross. If you don't have to, don't stay here."
2.5,2,"It's partially my fault for selecting AC. We booked a last minute trip, and everything else was ridiculously overpriced for a hotel with a casino. For a Saturday night, we ended up paying $71.

First of all for you young folks, no young, sexy people stay here. If you want that, you'll have to cough up some dough and book elsewhere. Its mostly older folks and families. Maybe its my own fault for hanging out with people who work part time menial jobs with low pay. The cheapest rooms are OLD. No other way to describe it! They are old with a 9 inch box TV. No exaggeration. The walls are very thin, you can hear everything the neighbors next to you and on top of you are doing. 

I did like that the room was at least clean, the shower and toilet worked properly, and the beds were comfortable. The rooms are separate from the casino, so if tobacco smoke bugs you that's a plus. The walk to you room from the parking is very close as well. The food is good, especially for the price ,it is a bargain. Get yourself a free rewards card and you'll get 10% off food. $3 Blackjack helps pass time as well.

I probably wouldn't stay here again. I wouldn't rule it out, but its highly unlikely, especially if I visit for pleasure.
--------------------------

I forgot to mention that the staff is friendly and professional."
2.5,1,"This place is so dirty and gross!!! Do not stay here!!!! Rooms are nasty, carpet is stained, stains all over walls of who knows what, I didnt even want to sleep on the bed or sit on the toliet. Not a good area of town, lots of sketchy people hanging around the property. I wouldnt even give this place one star."
2.5,3,"This is the 3rd and final update, after finally getting ahold of management and talking with them today they decided to comp my room costs for one night.. I thank them for that, the room besides the issues I had on my stay were decent and if you're looking for a cheap place.. go to motel 6 or something like that.

------------





The 2 star review just became a 1 star... like noted my first day was an absolute hell here and I've been nervous since and even had a nightmare. The first day I got here and kindly told the front desk lady that I had recently had ankle surgery and couldn't walk far. She said she understood and would get me one of the closest rooms. 

After getting my room number I went to go to my room, when I inserted my key it didn't work. I figured maybe I had a bad key so I tried both and neither worked. I called the front desk to contacted security and security told me that the front desk wrote down the wrong building and room number.

After finding the right room I went in and put my stuff on one of the beds and went to use the restroom since I had just been on the road for a couple hours. I went into the bathroom and after using the toilet I noticed blood on the ground under the toilet and right against the wall.. this absolutely freaked me out as blood can carry disease. I called the front desk and told them and they said they would send someone to meet me at my ""upgraded"" room.

One final update.. I went back to my orginal booking email and I had a double room with double beds.. why did they try to put me in a normal 1 room 2 bed room? 

They claimed I was upgraded when I got the room I was supposed to have in the first place?????

So after going to my upgraded room and standing outside for 15 minute an security guard showed up and said oh I thought you'd still be at the other room. After this he let me in and went our seperate ways. 

I once again put my stuff on the bed and went to Walmart when my friend as soon as he had gotten to my room. We went and enjoyed some in-n out and got some drinks and food at walmart, about 3 hours later we got back and I went to use the bathroom to only find the toilet clogged with used toilet paper and an handle that was ""loose""..

I've only been able speak to the front desk and never have been able to contact a manager. The front desk however said that the manager they've contacted at home would be happy to give me $10 off my total purchase.... Seriously? I seen blood and now even had nightmare about it.. not to mention someone else's toilet paper and a clogged toilet isn't what I paid for. 

The staff for the most part are friendly but it seems you'll never get a hold of an manager like I said I could've on friday.. seems they just never show up.."
2.5,2,"Still a fan, but I can't in good conscience rate this place any better than two stars.

Someone asked me what Arizona Charlie's was like.  I replied, well, do you like camping?  Because staying here is a lot like camping.  It's a step up from camping, but it's a very small step up.

My king suite (3705) isn't the worst room I've stayed in during my frequent visits to Las Vegas (that dubious distinction is held by the Palace Station ""courtyard rooms""), but it is in the running.  

I've stayed here many times.  I chose this place because the room rates are low and they don't charge a resort fee.  I can look past the fact they don't have free wifi like next door at the Eastside Cannery.  It doesn't bother me that the rooms typically have stains and burn marks on nearly every surface that can be stained or burned.  I can even look past the fact that one visit a couple years ago I woke up covered in bedbug bites.  I understand that can happen anywhere, even at high end places.  I educated myself on bedbugs and now I thoroughly, meticulously, inspect the room before I unpack.  I don't mind the remote location, far away from most tourist attractions.  I rather like the east side of town.

The biggest problem I encountered on this visit was the underpowered air conditioner.  The lowest setting was 60 degrees but even leaving it on 24 hours a day, all week long, the suite never felt cool.  It didn't help that the air conditioning unit was in the living room, not the bedroom of the suite.  

Another, and ongoing,  issue I have is with the front desk.  When I walk up to check in I make sure I have on my biggest smile.  I've worked in customer service and I know what a drag it is to deal with the  public sometimes, so I really try to be as charming and polite as I can possibly be whenever I check in anywhere I stay.  I do this not because I'm looking for an upgrade, or special accommodations.  Usually the desk clerk will mirror my attitude and we'll share a few laughs and my stay is starting off on a pleasant note.

But a fat lot of good it does here.  Time after time when I check in here I am amazed how ill received I am.  When I first started staying here ten years ago, they would always let me check in early if there was a room available.  There was always a room available.  For the last two years they refuse to even check availability, they just say come back at 3:00.  Not with a smile, not with the slightest apology.  Just a smirk and a like it or lump it attitude. 

It's such a stupid policy.  I'm ready to spend money and you won't let me check in.  Instead of being able to unload my car, take a shower and get ready to play, I have to find something to do for a couple hours.  Since they started this no early check in policy I have completely refused to gamble here.  I'd rather spend my gambling dollars where my business is appreciated.  

On a positive note, I am happy to see they finally upgraded the TVs.  They still have a pathetically meagre selection of TV channels, but at least the TVs are modern flat screens now.

I know I'll be back because Arizona Charlie's has competitive room rates and no resort fee.  But I will never stay here again in the summer.  I need a room with an air conditioner that actually cools the room.  

Mikey C says: it's like camping, but indoors!"
2.5,1,The grave yard manager Donna was not only unprofessional but arrogant and rude.  She shouldn't be greeting guest with her horrible attitude.  I would tell you to run the opposite way.  Poor customer service and no one could resolve an issue.
2.5,1,Wow ! What could I say about this place. I made my reservation here after I heard about the incident at the other Arizona Charlie's in Decatur and that was a big mistake. We got the room and the carpets were filthy . We had two beds and we noticed that they didn't have a top blanket like a comforter or Bedspread we called the front desk and they said the rooms don't come with it. That's crazy. The website pictures shows it. The customer service was terrible.  They bathtub made an awful cracking sound it was room 3509 We will not be staying here anymore.
2.5,4,The breakfast buffet offers a good selection and is reasonably priced. The service this morning was excellent. I go here 3 to 4 times a month and will continue. Omlettes and eggs cooked to order and fresh made waffles. Under $7.00.
2.5,5,"The Thanksgiving buffet was very nice. I asked for dark meat and got a whole Turkey leg. I thought I was 12 again and back home as my mother favored me and I got a leg every year. As we eat here every week after giving up on all the Station buffets, the buffet at Eastside and mostly at Sam's Town. 
  Why is it that a small casino has the best tasting food AND the lowest price of all the local casinos? They try harder plus they now have seaweed. Yes seaweed that is flavored with Thai spices only a tiny bit of heat and slightly more sweet. Seaweed is the best tasting item on the salad table and by the way I'm Irish American."
2.5,5,"We hadn't been there in a while, the food wasn't that great but my family and I went last Friday, had the steak and egg special 4.99. It was delicious.  We will definitely go back and for the price you cant beat it!! If you haven't been there you got to go!!!"
2.5,1,I'm only giving it a 1 star because I can't give it a zero. The buffet was half empty and their servers weren't clearing empty tables to get people seated. We stood for almost 20 minutes waiting for a table in an almost empty buffet. When the staff was asked about it they just shrugged their shoulders and didn't even try to hurry. Absolutely ridiculous!! Avoid this place at all costs!!
2.5,1,"This place is awful! We checked in immediately wanted to leave. The room was gross. Dirty carpets, nasty bathtubs, a toilet that barely flushed, etc. Customer service is definitely lacking. We will not be returning."
2.5,1,"We checked in....AC did not work efficiently, it was 110 outside, rugs and sofa stained. It was not a pleasant room...Staff was pleasant,  we decided not to stay and I expect there will be no charge my card.

7/11/17..... Credit card statement came today and guess what they CHARGED me!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could take away the one star I gave them....SO ANGRY.... called my CC company to dispute"
2.5,1,"Avoid at all costs!!!
I would like to point out that I grew up in a family that worked in the service industry (I was even a busboy at the age of 12) so I am very sympathetic when things don't always go as planned when dealing with any service industry. But this time I have to come out ""Guns a Blazing"" to help you avoid this dump. 

1. Family Friendly: I would say NOT!!! We went as a group; 10 families for a softball tournament in Las Vegas. We were told we had to stay in this hotel otherwise we could not be in the tournament. (Letter of complaint to the ASA Las Vegas Tourney's on the way). This place is not kid friendly or even family friendly at all. The only location to go as a group to is the swimming pool. Even though you're as quiet as a ghost, security show's up to kick you out of the pool area promptly at 10:00pm. There is no other location for families (groups) to mingle unless you want to go to the smoke filled casino.

2. Room's: Bring your own cleaning supplies and leave the kids outside while you clean the room. The rooms were non-smoking and didn't have the dingy stale smoke smell many converted rooms had. We were in building #3 room 2312 and the floor (carpet) was filthy and in need of carpet replacement badly. The Bathroom needed a deep cleaning in all areas. The rooms in my building was actually two rooms a living area with twin size bed that sat 3 feet off the floor and the master room with a queen size bed right up against the sink....Yes I said ""sink"" that was in the master bedroom. It turns out that the bathroom is so small that they couldn't fit a sink in it, so they put the sink up against bed. So if your laying in the bed and it's time for someone to brush their teeth, your getting a shower. The windows in our room were so filthy you could barely see through it. The lighting in the room is very bad, so during the day you open the curtains for a little light and all you see is dried pigeon poop on the outside of the window. Not all the windows for all rooms were this bad...just mine, probably because it took a ladder to get to our second floor window and no one is that motivated. For some reason the TV in the living area was a tiny 22"" tube television and in the master bedroom the TV was bigger...don't ask me why???
The room air conditioner is seriously old school. There's a hole cut through the wall from the living area into the master bedroom with a pipe stuck through that comes out directly behind the TV in the Master Bedroom for ventilation. This thing is ""LOUD"" and rattles like a fright train. If it wasn't for 10 years of sleeping on an Aircraft Carrier, I would have gotten no sleep at all. Yes...I slept in the living area where the air conditioner is because my kids couldn't see the 22"" television or hear it because of the air conditioner. 

3. Exterior of building: They use natural earth tones to paint the building...but I can tell you it's been many, many years since they painted it. Every wall in every location has black scuff marks everywhere you look. It's like they had fifty 7 year old's pumped up on pop rocks and cola riding bicycles without training wheels for the first time. 

4. Pool: The pool is too small for the amount of people Arizona Charlie's can handle. I already told you they shut the pool down promptly without question (no one was even swimming in the pool). The first day we were there the pool needed a good skimming, but the second day when all the softball teams had arrived, they had to shut down the pool because the water became very cloudy. They drained half of it and then refilled it...it still look cloudy so we went to a friends hotel and used their pool. 

5. Casino: Your everyday locals smoke filled casino. Crowd was mostly over 65 and lived nearby. I did have one of our parents win $1,000 at the black jack table on a side bet...but it took her 30 minutes to collect her money because the pit boss didn't know how to make the payout. All the pit boss could say was: ""no one has ever won that side bet before.""

6. Restaurant: We ate one night at the restaurant (I don't remember the name). They were running a $15.00 dinner special we tried it and it was okay, nothing overly fancy and the food wasn't special at all. I will say that Tommy our server did an exceptional job and we really enjoyed his service. When my wife's seafood plate came out well overcooked like sole of boot when she asked for rare, he had no problem letting her switch to the beef dinner special. Tommy was great!!! the food was just okay. 
We didn't eat in the Buffet, even though I was looking forward to trying the breakfast there. Prices were fair $5.95 for breakfast buffet (with players club card) but one of the parents put a bad taste in my mouth when she said; ""Look how they clean our rooms, are you going to trust them to cook your food also?"" Needless to say we went to Denny's for breakfast and I never saw the buffet line the whole time we were there."
2.5,3,"Walked in at 3:45 with a big smile.  I had already been to Mr Mamas and had a great lunch.  Followed that up with a flat out fantastic massage at Best Foot Spa.  Best Foot Spa is right close to Lee's Liquor.  By the time I got to Arizona Charlie's I was set.  I was feelin' good.  Very good.

Check in was pleasant.  Major improvement at the Registration Desk!  It was such a welcome change from my last several visits, it put an even bigger smile on my face.  

My King suite was a smoking room, so as soon as I sat my bags down I immediately started smoking.  I smoked and I smoked and I smoked.  It took a while, but soon I had a really good cloud going in the room.  I mean, it was so smoky it was difficult to see the big ass TV through the haze.  Clearly, there are few responsibilities as a hotel guest I take more seriously than my obligation to keep my smoking room smoky.

You smoke like that you gonna get hungry.  And that's exactly what happened.  But damn, by now I'm in NO condition to drive anywhere.  And I had a really good smoke going on.  I didn't want to be away from the room so long I'd lose the smoky momentum I had going.   As I always do in such cases, I lit a small fire in the wastebasket and then poured just enough water on it to put out the flames.  I sat the smoldering wastebasket in the bathtub and waited until the suite was completely filled with smoke.  That would buy me at least an hour or so.  

I needed a quick meal, so Arizona Charlie's coffee shop, the Sourdough Cafe, was out of the question.  They're not quick.  I decided to try the little deli tucked away in the back corner of the casino.  Turned out to be a good choice.  The cheesesteak I had was pretty dang good.  And it was ready quickly!  There was still plenty of smoke in the room when I got back.

I like to think that when I checked out three days later I had made some real progress on the smokiness of the suite.  There's a lot to do in Las Vegas and I ended up spending a lot of time outside of the room.  Still, I know I left Arizona Charlie's a little smokier than I found it.  I'm good with that.

Mikey C says: where there's smoke...."
2.5,1,"Where to start with this place...

If you're looking for something DIRT CHEAP... This is not the place to go, because frankly, for the price you get here, you can find better places closer to the strip, if that's what you're after.
Now, I actually got to stay there for free but I'm still going to nit-pick everything for your convenience. 

1. Site said they're pet friendly, so we brought our small dog. Pretty much the deciding factor why we chose it... When we arrived at about 5am to get our room, we unloaded into the room, and finally bring the dog in. 5 mins later, their little downs syndrome security guard on his bicycle came pounding on our door saying they saw the dog on camera and that we're not allowed to have dogs here... Ugh, wtf? Your site said animal friendly.. So fk you guys! We put the dog in the truck, and surprisingly enough. We were harassed for about 2 hours by their security talking about the dog. They sat in the room above us, and continually circled our truck looking inside? Who the fk do you think you are? Harassing your customers and making them feel like criminals over a damn dog.

2. The rooms are not what the site says. There are no kitchen areas, no fridges.

3. The shower and toilet had a disgusting black residue all over it. Do they even hire cleaning maids?

4. The beds are god awful as far as comfort. At one point I took a pillow and laid on the ground... To my disbelief, the ground smelled like feces... Could this place get any worse? YES IT CAN!

5. During almost every cigarette break I took outside, a hooker either walked by or drove by looking for the room she was called to... So yea, if you're looking to be around that kind of stuff, this is the place to go.

I would give this place 0 stars if possible... They're lucky to even get one... This place is the biggest joke I've ever seen in my life... Frankly, I'd rather stay in a Motel 6 than ever even thinking about this place... Avoid at all costs. Don't even consider. No matter how cheap their rooms are, remember, it's Vegas, there's a hundred places that are just as cheap and better quality."
2.5,5,Me and my friend came into town and stayed here. We couldnt beat the deal we got on expedia including the flight. The room was exceptional. Had a Couch and Bed and Tv in one room. Then the other room had a bed and tv. The buffet isnt the biggest but the price is good. Loved the Cafe and Shortcake and steak was good and a great price. Security roaming around kept things quiet. Not far to the strip. A 7-11 is right around the corner. Played in the Bingo hall and had a blast. Will recommend all to stay here who dont want Strip prices but a great place to lay your head and eat. The pool was fun too.
2.5,1,"Price was excellent, BUT that was it!   Front desk service is horrific, rudest, unprofessional rude individuals that work at the hotel check in desk.   Would rather handle all the phone calls coming in, then the people in front of them.  Rooms aren't that much better, inch of dust behind bedside table, carpet old and stained, bedspread and curtains look like haven't been changed or cleaned in 30 years.  If you want a place for the night or a flop house, as this place looks ok, if you want good service you won't get it here!"
2.5,4,"Doe The price I paid it doesn't get any better, stayed for sema week, and my on problem was cab service because it's far form the strip but bus service is great get use to it and your a winner!"
2.5,1,"This place an absolute crap hole. Yes it's cheap but the rooms are dirty, air conditioning sucks,  and I got a non smoking room that reeks of smoke. No taxi service, called front desk multiple times, and no answer.  Finally walked to the front desk, waited about 10 minutes no one ever came to help me. I will definitely stick to my hotels on Freemont or the strip."
2.5,1,"It took us 20 min from the airport to get here without traffic. The outside looks like any other grungy pink  motel but the inside is bad. I wasn't expecting much for $35 but my sink was clogged, there were toilet stains, and I couldn't tell if the sheets were stained or if that's a pattern. It's kind of far from the strip also. I think their hotel shampoo made my hair more oily. 

Pros
Cheap price. 

Cons
Cheap feel. Horrible lighting. 

Would I come here again? 
No. I'm sure I could find similar priced hotels closer to the strip."
2.5,4,"I really liked this hotel because of its location and price. I just can't give 5 stars for them because this hotel doesn't have free wi fi (they charge you in $12/day). Also, they don't provide microwave and refrigerator in the suites (I am sure that is because they want us to pay for food in their restaurants too) and also because its tooo noisy, I could hear what was happening in the room above. However, I really recommend this hotel because of its location (15 min from strip), cleanliness, organization and service."
2.5,1,"This is the 1st time that the Hubs and I have went to this hotel to stay for 4 days. Unfortunately it wasn't the experience I wanted.  I have never heard of a hotel that charges $11.99 a day per device for Wifi. Are you serious.
The Hubs and I had to print out tickets for a Game we were going to the 1st night we were there, we asked about the Business center only to find out there want one but had this mini little computer to print. We got charged $11.00 to print and use the computer for 3 min.s. 1st strike. 
When we got to the room, the card didn't work. Went back to the front and got new ones. From that point only 1 worked. When we finally got into the room it smelled like if someone had smoked Marijuana and if someone was in their 5 min.s before and had done the dirty. It was a bad smell. Strike 2.
For the 1st 2 Days we didn't have any Hot water. On the 2nd day I went to call the front desk only to not be able to call cause the Phone was broken. I had to walk all the way to the front from the back. I waited 20 .min.s in line to tell the front desk about what happened. They called maintenance and said someone was going to meet there. When he got there the guy told me that they had shut the water off cause they had a issue. WTF no one couldn't tell us that. We didn't have any water for 2 days and you couldn't tell us there was issues. Strike 3.
Than the topping on the cake the day we checked out we needed a few extra minutes to check out ( since it was 11am for check out). Someone came banging on our door ( we had slept in on accident after coming in late from the night before). I tried to call down stairs to the front and NO ONE answered the phone for 45 min.s . When I FINALLY got someone on the phone and woman name Rebecca answered with a nasty adittude and said that she will give us 5 min.s to check out and than hung up on me. I was done.. we packed up everything and went and checked out. I am Officially done with coming here. Never again. 
Warning if you want to come here be prepared for anything but a good experience."
2.5,3,"When I first moved to Vegas a few years ago, I had to wait a few days before I could move into my place.  And, I didn't want to stay at the Budget Motels... for obvious reasons.  So, I looked into hotels near my place and ended up choosing AZ CHUCK'S.  The hotel is not attached to the casino.  It has a small pool, which I didn't use.  The room I stayed in was actually pretty nice.  It was a one bedroom suite and it was quiet.  That is all that I was looking for when I ended up staying here for that time.  The Casino over the years has seen some renovation.  It is a nice little place with its' clientele being an older crowd spending their retirement money.  

They have a couple of restaurants upstairs, The Yukon Grill, Sourdough Cafe, and the Buffet.  Downstairs they have a couple of fast food places.  

My reason for checking into AZ Chuck's was to go to the Sourdough Cafe.  So, you can check out my review there if you like."
2.5,1,"Dump

I was scared for my life, You would be hard pressed to find a place more scary and sketchy in Las Vegas...

I had fun playing Bingo, but when we were leaving, I thought I was going to get shot as a police situation and manhunt was unfolding in the casino as i walk out the door I see two guys urinating in the bushes and one vomiting just steps from the police car... 

My first time playing bingo since I was a kid, if i have to deal with this scene no thanks..."
2.5,1,The only good item on the buffet was the salad bar. The rest of the food had the appearance of mush!  Salmon looked white and watery. Fried Calamari rings looked good but when I tried them there was no calamari just breading. The part of the brisket which wasn't fatty tasted ok. All in all an unappetizing buffet. (The servers were attentive.)
2.5,1,STINKS and SMELLS like a mixture of an old folks home and dirty carpet (before you even get to the door)!!!! Why not change the carpet for once?! This place is nasty and the parking sucks!!!!!@@@
2.5,3,This place offers some of the best room rates anywhere in Las Vegas.  I had to stay in the area for a month and a half so this place really was a fantastic find for that situation.  The casino and food were not very good quality but the room was perfectly decent for the price and MUCH better than anyplace else you would find at their prices.  If I were just coming into town for a quick trip or vacation I would certainly recommend staying at one of the nicer places on or near the strip but for long term or if you need very cheap accommodations this place is fantastic for the price.
2.5,1,"The picture that I took was deceiving. The picture looked edible, but the food was terrible! Literally tasteless, dry, and upsetting to my stomach. I saw the Steak and Eggs Special for $7.77...it was an especially disappointing mistake! The only decent thing was their mediocre cup of coffee. Again, it was regrettable! I went to the restaurant only, not the buffet, and I wasn't staying there, but if the restaurant food is any indication of the overall establishment; I'll pass!
A friend, whom I was treating to breakfast also didn't bother finishing his subpar meal! I was slightly disappointed in myself for falling prey to such deception. Won't be going back!"
2.5,2,"This place has been a nightmare, the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the hotel staff/security is friendly. My first ""room"" I was sent to the wrong building and room. Security informed me the front desk messed up and wrote it wrong. My second room had either dried blood or rat feces on the ground in the bathroom. 

I'm on my 3rd room and this room already had toilet paper in the bowl and was plugged. I asked my buddy if he forgot to flush and he said I didn't even have time to go.. so yeah that's a bit nasty to have someone's used toilet paper already in the bowl... that doesn't flush. 

I can't say I've ever had this much issues with a hotel as much as I stay in them."
2.5,4,"Decent, basic, affordable. I'll admit the previous reviews had me worried, but I gave this place a chance and left relatively satisfied.
We needed a hotel room for EDC weekend. Our days in the room composed of sleeping and getting ready, and that was perfectly fine for me. The rooms were clean, carpet freshly vacuum washed, and the staff were very friendly. You get the basics of a room, nothing more nothing less. 
There's no refrigerator, no safe, low lighting. Saw a bug in the room (bugs exist, plus we were on the first floor). Overall, if you want a basic hotel, I'd say this place is pretty good. I'd come back."
2.5,3,"First time staying away from Fremont or the strip. We went back and forth with here and Sams Town, and picked here cause our friends ended booking their rooms at a pretty decent rate so we joined in. 

The rooms are very basic, but overall clean. I was upset that there was no safe so carrying around all my cash makes me nervous. 

It's a little sketchy outside but no one bothered us.

We didn't eat at any restaurants so can't review on the food. 

Casino was boring and I lost money. 

We went to dinner at sams town our last night and was kind of bummed we didn't stay there when it was only $10 more a night, oh well... I know now."
2.5,1,"This is a disgusting hotel worst experience. They don't clean the rooms at all, based on the huge blood stain we found on the bed. Unfortunately we had kids with us that day and they had to be exposed to this filthy, unsanitary room.  

When the hotel personal was notified they just offer to switch our room and the room they had given us was a room that smelled like cigarette smoke.  After seeing that room and returning to our room, that I had not seen because I was out getting some food, we decided to go back to the front desk. We had taken our food back to the car a soon as my cousin mention the situation he had found in the room and before checking any of the rooms out (unfortunately we would end up eating cold food).

We had to wait over 20 minutes because the lady was on break and no one was there to attend the front desk. Not only did she refuse to give us back our money but didn't seem to believe us about the filthy room. She must have heard the conversation I was having with my cousins wife, about speaking to the corporate office if the lady didn't help us. My cousin was the one speaking to her and she had offer to give us back half the money and put us in the room she had given us, since they don't offer refunds.

She was saying that the room is cleaned and that there couldn't be any blood stain on the bed. That's when I stepped in and said it was dirty that we weren't making this up. That's when she said she was going to refund our money but first she had to send security to check it out make sure we weren't lying.

Waited another 20 mins security came to the room took pictures and left. My cousin came back up 10 mins later and said we had to be out of the room before we get our money back. Security was nice enough to approach us and assumed we had been told to leave the room because of sanitary reason. But unfortunately this wasn't the case, the only reason was to get a refund. That refund was only given because the lady knew I would contact corporate about this unsanitary hotel.  

I would give them a lower star if I could would never recommend this hotel to anyone even if it was the only one available. Which reminds me the lady also wished us luck finding another hotel because they were all booked and it was more of the way she said it like she was hoping we couldn't find another hotel. Not the kind of customer service anyone should experience.

I also took pictures and video of this unsanitary room."
2.5,4,I went with a buddy and thought it would suck but just wanted a place to sleep that's CHEAP. Not bad place at all. Everything was clean. I had a car so didnt mind the drive to attractions and even found stuff on drive I would of never seen if I had stayed on strip. Basically a motel 8. Only disappointment was 11 dollars for wifi per day. My buddy had a ton of data and used his phone as a hot spot so didn't need to. If you just need a place to sleep perfect.
2.5,4,"I rate the hotel and casino 4 stars, however there was a problem I had with one lady who was working on the hotel lobby desk alone (I wish I got her name) but she was very rude and condescending and had awful customer service skills. I mistook the hotel lobby desk as the rewards desk for casino, since I was staying at the hotel. I then mentioned how much it would be to stay another couple of nights since I was at the desk already. Then she said what room I said 1505, she looked at me stupidly and claimed there wasn't a floor 15. I never even claimed there was, she didnt even know how the hotel rooms were labeled by buildings and treated me with a disgusting condescending attitude. I loved the $20 dining credit at Yukon Grille, and the slots were pretty loose. The rest of the staff were great and for the price the room it was also great. However that one employee the woman who was working at the hotel desk alone, shouldn't be working their, her attitude was disgusting."
2.5,3,"Arizona Charlies I have to say we have come here several times over the years to play here as well as go to their restaurants.

The casino is a decent size. Being a local and having a players club card you get specials mailed to you, 

When playing in the casino you do get free drinks, It is considered to be a locals casino because it is so far from the strip.

We have never stayed in the Hotel, I hear the rooms are pretty cheap if you need one. Remember you get what you pay for and if you want to be near the strip this is not close at all and it will take a bit with traffic to get there."
2.5,4,"Stayed there looking for property this weekend.
Right down the street from my son - so I've been here before but not to stay.
Customer service and ease of getting the suite on the first floor was great.
The suite area was very nice - lots of room.
I always bring my slippers because most rooms have that crappy rug and you know people keep their shoes on and bring (stuff) in from the outside, bathrooms, other not so clean...
Price:  great
Noise:  none
Bugs:  none
Bed:  great - hige
TV:  great
Bathroom:  clean and functional
Kitchen:  no mini fridge (that would be nice) 

Overall - 4.5"
2.5,1,"My family decided to take a last minute road trip to Las Vegas. As expected it was extremely hard to find a hotel in one of the busiest cities there are. After a hour of searching, this hotel was the only one available at the last minute. Upon getting there and waiting in a very long line (minding you there was only one person at the front desk for the whole hotel) I was able to obtain my room key. After the family and I lugged everything upstairs we found bed bugs. Not only were there bed bugs but there was holes and stains in the sheet but the room had a horrible stench as soon as you walked in. Once I went downstairs to address this issue I was given another room but was unfortunately locked out of the old one which housed all of our belongings. Then the security came up to do a ""report"" which led to nothing but attitude. He asked about five times what was my name and I replied ever time what my name was, he kept saying I wasn't the one for the room. I tried talking to him but he kept rudely cutting me off, I then asked to speak with the manager of the hotel and he lied saying he was the manager. Later I found out he was not the manager of the hotel, not only did I receive attitude from your staff but I was lied to. My family trip was suppose to been fun and relaxing but it turned out to be horrible, not only for me and my spouse but for our kids as well. Just horrible customer service and bad room service."
2.5,1,"We've stayed multiple times at the RV Park over the last few years. The WiFi never works nor does the so called cable tv. The cable once was great. They've since changed providers & it's worthless. This trip, when trying to sign on to WiFi, I kept getting wrong password message. Went to office to ask if this was correct password or if there was a different one. The lady stated I had the correct password & that too many people must be using the WiFi at the same time & password on the paper is correct. Maybe a little time should be spent looking into the WiFi to see if something is wrong or if hacked. So for a week & had to use my data plan that I used up so my provider charged me $15 more on my monthly plan. We pay $$ to stay here & to use the amenities. I'm tired of paying for things that I can't us. The dumpster aren't in the enclosures. The trash company dumps the trash, leaves trash on the ground & dumpsters in streets. You would think that AZ Charlie's would have a team that would go around & clean that up & put dumpster back in enclosures. Then said team should go around to make sure spaces a clean & ready for next guest. The RV Park office people used to be very nice. Now they're basically rude or just don't give a damn. 

The last year or so I'm not feeling very safe. In the adjoining neighborhoods every single night there's multiple gun shots (not RV parks fault of course) but I'm terrified a stray bullet could hit an RV in here & I don't want it to be mine. Not an exaggeration 

This WILL be my last time to EVER stay. I doubt anyone one from AZ Charlie's reads these reviews nor cares how people feel about paying for amenities they can't use but it makes me feel good to yelp & let others know how it truly is."
2.5,3,"Not a bad hotel, i got what i paid for.  Its off the strip by about 2 miles, not a bad drive. Reasonable priced placed around."
2.5,2,"I cannot say about the rooms, but from the view from outside, dark and dingy... the slots here are pretty tight and usually can find a $5 table, not today, wtf? They have no progressive bonus to justify having $10 pai gow table, plus its the only pai gow here, i guess i play at eastside more for that bet, since their progressive is well over $200k, worth playing for.. They continued to be like this i ll just go play some where else.. Its way too smoky to stay and play anyway.. The food is ok, reasonable, lots of old folks local hangout..The staff is ok, its hit or miss, depending on who you deal with, sorry to say i don't consider one of my favorite casino."
2.5,1,"Stayed here Thursday 6/22/17. 
Checking in front desk person was very friendly but as soon as you walk into the casino you get hit with the smoke..eww!

Got our rooms (2 rooms)...came in my room,..got hit with a good smell of icey hot...like if literally someone just applied some...looked around everything looked good except no remote, so i call front desk and she answers with anger in her voice...so nicely i said we just checked in and we dont have a remote...her response ""ok, ill send a tech to bring you one"". Ok good.....

2nd room...mold in the shower, walk right out and went to get a diffrent room. Front desk puts us in a ""suite"". Room was hot, but we thought it was just cuz they might of just turned it on...it stayed comfortable but never got cold.

Aftet waiting on this tech for an hour now...we left to pick up dinner. When we got back we noticed a man in front of our door...barely holding himself up with the railing....sister and I looked at eachother like wtf...she said maybe its the maintnance guy with our remote?!?! And sure enough it was, mr maintnance guy was soooooooooo freakin drunk he could barely talk to us and he already had bad english (mexican man). So between sister and i we had to look at eachother to try to understand him...and we speak spanish so it wasn't that we didnt understand...it was just that he was slurring out his words because of how intoxicated this man was.

After all this craziness, the rest of the night was quiet and when i went back to tge front desk to check out this lady from Gwam was there, very friendly and she greeted me as soon as she noticed me walking up to the desk. 

For how much we paid and dealing with this drunk maintnence guy and rude front desk lady during check in...we will definitely put this hotel last on our list...."
2.5,3,"We stayed here for 3 nights at a great price ($133.00) we got through Expedia. Check in was fast and friendly but upon check out a small problem arose with my deposit being returned. Alfter a couple of phone calls, this problem was fixed and I recieved my deposit. The woman handling this issue could have been a little more friendly in my opinion, after all it was their mistake. The room was big, comfy and clean with a seperate livingroom area. Nothing fancy by any means, a little outdated, but it was clean.The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the sink is right next to the bed. There is a 7-11 around the corner and I always saw security roaming around whenever we were coming and going which was nice to see.
The buffet was horrible. We ate there once for dinner and once for breakfast. The prime rib at dinner was decent, the made to order waffles at breakfast were cold and hard, as was most of the cafeteria style food they offered. The service was good and friendly.
The casino was nice in the fact that it wasn't overly crowded, had a good variety of machines and paid out decently. The beverage servers were non existent.
This place is about a 10 minute drive from the strip. I would stay here again for the price and accomadations but definately eat elsewhere."
2.5,1,"Horrible experience here, checked in on Sunday the 9th of april, the next night I caught a bed bug crawling on my wife's leg in room 1507, when they came to see i got nothing but attitude from their so-called security, and their hotel manager LAURA SELANDER , was of no help either, not to mention their risk management department wich totally denied this thing I caught and handed to them in a napkin was a bedbug, the whole time treating us like criminals, !!!"
2.5,5,The Yukon Grille is the best. Don't waste your money at Ron's Steak House. This is the far best than that restaurant. Dollar wise you can't beat it. Our server was Annmarie  who is an asset.
2.5,1,"There was so much wrong with this hotel I just don't have the time to write it all down I will just down load the horror - Check in no valet no one there to show you what and where + the room wow front door did not close right? big gap you can see the out side??? + the plumbing was so loud it woke me up many times + the carpet may have never been cleaned + 7 channels only? + no wifi + bad beds and bad furniture + no light bulbs in the lamps and the one with a bulb did not work the closet has never been cleaned I am sure of that + I don't think there was any insulation in the walls. do not go here it is cheap but not cheap enough and the casino is so out dated we did not even try it.,.,.,.,."
2.5,1,"Wanted to check out a different local casino so I chose Arizona Charlie's. What a mistake. This place f*cking sucks! First off, it's a locals casino so it should have better pay backs, right? NOT! Most of there machines have as low of a return rate than the Strip. All you have to do is check the pay tables. Wanna a drink? You'll be ignored unless you look like a homeless bum playing penny keno. Lots of loser bums in this place. Like cigarette smoke with crappy ventilation? You'll love it here."
2.5,1,I've never been to a worse place with more useless employees than at Arizona Charlie's. Specifically...the front desk supervisor. Worst experience ever.
2.5,2,"Pros, Cons, then summary

Took my family to Las Vegas to watch the Monster Truck World Finals.  I was not in town this time to do the typical ""Vegas"" thing:  clubs, gambling, nice buffets, etc.  

PROS--Only a few miles from Sam Boyd Stadium.  Near some good fast food joints (ex: In-N-Out, Sonic, local joints, etc.).  The hotel was cheap, probably the only reason for two stars.  The shower had good pressure, and the toilet worked fine.  One huge pro was that the AC was a newer model and worked very well.  It kept the room at a constant cool temperature and was cold our entire stay.  Ice machine worked well too.  Because the neighborhood was a bit shady, they had bike security 24 hours, and they were nice and professional.  More importantly, the security was visible at all hours and seemed to take pride in their job.

CONS-- Very dirty rooms.  The floor was filthy.  We basically had to wear flip-flops in the room because wearing socks, or no socks, would turn the bottoms of our feet black.  The TV was state-of-the-art if it was 1991.  Old box TV.  Also, we had to call the front desk because it didn't have a remote.  (On the plus side, they did come in a few minutes)  The pool was rather small and dirty for a place this big.  I didn't do any gambling but did spend some time scouting the casino for future reference.  It was as others have described....old retirees, elders, and other odd people.  The neighborhood is shady.  Don't plan on walking anywhere after sunset (unless you have a CCW). There are numerous pimps and prostitutes up and down Boulder Hwy.   


Would I come back here?  Probably not, unless all other places were booked solid.  I'd trust a Motel 6 or Super 8 over Charlie's.  It's only redeeming value is if I ever plan to go to Sam Boyd stadium again.  Otherwise, if you're looking for the ""Vegas"" experience, this is not it.  Too far off the strip and no real nightlife."
2.5,2,"Would of given it Four stars but couldn't believe no free wifi...they charge you $11.99 per day for wifi, come on in this day and age not to provide free wifi that's a good reason to go elsewhere."
2.5,3,"Got a ""Suite"" for about $40 for a Monday night (after tax, No Resort Fees!), very roomy.  Couch and TV in one room and a TV in the bed room.  It was a steal on the surface, but no frills.   However, only one TV had a remote (Bed room), no big deal so I told desk clerk at check out a remote was missing, she said no problem.  TV sets were early 90s vintage but got about 30 channels.  Also, walls were thin and you could hear noises at night from people in other rooms so it was tough to sleep. Shower and wash room was basic, not unlike Motel 6.  Can't comment on gambling or food, did neither there, just stayed the night.  No line at all to check in and clerks both check in and check out were very nice.  Only about a 2-minute walk to casino, enter rooms from outdoors.   Not too far from strip or downtown or east side casinos.  Adequate when you don't want to pay strip prices; classic case of you gets what you pays for."
2.5,5,"Place is incredible!! Clean and affordable. Friendly staff. Except for the meat cutters at the buffet..is there a reason they cut the meats paper thin? I mean it isn't free we pay for it. After speaking with debbie tge asst manager of buffet she replied they changed company? Wtf?? I then suggested that they post a sogn above the meat section..""KIDS MEAL"""
2.5,2,"I was rolling over 3 stars but figured 2 would do it more justice. We spent 2 nights here and I tried to stay in the room as minimal as possible. 

Review is for room only... its very rundown looking. Those flowery cheap curtains that match the bed sheets. Restroom was very confined. My car trunk seemed bigger. Not that I have used it as a restroom or so. 

Aside from the room... everything else is just just average or below. Valet dude was polite. Insisted on tip even tho he never parked our car. Parking lot is pretty big, always found a good spot. Front desk guy was cool... however offered no help on whats going on ON the Strip as far as shows an attractions goes. FAIL! 

2/5 because I have had MUCH better. Esp in Vegas!"
2.5,2,"Came here for bingo, this place seemed more geared towards an older crowd than those around my age. Each session runs you about $6-20  depending on what kind of packets you buy and if you go electronic or not. I spent a total of $11 on a small rainbow packet, two additional cards for the final round including a double prize multiplier or something, and the validation on my cards which apparently involves a larger prize at the end for winners.

The session comes with two complimentary drinks, so it's easy to break even if you dont win anything. The drinks however only seemed to contain a single sip of alcohol per so its best to order beers than a cocktail.

I had an odd interaction with the cashier, it was my first time playing and she was hesitant about selling a larger packet to me and my friend because of that. Her argument was that we wouldnt be able to keep up. Why care? AC still has our money regardless if we can or not.  After insisting we could handle the small rainbow,  she told us to fold it in half when we get into trouble. We never did, we had no issue scanning for our numbers..."
2.5,1,"BED BUGS!!!!

For starters, I stayed here during EDC weekend (May 17-21). When we arrived at the hotel and tried to check in to our room, the front desk receptionist not only gave us the wrong room but also gave us attitude when we requested a room change to a deluxe which was originally the room we paid for. 

Then the following morning I woke up with multiple bug bites, then day after I woke up with more. I requested a room change and they switched us to another room but didn't follow through with their investigation as they promised till this day. (6/17/18) 

No compensation was given to me even after I've talked to multiple managers and they still refused to refund me for those two nights I experienced the bites. 

Never staying here again, nor do I recommend staying unless you're trying to get eaten alive by bugs. 

Also they have shitty customer service."
2.5,1,"I stayed here because it was on labor day weekend and i was attending my cousins wedding on the strip.  The strip hotels were over $200 a night so I could only afford a hotel in the $90 range on the weekends.

The room was big, nice, comfy, casino was good, resturant was good, free wifi.  The BAD PARTS is its in a sketchy hood. It's an outside hotel. Casino is seperate from the hotel.  It seems like a really trashy truck stop place, and i could hear the people having sex in the room next door, and I mean everything from the sound of the neighbors tv, toilet flushing to them having sex on the table. TRASHY!  I did tell the management and they gave me a refund of one of the 3 nights which was nice"
2.5,1,"To be completely honest, the only reason i'm giving 1 star is because quite frankly I can't give 0 stars. 

For starters the people who work at the first desk need to work on customer service not only were they rude but they gave us the wrong room and when the issue was brought up, it was a problem. 

Onto the room... the furniture was very outdated. The room smelt of cigarettes, although it was a non-smoking room, and like it hadn't been cleaned in many, many months possibly years. My family and I stayed at this ""hotel"" for 4 days and on the 2nd day, I woke up with insect bites but I didn't think anything of it because it's Vegas in the summer so I immediately thought mosquitoes. I WAS WRONG!! 3rd day there I woke up with two more bites... BES BUGS!!! 

Yes the ""hotel"" is cheap. But the area is AWFUL!! In most words, it's not worth it!"
2.5,1,"this place is deplorable. the carpets were filthy, only one outlet worked, i had to call the maintenance man to come in right before midnight to fix an  outlet.

also, i was bitten while i stayed over night. i am not sure what bit me, but i have a swollen right finger from staying here.

do yourself a favor, save your money, go somewhere else, and for the love of pizza, don't eat at that buffet. it was horrible.... absolutley expensive and horrible.

this is a real review, from a real person that stayed at this nasty deplorable place."
2.5,1,"This is the first time my family and I have stayed here and it will definitely be the last! Housekeeping didn't come in to clean the room, make the beds nor leave clean towels. We have stayed Downtown at The D, Palace Station ,we stayed at Boulder Station and at Sam's Town and their service is 10 times better than this place! My daughter and her family also stayed here, the 1st time she had ants in her room but they quickly gave her another room and were very apologetic so she decided to stay here again but now this time her room had roaches!!!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL WE STAY HERE!!!!!"
2.5,3,"The hotel is actually motel style, but I'm not picky. All I ask for is a clean room with a comfortable bed, and that's what I got. The shower is an enigma to figure out, though. I stayed at Arizona Charlie's for an entire week and I left the place still unable to figure out how the hell the shower works.

Also, the in-room wireless never worked, but at $12.99 a night it's not really worth it anyway."
2.5,1,The place is horrible! Everything is outdated and the service in restaurants is below any eating establishment that I have ever been. Don't know how they keep the doors open.
2.5,4,Very nice place a little off the beaten path but nice.  Friendly service and very accommodating with our requests.  Made sure our parties were close together even during the busy week.  Inexpensive was way cheaper than all the rest $70 a night versus over $200 for the others they give you two little rooms  very nice and the water pressure in the shower was great going to stay here again
2.5,1,"If I could give this place a zero I would. Only reason it's a 1 is because they at least refunded me one night. I had reservations thru Vegas.com & apparently they over booked my room. I got there Friday night at 10 & by midnight someone tried to barge in our room bc they had the same room ?!! & access as well?!! My kids woke up screaming !! So I run to Check and the person left. Come 2am security comes banging on my door like they're the police asking me for Id bc the room
Was for someone else ?!!! So now my whole family is woken up twice & security is checking to see why my door key opens a room that's already been booked ?!? They literally Check 3 other rooms & my key opens them! Long story they wanted me to change rooms but then realized it was their fault! The rooms are filthy and on one nightstand it looked like a crack pipe burned thru it!! I asked for non smoking room
& nope that also didn't happen. I would NEVER go here again."
2.5,4,"I travel to Las Vegas regularly -- two to four times a year.  I'm a poker player always looking for an edge.  The last thing I want is a luxury-priced hotel that cuts into my thin bottom line.  I prefer budget accommodations.  So half a dozen years ago I went with this property located about 6 miles away from the Strip, on Boulder Highway, just a little north of Henderson.  But I always rent a car and don't like the long lines of the large strip hotels anyway.  So this property's somewhat distant location was not much a deficiency for me.
   The casino has a very nice restaurant, the Sourdough Cafe, with terrifically inexpensive specials , especially breakfast specials. The rooms themselves are well worn, acceptable in size if not spacious, and modestly appointed, with nothing extra -- no microwave or refrigerator (at least not in the standard rooms).  There is an outdoor pool on site but no gym.
   The location is a step above awful -- that doesn't bother me at all.  But if I were a woman staying alone or a family with children I might give it some pause.  There are ""working girls"" who clearly frequent the property and the sidewalks near it.  But to the property's advantage are three large full-service and budget-oriented casinos: Boulder Station, Sam's Town, and The Cannery East.  The Longhorn Casino, home to many very inexpensive breakfast and dinner specials is also within a nice stroll.
   The best reason to stay is the price -- among the very lowest in the Las Vegas area.  And, to top it off, THERE IS NO RESORT FEE!!!!!!!  All things considered, this is the best deal for an acceptably clean and functional casino hotel room."
2.5,4,"I dont see why all the one star reviews. If u expect this to be the same as the bellagio you tripping. Its a cheaper option off the strip. We got a suite. The room was clean. I was happy. Pool was nice daughter loved it. Dinner buffet was good. No bed bugs. Didnt see any pimps or hookers as the previous reviews said. Lol anyways charlies isnt dead, yes we'd stay here again. Room 3302, the toilet is hella loose and crooked. And the sheet of linoleum in the bathroom is loose and coming up. Minor complaints. Charlies was cool"
2.5,4,This is a nice place off the strip.  The rooms were fine.  What they really need to do is power wash all the sidewalks and lower portions of the buildings.  That little effort would really improve the impression of the place.  My biggest complaint is their hotel check in and check out.  They have a lot of hotel rooms and only 2 stations to check in and out of your room?  Really?  Do they really not want hotel guests that badly?
2.5,1,"This is the worst buffet in town. Prime rib has NO taste, shrimp was cold. Very small selection.  One poor guy waiting on the whole room. He gave good service considering the amount if tables he had to take care. Will never go back even for free. My opinion is go to Sam's Town Firelight Buffet. Similar price and so much better variety and taste."
2.5,3,There is now a modest resort fee.   So I don't stay here anymore.   It was fun while it lasted.
2.5,4,"4 dollar ham steak and eggs with hash browns and toast served all day is a deal worth driving for. And $1 Bloody Marys and Mojitos is an added bonus. Make sure to order the eggs country scrambled, they know how to cook them. Can't review the rest of the menu but this breakfast and drink special is old Vegas relived. Enjoy!"
2.5,1,"This place should be shut down period!! 
This was the most ridiculous excuse for a hotel I have ever seen. The front desk staff was incredibly rude, our roll away bed for one of our daughters that we paid for at 4 pm check in we did not receive until 9:30pm after I went back to the front desk to inquire! The floors were filthy, the second bed in the other room had blood on our sheets, the tub and shower unit was not clean and had mold on the shower head, the pod coffee maker did not work, the lamp in the front room needed a bulb that I finally received 26 hours after I requested it the first time, the dumpsters in the parking lot below our room where over flowing and stunk horribly, their were hookers in both the front parking lot and the rear not to mention the drug selling and activity in the parking lot was active 24 hours a day. This place really, really, REALLY SUCKS DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME or money!!
BTW this was recommended by Hotels.com. Absolutely Rediculas!!"
2.5,1,"Don't be fooled by the security guards, because the criminals aren't. I stayed in the RV park for 1 month, my bicycle and shop vac (both chained up) were stolen.  Nightly gun shots in the area, and no shortage of police dealing with patrons in the park itself.   I've left a number of messages with risk management,  still haven't heard back.  With better security this place would be nice, but it's in a really bad part of town."
2.5,4,"I was actually very surprised when i walked in my room. 2 rooms, with 2 beds! For the price.... it's SO worth it! 24 hr Bingo is another bonus. The buckets of beer for $5...
FREE parking and NO resort fees. I just booked another stay here, it is my go-to place from now on. Especially when i dont hang out on the strip much... i prefer the double-down saloon and the dive bar.  There are security guards monitoring the parking lot. Im very thankful for that... especially since my friends just had their entire trailer stolen right off their truck in a parking lot at another hotel.
update: they added resort fees. still super cheap though so i will just pay it"
2.5,2,"My complaint is specifically about the restaurant, Sourdough Café.  I had stopped there at 10:50pm last night to order a cheeseburger and onion rings.  The restaurant was practically empty with only about 2-3 tables utilized.  Like I have done many times in the past, I asked if my food could be delivered to the bingo hall as I would there playing bingo.  The manager who took my order said sure that would not be a problem.  At the beginning of the final game of bingo, about an hour later, I returned to the restaurant to find out what happened to my order considering I have never known it to take an hour to cook a cheeseburger.  Turns out my order was just sitting there on the cashier counter getting cold.  When I asked the manager what happened she replied very nonchalantly ""We are short handed so no one was available to deliver.""  Couple of things: Number one, there were four people (counting the manager) standing at the cashier counter just talking when I walked up.  Number two, as I already stated the place was dead.  Number three, when I placed the order why wasn't I informed at that time delivery was not an option.  And number four just how long were they planning to leave my food sitting there as it was barely warm when I picked it up.

Very poor customer service experience."
3.5,1,"Park is stale.  Old.   Not a park, more like a parking lot or storage lot.  Rules are nuts, no Trash can outside!? No tools, no spare parts, nothing!   We have two kids and we threatened because our kids had a few toys outside.  There is only one picnic table I could find in the whole RV park.  Why don't they have them in the spaces!?!  Our pull through was so uneven and tight we couldn't level our RV.  
The staff ALL smokes, and they have no problem welcoming you or complaining with a cigarette hanging out of their mouths.  Just a trailer trash type of RV park overall.

I will never come back to this place."
3.5,4,"A great Vegas RV Park. Well maintained, nice pool and hot tub area, super clean shower and laundry facilities.  
Vickie, Kerry and Toni are a great team, always friendly, willing to be of help and compassionate. They manage front desk, store, lounge/TV area and offer free DVD rentals. I stayed 10 months setting up my tiny house and enjoyed the holiday lunch events. The best and safest in the area. Thank you Duck Creek!"
3.5,4,"I would describe this park as more of a nice parking lot. All sites are paved the same as a parking lot with lines dividing the sites. The sites are level and there is minimal but nice landscaping around some sites. There are no picnic tables which you often find at other RV parks. It appears many of the sites are occupied by men from out of town who live in campers during the week. Consequently we didn't see many people outside but we heard some noisy trucks at 6 am. 
I did find it annoying that in order to get a key to the pool area I would have to pay $5 for a key. Guess they have lost a lot of keys but I am not used to being asked to pay for the opportunity to use the park's amenities. Didn't pay it and didn't use their pool. Did have to pay an extra dollar a day for our dog which was ok. 
Wifi worked great, dog area was good and dumpsters were close by. We would stay here again if we were in the area again."
3.5,5,"Clean and nicely landscaped, the staff is very accommodating and helpful.  Very reasonable price with passport America"
3.5,5,".  Stayed in a 30ft 5th wheel.After 4 months of rv travel we got a site here for a month's stay to rest and recuperate.  Very nice place. Handy to grocery stores, restaurants, and shopping but out of the crowds of downtown.  Park is very clean= staff is nice.  Power is dependable and WIFI is good. Restrooms very clean.  If you stay a month you are charged for power separately and put down a $200 deposit.  Very quiet residents. Not far to Vegas attractions.  We will  stay here again if we come back this way. Haven't used pool or other amenities yet but they look well kept  and clean. Have been here a week and a half so far. Nice plantings and greenery around facilities.They seem to really try to make the place look nice.  You can hear aircraft during the day but that is true of anywhere in Las Vegas and we don't even notice them."
3.5,1,"on a recommendation I booked a weekend at this park for my family.  all started off well enough but turn bad.  first off the park doesn't feel like a RV park.  More of a RV parking lot, spaces are soo tight you can barely fit chairs to sit on outside your coach. Most 5th wheels hitches are in the street and all the trucks are parked in the street infront of the trailers.  makes for a very tight in and out.  If you walk around the park you see trailers and asphalt. Not much of anything else. Most stay in there trailers and you don't have a friendly vibe.  only two picnic tables in the whole park. and only garbage cans are for dog poop and limited access. we as a family with our friends were sitting outside in the morning then We went to the RC car track behind the park for 20min and left our 14yr dog on a leash lying in the sun.  We returned and found the dog made a mess which I promptly cleaned up upon my return. and straighten up the chairs the dog moved over the site.  My friend said to check my vm.  I did and found the mangers threaten to remove me from the park if I didn't clean my camp and berate me over a Voice mail. Just as we were leaving for the evening a golf cart pulls behind my car with two women smoking and waving the cigs all around me and my kids.  Debbie the one that left the voice mail starts going off about my camp in ten years never saw a mess and just couldn't believe what bad people we were.  I really couldn't believe it.  My camp was spotless and I even asked her please point out what you don't like and I will remove it.  all she keep saying was i am getting the rules to give to you.  waving her smoke in my face.  I asked the woman still in the golf cart please tell me what is wrong with my camp site.  she couldn't find anything.  Debbie all of sudden says you can't have that trash can there.  My wife was Oh I didn't realize we couldn't have a trash can out.  This encounter with Debbie and her cig smoke was so unprofessional and berating for no reason. we are all adults and deserve some civil interaction. Debbie said they take the rules very serious and she dropped off a copy that night.   Well after reading those rules I found that they only enforce only some of those rules for some of the people.   I saw  ladders under trailers, other trash cans, spare tires, auto parts outside of trailers,  large dogs on there NOT allowed list.  There was a doberman with a full muzzle on leading me to believe it was not very friendly of a dog.  We saw German Shepard as well. I even saw huge RC cars in front of there own employees trailer which is clearly not camping gear and not allowed under there rules.   So now I feel under the micro scope as I see a man walking though my camp at 7:30am in the morning as I confront him he says he was just checking to see if there was a mess with a attitude.  Really, first thing in the morning how about saying  good morning at least. 

If you choose to go to Duck Creek RV park I hope you are a ex truck driver to get into your space and be very mindful of the rules.  Make sure you get them so you don't get threaten to be removed.   If you like a very sterile looking park and smoke fulled weekend give them a try.


To duck creek Manager,   If you are going to treat people like that make sure you give the a list of the rules upon check in. (which I never received).  also make sure your employees are not smoking withing 20ft of the office and your customers in there sites.  You might also want to be consistent with your rules.  I am in the RV business and deal with thousands of RV customers along the Colorado river.   I will tell every person I can about your park and how I was treated there."
3.5,1,"Remind me a lot more of an RV storage rather than an RV park. It is clean, however, very stale, spaces are extremely small, and there are no picnic table in the spaces (Only 2 in the whole park).  There are trucks and fifth wheels blocking the road, extremely difficult to maneuver into your space.

I wouldn't recommend for families. They have an extensive list of items that are forbidden and they enforce it. Example:  no trash can outside, no toys, no spare tires, no tools etc.  They go around multiple times a day to make sure you don't have these items outside.

A huge turnoff for is also seeing most employees smoking, like, all the time!  You kinda have to accept the smell of cigarettes here.  

The garbage truck also comes Friday evening/Saturday morning at 3am.  I sleep with ear plugs in and this is extremely loud!

We won't be back here, with all the RV parks in Vegas, we'll be looking elsewhere for our next trip."
3.5,5,"We stayed here for one night on our way through Las Vegas.  We wanted to visit the strip for a show but didn't want all the bells and whistles of a gated place.  This was a nice, clean park with nice campers around and about 15 - 20 min. from the strip.  The people at the desk were really nice.  The atmosphere pleasant all around.   The sites were paved and level.  I worried about security when I was wondering where to go, especially since we didn't want to pay for the fancy places.  This place seemed perfectly safe.  A couple of planes went overhead but I heard none at night.  I would stay here again for sure."
3.5,1,"When the manager on duty is looking to find a reason to deny service you know there is going to be conflict. Don't like being compelled to leave a photocopy of state issued ID upon registration. We leave enough personal information with payment by a valid credit card, and the recording your vehicle license plates or tags. Look elsewhere for your stay. Yes, a business does have a right to refuse service to anyone however; that doesn't negate my right to call the management out for its decisions. Even large companies like Home Depot and Target have had issues securing customer data, I'm surely not going to put my faith in this business who stores the copy of my drivers license with home address, and credit card information in an open area where it could easily be lifted by identity thieves."

Modern,well run, and maintained RV park which is just outside the city limits of Henderson, in a nice area of Las Vegas.  Restrooms and laundry are clean and modern.  Staff is incredibly helpful.  There is a small store at the park office for snacks and such. The only downer for this place is that it is essentially a large parking lot.  But the spaces are wide enough for RVs with multiple slides.  All sites are paved which is really nice.  There are a few pull through sites.  Most sites are back in.  Large RVs will need to disconnect from their tow or towed vehicle in the back in sites.  The RV park is located 2 miles from a huge shopping area with tons of stores and restaurants.  Costco is there.  There are casinos nearby including Sam's Town, Sunset Station, and East Side Cannery.  There is a large nature preserve close by with excellent walking and biking trails.  Many of the streets have bike lanes.  The RV park is a 10 minute walk from the UNLV stadium.  There is also a large park that is next door.  The park is in the flight path of the Las Vegas airport.  So there is some airplane noise which I consider not a big deal.  The long term residents are really friendly.  I didn't use the park wifi.  I'm stayed the winter here and liked it so much that I decided to stay next winter as well.  They have security here throughout the  night and I feel absolutely safe in this park.  I really like this place."
3.5,3,"Stayed here for one night while seeing a show at sunset station.  More of a long term rv park.  Quiet and clean, nice staff, 30/50 amp paved backing sites for up to 40' ish rigs.  A reasonable $32 with good Sam discount.  Restrooms, showers, pool and free wifi."
3.5,1,This is by far my worst experience with a Vegas RV campground. The manager (elderly man) was extremely arrogant and totally unprofessional. I understand people sometimes have bad days but for them to take it out on their customer is unacceptable. I would steer clear from this place.
3.5,4,"This place is a great place to escape from reality for a few days. The RV campground is very large and has a number of amenities, which makes your stay pleasant. It has a close proximity to the Strip.
Unfortunately, the spaces are tight in between units and it is located next to an Interstate. Even with this, we slept soundly in the RV campground. The security at the front gate was a positive even though the RV was in a good neighborhood.
The pool, laundry facilities, bathroom were all well maintained and clean.
Would I recommend this park? Absolutely. Would we come back? Absolutely. FOUR stars"
3.5,5,"Was skeptical about moving into an RV Park, but so glad I picked this location. It's cheap, safe, and quite. Only problem is the WiFi is terrible, other than that I don't have one complaint!"
3.5,5,Duck Creek rv park is a wonderful place to go.. Deb and Vicki and the rest of the crew are awesome. I have been coming back year after year will continue to do so!! Love it
3.5,1,"I called here trying to reserve a spot for the summer. The lady I was talking to was pleasant enough until the topic of my dog came up. Asked about dogs, she claimed that they were dog friendly, until I specified the breed. This park has a ban on Dobbies, Pits, Rottweiler, German Shepherd. 

Most dog attacks come from small breed dogs, not large breed, so this rule must be based on the archaic myths about this dogs, which is a shame, and a sad way to lose business.

After I asked about my Rottweiler, the lady I was talking to was down right rude, I'm not certain I'm taking my dog with me this summer, but I am certain I won't be staying here."
3.5,5,"The park is nice - TONS of amenities, clean pool and jacuzzi, small shop, business office, VERY reasonable rates.... But the reason I am giving this review 5 stars is 100% because of Eric at the front desk!  He is so helpful and friendly and every time I'd wander in to ask a question or need something he'd literally jump to help me.  He is the kind of guy you want at every business you ever encounter.  People like him are rare to find and he is leaving such a favorable impression with me - it compelled me to come and write this review!"
3.5,5,"EXCELLENT Customer Service, unbeatable rates and courteous helpful staff!

Deb (Park Manager), Vicky, Marie, Dave, Gerald always make us feel like we've known them for years and make sure our stay here is the absolute best experience we have while staying in Vegas.

24 hour security cameras, with security staff who actually walk the property every night. This park has a fence surrounding the entire property to keep the drug addicts and prostitutes from wandering in off the highway.

A locked gate (guests are provided a key) allows access to a HUGE beautiful recreational park adjoining the property. Great for walking dogs.

This is absolutely the BEST pet-friendly, family friendly RV Park we have stayed at and we are full time RV Enthusiasts having stayed in RV Parks all across the country!

We shopped around the various ""RV Parks"" along Boulder Hwy and soon discovered that if you don't want to be parked next door to drug addicts or prostitutes living out of their 1979 ""recreational vehicle"" (if you could even call them that after 25 years) you can save yourself a lot of time and headaches by just driving straight here!

These guys run a nice, extremely clean,  classy operation here. The park manager makes it a point to walk the park DAILY to ensure the entire park and sites are maintaining a high standard of cleanliness and that the guests are satisfied with their experience while staying here. They have so many regulars who keep returning year-after-year.

The common areas are cleaned daily and even the streets are swept with a street cleaner!

This is now our first and only place we stay when we bring our RV to Vegas!"
3,5,"THIS IS YOUR GUY FOR EVERYTHING TRAILER. Man is a BOSS. Excellent quality work, even has mobile repair service! Fast, convenient, and super inexpensive! He welds, wires, and does RV and horse trailers also.. even ac units. This is the only place I'm going for anything trailer ever again!"
3,1,Called them twice for repair of my RV.  Never returned my call!  Do not rely on them if you need immediate help!
3,5,"I needed a RV wheel bearings grease repack and brake inspection and found this local businessman with excellent Google reviews.  His price was very reasonable and he used all new parts that are ""consumables"" such as cotter pins and seals.  I liked that he used a torque wrench on the lug nuts instead of using an air chuck and the entire procedure was done carefully and completely.  He also measured the brake pads and drums for wear, and checked proper emergency brake operation.  I will be a repeat customer for sure."
3,1,"Nicco told us to be at his shop at noon and he could work on drum and bearings after we were very specific on what we had and needed. When we got there we were told it was ""too risky"". WHAT wasted ALL morning and could have been in a REAL shop!"
5,4,"Great little park with good rates, we'll kept, nice clean bathrooms and laundry room. Even had access to the canal trail and wifi. Felt quite close to your neighbors but everyone was nice. The couple managing we're very nice and checked in on us to be sure we didn't need anything multiple times. We will stay here again."
5,5,"So we chose this place after reading a review from another about how nice they are.  This place is behind a motorcycle repair shop.  Google mapping the area it seems iffy, but if you are looking for a place to stay in the RV for something such as spring training this place PERFECT.  

They are incredibly nice and accommodating.  Of course like most of the area it isn't a kids run around type of place.   We brought kids and it was fine because we didn't stay here for the amenities of the park.  We slept and took the RV to the stadium and back.  

We will stay here next time and I highly recommend if you are looking for a place to stay to give it a shot."
5,5,"I stayed here for a few days and really enjoyed it here.  It is quiet, clean, and reasonably priced.  It has great access to a nearby canal trail that is paved.  I would stay here again."
5,5,Quiet little park off Main Street. Always kept clean and maintained. They have a nice set of restrooms and a laundry room. The owner is very personable and makes himself available if need be. I really liked that they allow pets here. Will be returning.
5,4,"My Wife and I full-time RV and found Twin Palms RV Park on the internet. We stayed 30 days and had a very enjoyable stay. The park has about 16 spaces, kinda tight, but they accommodated our 40 foot fifth wheel toy-hauler. The spaces are not all the same length. They have 50 amp power, with water and sewer at each site. The park is behind the owners motorcycle shop, Steve's Cycle. The park is very clean, and quiet. The motorcycle shop was not a problem.  They have a laundromat and restrooms have showers. We liked the fact Camping World is right across the street. We would stay there again. Why I didn't give it 5 stars, is the park has gravel with a concrete pad. We have two Harley's and gravel is not a friend. The road thru the park is paved. Thanks Steve, owner, and Paul, manager for a great stay."
5,5,"My fiancé and I parked here for 8 days at the end of May so we could visit her family and go to a wedding. Steve was helpful and courteous every time I talked to him. It's a small park, but the spot itself was plenty roomy for our 34.5' rig. We're no good at backing in, but Steve was able to guide us in with no problem. If our travel plans again call for multiple nights in the Valley area, we'll definitely look to stay at Twin Palms again."
5,4,"This is a small, quiet well kept RV park. Internet, laundry, bath facilities were all wonderful. The owner and manager were very nice and helpful, stayed here 3 mos would of stayed longer if they would of had the availability."
5,5,"We recently stayed at Twin Palms for 2.5 months with our two dogs. Park was the epitome of cleanliness and safety, all for a very fair price. Bathrooms and laundry facilities were impressive compared to other parks we have stayed at. Twin Palms is located on a canal, which is great for walking dogs or riding bikes to the nearby grocery store. We met many delightful people during our stay here, our favorites being Paul and his lovely wife. They are genuinely just the nicest and most helpful people and we are so happy to have met them! If you are looking for a QUIET, CLEAN, SAFE park, this is the place for you!"
5,5,"I agree with the positive points others have written. 
They care about their customers. The best Wifi anywhere."
5,5,"We had a wonderful 3 nights stay here!
Small, very very clean, quiet park with Full hookups. Steve (owner) also owns a cycle shop.. Some of the reviews say there is some motorcycle noise but we never heard any of it.. They have beautiful clean bathrooms with a shower . One person only. They have a gate leading out back to a canal where we could walk our dogs and we also saw many people on bikes and walking. Nice feature if you travel with dogs or like to bike or take walks! Paul was a great help with getting us parked in our spot and was extremely happy to help in any way! We will definitely stay here again!!"
5,5,I found this through the internet it's a little teenie Park that is so perfectly well maintained quiet even though we're right in the middle of town sitting behind a motorcycle shop you'd never know it I think there are about 13 or 15 spots total excellent laundry room really nice showers and bathroom the grounds are immaculate and the management extremely nice
5,5,"We stayed here while in the Phoenix area for a friends wedding. It's quite small but laid out very well. The manager on duty was very helpful when we arrived and upon our departure. This park is kept up very well, with each space being level and having its own bushes for some privacy. They have wonderful bathroom and laundry facilities. This park backs right up to a nice bike path which was wonderful for walking our two pups. We enjoyed our stay so much that we decided to extend it by a few more days. The owner was very nice and accommodating. Would highly recommend this park if passing through the Mesa AZ area."
5,5,"Stayed here at Steve's lot for 4 months. The access to the canal from the back was awesome for our 2 dogs, the place is always neat and kept up, and the bathrooms are luxurious if you ask me. They definitely take real good care of this place, and although it is small it was perfect for my husband and myself. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking, and the price is perfect especially since they keep an onsite bathroom, shower, and laundry facility."
5,5,Nice. Clean. Safe.  Steve the manager was super nice to help get us settled in. Very accommodating.
5,4,"Recently stayed here and had an overall great time! We stayed in the studio style cabin with a balcony overlooking the beach area and part of the lake, great view! The room itself was very clean, small fridge and microwave, no stove stop however. The beach area is just a short walk away, HOWEVER, the beach area is down a very steep hill with no stairs or really any safe way down. Small paths which honestly kind of scared us praying each walk down we would not brake our ankles. That is the reason for taking a star away. This should be advertised in some way, absolutely don't come here if you have trouble with steep hills or have any type of handicap with walking, you will need 2 strong legs to be able to enjoy the beach/lake. Grills are charcoal only, they had one gas grill but never felt the need to put a gas tank in it. Also they have a fire pit on the beach but again you must bring your own wood and really no where to sit by it. Bring water shoes as the sand is covered with hundreds of sharp shells. This ""resort"" is also a place where anyone can join as a membership so be aware sometimes it's busy with random people and apparently dogs are allowed at the lake area which personally I did not like. They have a big pool, just a big rectangle pool, zero shaded areas so an umbrella may be useful for pool and lake. The pool is nothing special and on a Friday while were there they had a camp come in with tons of kids to use the pool, not so fun for guests staying at the ""resort"". Again many things they do not advertise which they should in there website. We tried to grill on the grills provided on the cute ""event area"" but they would not light because of the wind, so we had to use the ones by the lake every time to grill which meant lugging everything down the awful hill. They really need to make some better paths for that hill. The cabin itself was pretty private, I never heard or were bothered by other people here which was a plus. There is also a boat area to rent boats personally a little expensive, we didn't rent anything. They do provide towels and a couple sets of utensils. They do not provide dish soap. They have TVs which have Netflix only. The beds are some kind of temper pedic type mattress, a little uncomfortable for my personal preference I like firmer mattresses. The little studio cabins all have small balconies. Cabin 14 is the only bigger cabin that has a balcony of its own. Cabin 16 is the only rustic looking cabin with some kind of detached balcony area. The rest of the cabins do not have balcony's. I would suggest a grilling area up where the cabins are, would have made our stay much easier. Overall it was a relaxing time, we enjoyed ourselves, and may come back someday. Also call the resort directly and ask about prices, they are advertised on so many websites it's hard to find the cheapest price, I found booking directly with them for me the lowest price, again hard to tell. Clarify the cleaning fee and taxes, it's not included on most of the websites."
5,5,"Words cannot describe how amazing this place is. I actually was in Charlotte for a business trip and just happened upon this resort. The cabins are warm inviting and spotless! I had an amazing view of the water through the tall trees.  It's the perfect place to escape while still being close enough to all of the amenities of a big city. The staff is beyond amazing and went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction.  This place is amazing for a single person,couples, and families alike!!!  Five stars doesn't even seem enough to cover how happy I was with this resort and I travel weekly throughout the country for my job.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place to everyone who reads my review!!!!"
5,5,"My family came here for a mini retreat. We found out about this location from AirBNB. We had such an amazing time! We checked in at the front office with SANDRA she is the woman who can answer all your questions she's very knowledgeable about the resort and gives exceptional customer service! 

We received our room key  and walked to our "" tiny house."" It had a two rooms the master had memory foam queen bed, closet and a view of Lake Wylie and the resorts private beach! 

The other room had a bunk bed for the kids. The kitchen had a full fridge, stove top, a table with 4 chairs and a futon. I will post pics!  

They have a large pool that has a life guard on duty from open to close! 

You can also grill, have a bonfire  by the beach and enjoy the forest around you! I will be back!"
5,5,"Long Cove Resort is a glamping community located on an old campground that has been converted to a great space that includes a very nice pool, super cute bathhouse, new community cookout patio, beach area and 15+ glampers. There is also a marina on site that rents boats (15% discount). 

The glamper we stayed in was new and a perfect layout. The master room had a comfortable mattress. The mattresses in the bunk beds and fouton weren't great. The bathroom linens were thick. The sheets were standard. The decor was super cute and comfortable. The upstairs loft was perfect for the whole group to play cards in. I suggest bringing extra plastic silverware and plates just to be safe. Air conditioner worked perfectly....we were very comfortable. 

I would absolutely recommend staying in the glampers at Long Cove Resort. There are a few different sizes so be sure to check the listing details to get the best one for your group. They will soon start renting 2br glampers. Also note the resort is close to restaurants, grocery stores, shopping outlets and also the Whitewater Center!"
5,5,"Absolutely amazing atmosphere! This place is very clean, cozy, and comfortable. Can't wait to stay here again!"
5,5,"This place is more than just a diamond in the rough. It is a gem of peace, tranquility and family fun just 20 min from Charlotte. 25 min from my home. I needed a mental getaway and we found it on Booking.com. Everyday I stay here I am more grateful for finding it. My son has fallen in love. We found our peace and happiness again here. Thank you David, Rebekah and Matthew."
3,5,"The owner Mark after reviewing my concerns stated in my previous Yelp review, regarding my previous experience at his business has contacted me in an effort to improve my experience at his shop. Mark has taken care of my concerns by taking care of the previously poor work on my hull. There are still some minor issues that I had noticed after leaving the shop that he has stated he can and will take care of upon my return. He accomplished this latest corrective action in a 1 day turn around. Not too many businesses will care about following up and there reputation, just move on to the next customer. I appreciate Marks efforts to improve my perception of his business. I now would think about them again if I ever had a reason for hull repair. Thanks Mark."
3,5,These guys are AMAZING. Took in a fiberglass pool diving board for some repair and it looks better that NEW! Great price and delivered on time as promised. I will not hesitate to come back to them or recommend them to everyone that I know.
3,5,The owner Mark was great very upfront and honest about everything and got the work done in a timely matter. Also his mechanic knows his stuff inside and out. I will definitely be recommending this company to all my family and friends.
3,5,"Brought my RV in for some miner body work. After inspection , we found some additional paint cracks. Marshall quoted a fair price. He also went out of his way to find a matching paint color that was custom to the body. The end result from Marshall and his crew was stellar. Great Job!"
3,5,"Everything went great - I had a wonderful day with my two boys. Luis was a great guy and not only was competent with the ATV's but knew everything about the surroundings including the cacti and wildlife. We met at the office and then followed him out with the ATV's to a excite at Superstition Mountain that was really spectacular. About a 45 minute drive. The price was good even though the taxes are crazy high in Arizona. ""Conservative"" state? Ha!

 Highly recommend!"
3,1,"STAY AWAY! It took me a while to find this ""business"" on yelp to write a review because I think they changed their name since they had such horrible reviews before. Not sure if they do rentals anymore but I rented 2 jet skis and a trailer from them. First, the trailer had no license plate (which is illegal) and I didn't notice till I was way down the road and had to come back. Second, one of the jet skis (once I was already at the lake and on the water) didn't even run properly, was overheating, melting wires, plastic and smoking out of the back.  To top off this horror story once I retuned them one of the employees asked how the jet skis ran, to which I respond, ""why do you ask?"" He told me they were KNOWINGLY having problems with the POS jet ski that was smoking but didn't have time to fix it... Even worse as I left another employee told me they give 50% discounts if you leave a 5 star yelp review. Ummm no, how about a 1 star. Make that 0 stars."
3,1,"We brought our boat here because we were told that if we brought it on a Saturday they would look at it on Monday and give us a quote. From there we could choose what we wanted done and once we let them know they would have the work complete within a week. This was not the case at all. Our boat  was there for three weeks and they still hadn't even given us a quote. We called at least 6 times while our boat was there and every time they lied. The first time they told us they were looking at it right now but the guy who needs to be there to finish the quote went home, second time they told us ""it's in the bay right now"", third time they said they would have a quote the next day... so on and so on. We understand that this is busy season and it may take a little longer than expected but there is no excuse for lying. We went and picked up our boat after three weeks. After all the lies and the unorganized nature of this business we do not trust them to get the job done."
3,5,Had a great time the tour guide tom new a lot about the landscape we even saw a rattlesnake and some squirrels. The guide actually ate cactus!!! Would recommend over and over we will definitely be renting again.
3,2,"I would not recommend this shop. I took my basically brand new Waverunners in for a hull repair. What was only supposed to take 1-2 weeks for repair took over 1 month. No communication with me as far as progress of the repair as they said they would communicate. Every 2 weeks checked on on them and they kept saying need more time got other jobs. When they finally did get the minor damage repaired and I picked it up they didn't even bother to polish up the hull. The hull still has a light sanding on it and needed polished. It was perfectly polished when brought into the shop. There were also a few damaged areas where the fiberglass was still showing on the hull. I know you say well have them fix it further. Trust me I just wanted to get my ski back to go get it completed elsewhere. Or do myself, which I probably should have just done. They had also lost my trailer tongue wheel that I left them for convenience of moving around there shop. They did find me one in there shop to replace. The employee was also unaware of their warranty, what it was exactly and the details. Their warranty was not in writing, so had to have him write it down on paperwork. They didn't inform me that they were super busy so not sure why this repair took this long. Just didn't feel like the customer service was there. If there are other shops I'd probably check them out."
3,1,"Where do I begin? Wow.... brought my boat in as it was running poorly (only after doing a tune there over a year ago) I spoke with Marshall, and was told they would look at it in 3 days. Three weeks passed with me inquiring every few days, nothing done. Yet promised each time that it would be looked at by the end of the day. Finally 5 weeks later, they called and said my boat was running like a brand new boat. Excited, I took it out to the lake for the long weekend, put it in the water.... and its barely running, the exact problem I brought it in for was not fixed whatsoever. How is a boat repair shop unable to tell that a boat is running incorrectly? I know nothing and I could tell in 5 seconds it wouldn't move on the lake as is. So I go in, ask for a refund. I'm told I would be taken care of, he will speak to the owner and give me a call. Weeks pass, I call, phone number is disconnected for the next two months. So I drive all the way there, multiple times, each time with more excuses, so I go in one last time, secretly recording the conversation I'm told only the owner can do refunds. I tell him to call him, he refuses, I ask for his number, he refuses, I ask for his name, he refuses. He insults me, calls me a liar, threatens to call the police because I'm trespassing, and finally promises me that if I come back Tuesday the owner will be there and I will be refunded (yes this is recorded) So I leave yet again, frustrated, and I show up Tuesday to locked doors and nobody around. I give up, so I ended up filing with my credit card company to get my refund, as I've wasted so much time and energy dealing with this. Keep in mind I brought my boat there end of June, and now in November they still have not given me a refund, or called me back even once. This is the least professional business I've ever dealt with, it's also clear they don't know anything about fixing boats at all. I took it to another shop and it was fixed in a few days with no issues."
3,2,"Horrible financial customer service...Don't expect your deposit back anytime soon. They told me 5 business days.  Well tomorrow makes 10 business days. Go ahead, try to reach their non-existent accounting department..I dare ya.  I've left 3 messages and no return call.  THERE ARE TOO MANY OTHER LEGIT COMPANIES to deal with their bul$$hit about returning money.  What a joke.

So an update as of April 29th 2016.......  Although it took 3 weeks to get my deposit back the owner Mark called me and got the money back to me quickly once he called me.  Said he had had a family emergency so I give people the benefit of their word. Once.  Mark refunded all of my deposit and gave me 50% of my next rental.  Thats good cuz I am going to rent one for a few more days this time so that to me says he's trying....BTW the CanAm I rented was pretty nice for a rental....."
3,1,"I stopped by and asked them how much to install a crankshaft and balance shaft in a Sea Doo. I told him I have the engine out, I have all of the parts, all he has to do is split the cases, and install the parts. 
he said he would charge me, drum roll please, TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS! 
I thought maybe he didnt understand, I have the parts. I repeated myself. He understood! I said that equates to TWENTY HOURS OF LABOR at $100 per hour, which is RIDICULOUS! 
Shockingly, I took it somewhere else."
3,1,"Please beware, this company DOES NOT RETURN YOUR DEPOSIT. Instead they refuse to return the deposit and indefinitely state they are calculating the cost of damages. The company rarely responds to calls and when they do they refer you to an email address...which of course no one responds to. 

It's a shame to see so many reviews on Yelp that state this same problem (see ""not recommended reviews"" section...very eye opening)."
3,1,"Place has GIANT flashing open sign, I park and walk up and get very rudely told that they aren't open yet. The dude implied I must've been dumb not to know that. Don't go here, not worth your money."
3,4,"Just using the dumping facilities which were $10. Took the time to walk a round and take some photos. My Husband has grown up in ""Hendertucky"" and he remembers this RV park since he was a little kid. Looks like a lot of retirees but then again we saw at least two RV's staying here that were at least $100,000. Family's were using the swimming pool which looked really well kept. The office/ Soda Fountain had everything you would need. I bought ice cream sandwiches for my children while my husband used the dumping station for our trailer."
3,5,"I've been to quit a few RV parks since owning a coach, but...this one has the friendliest people I've ever met. From the day I pulled in, till the day I left, I was assisted with practically everything. Paul, one of the security guards played a major role in getting my rig properly connected and upon departure...disconnected, but connected my car carrier to the coach. This guy was incredible. And I doubt that I could have gotten everything accomplished without his assistance.

The neighbors were exceptionally friendly, from a genuine standpoint. I highly recommend Desert Sands RV Park as your place to stay when in Henderson NV or even near the Las Vegas area. Wish there were more than a five star rating scale.

Happy camping to ALL..."
3,1,"Rodent infested, roach infested and that includes the people. The worst, the place smells like raw sewage frequently, dumpsters are always overflowing. Henderson police are there on a daily basis. The owners preference for long term tenants consists largely of drunks and drug addicts, with that comes thefts. The supposed head of security is a power hungry disgrace, he and his girlfriend have frequent public fights at all hours of the day and night. I woke up once to her looking in my window watching me sleep. The head of maintenance is a registered child molester, it's a matter of public record. The janitor in charge of taking out the trash and cleaning toilets is a nightmare. She targets, threatens and harasses people, she thinks she runs the park. The office manager likes to talk about your private business, extremely unprofessional. No matter who you are or what you do they will start rumors and create drama.

I walked down one of the inner rows one day to visit a neighbor, the air smelled like someone was cooking crank, there was a douce in the middle of the road, a few more feet down the road was a hypodermic needle in the dirt. It stayed there for weeks no one ever cleaned it up.

If you need a really cheap place to spend one night in this area, you will get what you pay for but I'd recommend you go a couple more miles down Boulder Highway there are cleaner nicer places and I'm sure much safer. If you're looking for a long term residential RV park the Mid Way RV park is a great place just one block over and one block back off of Boulder Hwy."
3,3,"Keep in-mind, it's Las Vegas (Henderson) which means the less ritzy part and this park could really use some improvements but it offered a fairly well-kept store, laundromat, clean hot showers and restrooms and a pool. Yes, some of the residents (semi-permanent) are basically the 'Clampetts' with a collection of  accumulated yard junk on or near their rigs, or a mix of cute chotsky that leans towards overly-tacky. I didn't see any 'yard couches' but there might have been one somewhere. Half working mans camp, half retirees on a budget and some down on their luck round out the mix but everyone was very nice and you didn't feel unsafe, even after dark. Rigs are stacked fairly close to each other but the rate was less than half the going rate of most area parks so budget mined-rver's might appreciate the savings like we did."
3,4,"This place works. Want loud, not too busy. This place did well in a pinch when we were in the hot box of Las Vegas. They have a pool. The staff is friendly and helpful, making sure you know who your next to and where not to set up."
3,4,"Desert Sands RV Resort is terrific! Kings Row is not.
     Our family was transitioning from Hawaii. On July 4th, we bought an RV motorhome to live in while house-hunting. Kings Row enthusiastically invited us to stay 
    When my husband recovering from 2 back surgeries, and my daughter still receiving CTCA cancer treatments in Phoenix had a yelling match in the laundry room at Kings Row RV Park, the timid woman that works in the office stood outside the door eavesdropping acting too terrified to go inside even though she knew that they were ill and under duress. We forgi t about this one incident.
   After leaving our motorhome parked at Kings Row in September, we went to a family reunion in Illinois. When we came back with a couple of our kids to live-in a second trailer that we wanted to park next to the motorhome, the owner at Kings Row told us no.
     First, because the trailer isnt owner occupied (our kids were in it, and I said that I would stay in it. The said that no I wouldn't)
     Then, we were given another excuse told that the space was for snowbirds coming to park for the season.
    I showed them to remind them that we had a checkbook with their address, because they said we could stay throughout the winter (snowbirds). We were told we could not stay at Kings Row with no valid reason why we had to go.
     Moving again was a nightmare...thanks for nothing Kings Row.
   We moved to the Desert Sands RV Resort...a match made in heaven. They have strong minded, capable people who are NOT afraid of known shadows.
    Both parks are old, but in spirit, there is no match. ""Kings Row is for old people at heart, and Desert Sands is for young people at heart.""
     DESERT SANDS RV RESORT is well maintained....the rent is better too. The gate is secured at night. It is quiet, and we never had complaints from other snowbirds or management of being noisy. In fact, we have been invited back...anytime.
   We have since sold the trailer, and the motorhome is parked at our new house waiting for our next travel adventure. 
     Our next trip to Vegas won't be anywhere near Kings Row...NO WAY, but we will stay at Desert Sands in a heartbeat...OH YEAH!"
5,5,"We've been going here for over 30 years. They are fair, tell you what's going on, give you a chance to decide what you want to do. I feel their pricing is fair. Heidi is wonderful to work with and really helps you understand what's going on. I feel they try to do their best with each repair. We trust them with our family vehicles and recommend them to anyone looking for help."
5,5,We were traveling in our motorhome when our steps got broken. We called Peterman's and they said come on out and they would take a look. They couldn't have been nicer. Bill spent so much time with our problem trying to figure out the best and safest to repair.  He was so patient and I am sure he had other customers. The mangled bottom step was taken off and down the road we went.The charge was very very reasonable. If we lived in this town we would become lifetime customers! Thanks so much!
5,5,"I've been taking my car here for years, and these guys have always done right by me.  Honestly can't recommend them enough.  If you're looking for a good mechanic in the Penn Hills area, definitely give them a chance to win you over."
5,5,"Laura & Steve are a wonderful, friendly and helpful couple. Just parked our bus there. Good storage rate and easy process. Will check their repair & maintenance service next. Will post my experience here as well."
5,5,"I have stored my 5th wheel trailer and now my motorhome here since 2011.
Prices are lower than other local stolrage area which is nice.
If you pay every 6 months or every 12 months you get a better rate.
Gate gets locked down a t 8 pm and no entry until 5am in the morning.
Owner manager live on site and they have camera all around the area to watch things.
They have a free dump station and if you need maintenance or repair they do it right there.

One day I drove in and started doing some work on my motorhome.
Owner came out to check me out because I drove in with a different vehicle I normally drive. Told her thank you for checking."
5,5,We have stored our motor home here for five years and never had a problem. The proprietors are honest and friendly. They also perform mechanical repairs and that is a great convenience. Steve made repairs to our motor home. The price was A fair one and the quality of his work was excellent. You won't go wrong if you choose them for storage.
5,5,"Great Customer service!!!
Needed a last minute oil change, They got me in and quickly had my rig done while I waited.

Will definitely be back for any future repairs."
5,5,Fast & reliable service at a reasonable price.
5,5,"Excellent service! We needed help diagnosing and repairing a couple of problems with our fifth wheel in a short window of time. Southwest RV really impressed us with their friendliness, expertise and service. They helped us out big time and for a fair price and are now our go-to RV service experts!"
5,5,"I love this place.  It has been 4 years since I stored my trailer here.  It is a little family run business that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone I know. I went today to dump my crapper and then went inside the store to browse around and they remembered me by name.  Not only do they store rv's they have a small store and also do service.  Best thing was when i used to store my trailer here, I did not have to be there for them to do service.  They would go to my spot and get my trailer,  do the service on site, and then put it back.  Awesome customer service that is really hard to fin now a days."
5,5,Family run honest shop in Glendale. They are so knowledgable and willing to get your RV in top running shape.  Probably the best RV place in Arizona.  I would (and do) trust my RV repairs and improvements at this shop.
5,5,"THE BEST!
We tried a couple of other places and then when we found Southwest RV we felt like we were home.
Good prices and HONEST people.  Jeff and Summer rock!  Bring your trailer or motorhome to Southwest RV...you'll be glad you did."
5,5,"Thanks to the knowledge and expert repair of my RV i've been able to stay on the road.  Seems like it's been one thing after another that requires the expertise of SW RV.  Summer is one of the best, always trying to help with temp storage and scheduling.  As a side note, we're in Cortez and the a sewage system fitting has broke.  Succeeded  in temp repair but SW RV will get our unit when we return. Thanks"
5,5,"Southwest RV is now the only place I'll bring our rig to for service! Even though it's 100 miles from home! I had them completely replumb our 2000 Bounder from CPVC to PEX, a really major job. Their work was impeccable, Jeff and Summer a sheer delight to work with and reasonably priced! So glad I found you guys and will be seeing you again!"
5,5,Jeff knows how to take care of his client and always gets me a great price for all my RV needs.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for propane or dumping either.
5,5,Family business with an excellent staff of mechanics.  The price is very competitive with  other service centers. When in the southwest I will be a loyal customer. The staff is friendly.
5,5,"If your looking for a RV repair shop - you can't go wrong with this place!  They do excellent service at fair prices!  The friendly part gets thrown in for good measure!  I wouldn't go anywhere else - and trust me, I've been to some real hum dingers!  Plus, they backup their work!"
5,5,2nd time I've been here and I want to say what a pleasure it is to find a business with honest people they did an excellent job repairing my rv and are very fair with their pricing thank you S.W. RV I'll be referring all of my friends
5,5,Stopped in today to get propane again and Keith was quick to come out and refill my tanks as always. Propane is cheaper at SW Rv than almost any other place around. I appreciate the quick service every time and will continue to come here in the future. They also  have a little store with a lot of different trailer parts and all kinds of stuff.
5,5,"This place is a hidden Gem I have had a lot of accessories added to my RV here always smiling 
Very good customer service oriented business 
Keep up the good work"

UPDATE:

Still the best storage place in town with the best prices. I continue to be impressed with their customer service and willingness to go above and beyond to help. Thank you for everything."
5,5,If you are looking for RV storage or repair they will treat you right. I store my 5wheel trailer with them they will do whatever maintenance I request in a timely manner without me having to deliver the trailer to the shop. They will work on any RV you do not have to store it with them. I would recomend this business to everyone
5,5,"Great family company. We have stored our RV here for years. The owner Jeff and his team a very knowledgeable of ever part of how these things work inside and out and their prices are very competitive.  They have an onsite dump station and propane right there so in reality it's a one stop shop for everything you may need for your RV. I would highly recommend them to everyone. Not only for storing your RV, but also for parts, service or just a simple question regarding your RV."
5,5,"We've been going here for several years for RV maintenance and repair as well as just recently preparing our towed (wiring and base-plate). All work has been done well in a timely manner and at a good price. We recommend them to all our RVing friends.

2.5,1,"When I brought my RV that I bought from them to have warranty work performed they delayed my repair for over a year.  Then when i contacted the manufacturer they said the claim was never submitted.  Buyer beware!!!!  Don't by from them.  Also, don't buy starcraft.  They are crap and their customer service is terrible"
2.5,5,"I rented a trailer RV from these guys for 2 weeks, they made the experience safe, reliable and therefore enjoyable for my whole family. The whole staff is friendly and professional and I want to thank them for making my vacation this summer so special."
2.5,1,"I went here to have my RV refrigerator checked, as it quit functioning.  When the technician called he informed me that the ammonia had leaked out of the unit, rendering it inoperable and needing replacement.  He transferred me to sales and I was told that the cost of fixing it would be about $1600 and that replacing it would cost $2500.  I had previously checked on pricing and found that similar units to mine cost about $1200 +shpg.  I guessed that the labor involved must be complicated.

However, I wasn't going to just say ok.  I went online and discovered that many people are utilizing apartment size refrigerators and set out finding a proper fit.  Turns out that this size refrigerator fits the space with little modification.

I took the old refrigerator out in a matter of about fifteen minutes.  Disconnect the power and LP.  Cap the LP and tape up the 12 volt wires and remove four obvious screws, to pull it out of the opening.  My wife and I did that. I had to trim the opening about a 1/2 inch on one side to get the new refrigerator in place.  I could use the 120 volt outlet that was already there.  Easy job.  Took fifteen minutes.  My wife helped me get it in place.  We're both retired..

We didn't have much more than an hour in the whole project, including clean up afterwards.  I'm not sure why there labor rate seems so high.  I won't go back there again.."
2.5,5,"If I could give them 6 stars I would!!! My boyfriend and I  purchased our trailer from Rangeland last year at the RV show.... We looked at several different models and finally nailed it down to two that we would consider buying ... The other RV dealer at the show would hardly  give us the time of day.... I assume because we are younger and not buying a massive $70,000 trailer or we maybe didn't look serious about purchasing ...... Either way we made the purchase and they have been so great to deal with from start to finish.... Sales, finance, service and follow up.... We had to call this week about some battery issues and Jay and the other guy in service made it an easy swap out even though they were in the middle of moving their office.... Thank you Rangeland RV I will gladly recommend you to all family and friends!!"
2.5,1,"Very poor communication even from the sales people. We purchased a used unit and negotiated specific items in addition to their offered package. It took three and a half weeks for them to get these items done. A new window had to come from the US, but if they had completed the other items, it would have been done in a couple of weeks. (Although we are not sure what they did do in the end). Despite numerous requests, we were never kept in the loop about the status of our unit. No call, not one, that wasn't initiated by us. 
Cleaning was one of the negotiated items. I have never been so disgusted by someone's attempt, if there even was an attempt at cleaning. It took us over eight hours to clean after they did (and I am not overly fussy). And we still have to steam the carpets. Really wish I had taken pictures along the way. It was that bad. 
Did not fill up the coolant levels, reservoir was bone dry.  Engine was down a litre of oil and there was no oil cap on either. One of the beauty rings was put on improperly which broke the stem. This had to be repaired and tires had to be filled. AC condenser was packed solid so had to clean for it to work properly. We could go on. 
That service did not meet minimum standards would be an understatement to the extreme. 
Will never deal with them again."
2.5,1,"If I could put a zero star I would . 
 I had an apt with Jason which he was late. When he was with us he was abrupt and eventually became rude.We were looking at several models and seemed put off by us not knowing what we wanted. But on the phone I told him exactly what my husband wanted and what I wanted. He told me to go online and do my research which I did.  I had specified exactly what I wanted. a pullout with a higher elevated stance on the trailor. He said there is no pullout for any  package that I wanted where I said yes there is . I saw it . And he said no I was wrong they don't. 
 I saw a tent trailor that I wanted to look at which Jason then gave me the gears about having to open more then a couple of tent trailers, made me feel put out because It was an inconvenience to him. He complained that his battery died so couldn't fully extend the trailor. Then he said I should hand crank it. I said ok  give me the hand crank and I will do it. He never gave it to me .  We finally get to check out the trailer  I  liked what I saw  but for several  problems.  The hood lock down clasp was missing and there was rust on several of the  outdoor outlets. The finishing touches were not very nice . I made comments on this and he said this is what you get. it's everywhere.  He then had to leave to help his manager which was fine but he said I'll leave you  to make a decision and so we looked around came back to the office and he was not there  he was with someone else and would be back to see us. no worries we waited. He came back and  we had picked 3 tent trailers out to talk about. He got his pamphlets out sat down . We were standing. His Helmut and his backpack were on the chairs so we stood he didn't bother to remove them. We had some questions and I had asked about the pricing . His reply was when your serious about buying then I will give you the price because the one of the trailors you are looking at is almost sold so we need a down payment before I can give you prices . My husband lost it at that point saying he was nothing but rude and and that we were taking our business elsewhere. My husband said I will never come here and buy a anything from this company and that we were leaving . Jason then proceeded to say yeah it is a good idea that you never come back .  He proceeded to come out and chase us and yell at us as we we're leaving. 
By the way . We went to RACETRACK RV.  They did have a pullout in the sport package. . The sales people were professional. they took their time. explained everything to the point that they WILL have our business. AND we might even buy the more expensive one because he took the time to show us and talk to us not through us and they even suggested a lot more things we haven't considered. 
Thank you Rangeland rv for being rude and inconsiderate to  the point where you drove us out to another more considerate and helpful  Better put together shop.  I will be telling EVERYONE I know."
3,5,I am SOOOO thankful Firebird is under new ownership! I appreciate their attempt to write to me in hopes of a better review. I have no doubt they are better people and run a much better business than the prior owners did!
1,1,do not go to this place. horrible customer service. i have an rv stored at this location and contacted them numerous times to make a payment over the phone and they never awnser the phone. i even went online to try to get a hold of someone. when i finally got through and made my payment i asked to speak to the manager and was given her name and phone number by rachel who works the front desk. i called tammy who is the supervisor and as i was explaining what was going on she started yelling. i tried to explain to her that i am out of state and could not be there in person. she cut me off and started insulting me. after she yelled at me and insulted me she hung up.  i am very disgusted with the level of proffesionalism not to mention that the location of this campground is bad!
2.5,3,First time in a long time at the buffet.  Its better but still needs work.   The fish was a bit dry.  The cakes were a bit hard.   I liked the addition of the ocean salad.  The service was good !!
3.5,2,"The site was fine. However the issue that I had was with the wifi. Duck creek advertises their free wifi on their website. I called prior to arrival and spoke with Dave. Dave seemed like a nice guy; I asked him about the wifi since I would be a late arrival. He told me that the instructions we on the back of the map he would leave me. 
Long story short I was unable to connect and spent over 45 mins on the phone with their tech support. In the morning when I spoke to the front office ladies, they excused the issues by saying that they offer FREE wifi whereas others charge and that other places in Vegas have wifi issues as well. Also, they said that they were aware of the issues and that somebody in the park was using a booster and tying up the wifi. They were still trying to locate the culprit. 
**Here is the issue: when I called and made the reservation they should have told me that they did not currently have wifi available. AND when I call and asked Dave SPECIFICALLY about the wifi, he should have told me that they did not have wifi available rather than tell me he would leave instructions for a wifi system that didn't work. ** this is a case of poor customer service, not just wifi difficulties."
5,5,"We love love this place
We stayed in cabin 10.  Was very clean, cute & homie.  Pool is beautiful, lake was steps away from our door step.  Secluded area but close enough to civilization 
The whole place is hidden gem"
4.5,5,"Pro: close to city, short drive time, some nice trails
Summary: it is a nice trails near the city. However, compare to Bruce trails, you would bump into a lot of kids and families.

I am a regular hiker who hikes at many places in GTA. I like both urban hiking and rural hiking. We came here at end of August using free Park Bus (https://www.parkbus.ca/rouge).
The bus ride was free and pretty short compared to some other ride I took to a hiking spot. I still found the trails pretty interesting. Trails are mostly flat, not that challenging. At the time we came, there was no bugs. Most of the time, you walk along the river. I spent a least 3 hours hiking. The park was pretty big and you could hike here for a couple of days.
I think we might come back for fall colour as well. I high recommend this park for beginner hikers who does not drive far."
4.5,3,"It's a neat idea. Went here and walked up a couple of the trails. Scenery is minimal but there are some interesting plants. The river is nice to walk along or even in the river should you choose to! Pretty easy hike if you want to take kids, it's all flat for the most part with good markers on the trails. Take bug spray."
4.5,5,This is my favourite place to hike. I love the trail that starts on Twyn Rivers. It's always changing as each season progresses. A great place to spend in nature. Not very busy during weekdays.
4.5,5,"Having grown up in Scarborough and around the Markham area, most of my friends and I were very much aware of this awesome urban park. Many a clandestine bonfire and weekend exploration trips took place here and thusly I remember this park fondly. Even if over half the time, we visited at night, hardly walked more than a few hundred meters and spent most of the time staring into the lake with beer in hand, as we discussed the deeper, metaphysical items of the day that linger through the mind of High Schoolers: Mostly, dwelling into who in our Science or Orchestra class was cute and single. Yeah, those were serious and hardcore issues, man. Unlike today, with talks about taxes, immigration, retirements and the US self-imploding through terrible choices, both through local and foreign policies. Not to mention the over politicking of gender expression and feelings which appeal and trigger people who simply can't see the bigger picture or one that is not their own ...Yeah, those cold beers back then, they always hit the spot. Those were way simpler times. Also, we were teenagers. 

Anyway, if you want to go for stroll, you can wonder towards the north end of the park, heading southbound, and partake on trail that winds up and down next to a nearby stream, all the way towards the lake. It is a great walk and if you are into photography (I am) then you can walk it and try to get creative. Obviously avoid it after the leaves fall unless you are into macabre, sort of depressing photography. Since as with any other place, Spring, Summer and the beginning of Fall are you best bets. Now, it is worth mentioning this park is mostly for walking since in overall scenery is fairly minimal, as the park is not very wide, so don't expect to get lost here. You can't. ;-)

It makes for a great place to go with friends or with a parter and absorb a bit of Nature when you do not have time to drive 1-2 hours north. 

I highly recommend it if you feel like going for a small hike and you are already done all the other urban parks in Toronto.  

Give it a try!


PRO TIP: If you stick towards the lake, you can head to the nearby park through Copperfield Road. Yes, it is not connected to the Rouge, but if you find yourself on the lower parking spot on the West end, at the foot of Beechgrove Drive, then you leave your car there, and can follow the path down south, where you can get an awesome view of lake, not to mention a great hidden place to have a bonfire. When I was a kid we used to go there all the time and the cops never showed up! So at night, you could look south and see the lights of the US. And the shores to your east and west used to be dotted with the bright orange lights of bonfires in the distance, of people enjoying the weather, just like you. But times have changed and I am sure, me writing about it here is not going to do it any favours regarding keeping it a total secret *cough, cough.* Thus your Police-crashing-your-get-together-mileage may vary. 

Super PRO TIP: You should be fine if you are not littering. ;-)"
4.5,4,"Rouge National Urban Park is still in the on going development stage, but I am excited that one day when it completed according to the official statement

""Rouge National Urban Park will be one of the largest and best protected urban parks of its kind in the world, spanning 79.1 square kilometres in the heart of Canada's largest and most diverse metropolitan area, overlapping the cities of Toronto, Markham and Pickering and the Township of Uxbridge. Indeed, Rouge National Urban Park will be 23 times larger than Central Park in New York.""

For the time being, there is definitely some confusion as to where the best to park your car? Where is the starting point? Please check website for updates. Seems like Bob Hunter in Markham has trails opened, but if you go to Reesor Road Welcome Centre has no trails as yet.

For Scarborough/Toronto portion, they do have campgrounds and trails. We ended up parking near the Zoo and enjoyed an nice autumn stroll.

More information on the website in the future would definitely be more helpful in the future."
4.5,5,"Although it's billed as Canada's premier urban wilderness park, Rouge Park remains vastly unknown to the majority of Toronto's residents. One hint of that is that Yellow Pages online lists the location as somewhere in Vaughn. Not even close! If you head north of the Toronto Zoo on Meadowvale, you will run right through it, or access it by TTC at the entrance near the 401 in Pickering. I have only scratched the surface of it by hiking along the meandering Rouge River which trickles past Scarborough, as if nothing's happened, winding its way toward Lake Ontario under the 401. The diversity of scenery and terra firma, flora and fauna is jaw dropping with postcard picture perfect vistas all around you. Large cedar trees, some of them just dead scraps of wood looking like potential ships masts leaning against others, creepy looking vines which appear dead yet they look like miniature tree trunks when you get close crawl along the forest floor and then take right angle turns up a tree, grabbing on with twisted knuckle-like barbs and zoom up 10 or 15 meters encircling an unsuspecting tree. Then there are savanna's making you feel baked and tired even though you were just in a heavily scented dark and bushy camouflage of tree stand. Wicked. And that's just at the entrance! Check it out if you dare, even Yellow Pages is too chicken to venture anywhere near it."
4.5,5,"Great place for a hike! Beware of ticks, wear long pants/jeans. Nice stream access and is good in winter or summer!"
4.5,4,"Great place for a hike! We took the free shuttle from downtown Toronto to hike then walked across the street to the zoo after. The guide on the shuttle, Stephanie, was extremely informative. We ended up choosing the Cedar Trail followed by the Vista Trail, both were easy. I would recommend hiking on more trails that run along the river."
1,1,"Worst experience of my entire life. George down at M&M auto body is 100% dishonest and does not follow through with any personal guarantees he made at the onset... He tried to overcharge my insurance company and worst yet they did the worst fix ever. The repair was so bad I didn't even feel comfortable driving my car any more. The body work still showed signs of bondo applications and misalignment panels and short of masking tape and superglue he uses the cheapest replacement parts (used etc) known to mankind. He even went to the extent of installing Pep-Boys stick on chrome trim as my fender trim which didn't even match the rest of the car (can you believe it?) When confronted he had no excuse except that the car would not leave until the job was paid in full, even though any reputable body shop would never let a car back to the customer is such sub-par condition. The fact that he claims to be a professional body man is beyond me. I'd actually consider suing him for such shoddy work, but I'll let my Insurance take that course of action.
I ended up taking my car to a ""reputable"" repair center, to get the entire job redone correctly. Unfortunately at my expense. 
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY FROM M&M. LIFE IS TO SHORT AND PRECIOUS TO PUT YOUR YOUR LIFE IN THE HANDS OF NON-QUALIFIED IDIOTS. Just goes to show you any idiot can hang a shingle out in front (in this case a banner) and claim to know what they're doing. I guess my first clue should have been the absence of any tools in his shop and less than professional ""sons"" that all work there looking to scam their next victim. 
Shame on me for not reading the signs. 
Shame on M&M for claiming to be a body repair center. Someone is going to get hurt by these guys if the state doesn't insist on some licensing checks and balances. 

If there was even a proto-typical scam center that gives the auto repair business a bad name, you have found the poster children here at M&M."
1,1,The attention to detail is lackluster for the amount of time my car was under your care I was under the impression my car would be back in the same condition as when I first purchase the vehicle on top of the situation involving the rental car the whole experience with dealing with this business was unacceptable and unprofessional it was a half ass job full of lies and half truths but I guess I'll take it as a lesson and keep it moving

Come to find out this guy is a complete rip off. So after $11,000 in repairs she gets her car back on a Monday and Saturday of the same week the rear pumper tears off on the freeway. She then discovers all the replacement parts were not replaced. There is still missing parts on the front of the car, there were supposed to be new fenders they are the same old ones, The hood now has damage where someone idiot over sprayed another car near it and ruined the paint trying to buff it, parts of the car were not even bolted back together, there was a dent in the door that was not touched, now to the best part. The rear Bumper that was damaged was not replaced, the hole in the trunk was not fixed (had the bumper cover not fell off we would have not known), and the ""Bumper Cover"" Yea the part we non body people consider the bumper, had a maybe 2-3"" hole in it. rather than replace it like was agreed on the estimate it was filled in bondo half ass repainted and put back on the car.

4.5,1,"My friend and I are heading to the desert SW next week and at the last minute decided to rent a campervan. We googled around and landed here on Escape Campervans. I called the number on the website and spoke to a very lovely gentleman who explained the terms and sent me a quote. After a brief discussion with my friend, we decided to book. THIS IS WHERE THINGS WENT TERRIBLY WRONG. 

When I first tried to book, the link for the credit card information didn't work. I called back and got bounced around an IVR. Eventually landed speaking with another guy who told me he couldn't help me because he wasn't in reservations. He told me to call back and push 1. THAT'S WHAT I DID, BUDDY AND ENDED UP WITH YOU. I obliged and called back again, and got the same thing, but this third guy told me they would likely decline my reservation. Ummmm.... I literally had just spoken to somebody no more than an hour ago who said we'd be all good. WTF? 

I eventually got the credit card info to work, but heard crickets. No email, no phone call, nothing. 

I called back a FOURTH time to confirm and an not so kind Aussie man said I'd likely be decline. This was a complete 180 from my original conversation and this wasn't even 18 hours later. Again, I ask, WTF? 

Needless to say, my friend and I pulled our reservation request and decided to rent a minivan and do things our own way. The minivan is more than $100 less expensive per day, and while it doesn't come with a kitchenette, it does come with roadside assistance and a reliable company to rent from."
4.5,5,"Really above expectations. Great service as we had to shift dates on our trip and make a couple of adjustments. ""Lady Luck"" was a reliable, fun home for a week as we explored the Grand Canyon, Vermillion Cliffs, Zion, and Valley of Fire. Comfortable bed & bedding, fridge kept things plenty cold, and she drove like a champ. Would definitely rent from Escape in the future."
4.5,5,"Boyfriend and I rented this van for 7 days with unlimited miles.  It was the best thing we could have done to explore the national parks.  We visited Zion, Bryce, Canyonlands, Dead Horse St. Park, Arches, Upper/Lower Antelopes, Lake Powell, Horseshoe Bend, and the Grand Canyon.  We loved the fun style of the van and driving it was easy enough.  It was home for 7 days and it took us on a 1,650 mi adventure.  The customer service of the LV Campervans was exceptional.  Mack and his coworker (Aussie lady, can't remember her name) were so super helpful showing us around the van and how everything works.  They also have a stash of things campers have left behind so we took some leftover olive oil, salt, toilet paper, etc.  Mack also gave us a lantern to use and bring back to him.  They lend things out which is nice, since we flew in from NJ and had to buy mostly all of our supplies at Walmart, which gets expensive especially when you have to buy two big coolers, dish soap, paper towels, and other camping supplies.  The van was super roomie, and for the long distances (5 hours of driving) one of us would just sleep in the back during the drive.  The bed was extremely wide & comfortable.  Only qualm I have about the van is it gets HOT.  We had to sleep some nights w all doors wide open.    Definitely and highly recommend if you are going on a roadtrip.  Thanks for everything Mack!"
4.5,5,"We rented an Escape Campervan and used a Groupon coupon (before you get a Groupon do some research on if it will actually save costs for you), for spring break. We traveled with two adults and one 10 year old (who slept in the sleeper on top of the van). There was a lot of space and the pull out bed in the van is actually very comfortable. It was our first time traveling like this and we really liked it and will probably do it again. At times it was hard to find camping spots in the area where we traveled (Zion and Bryce) so do some research beforehand. Customer service at Escape Campervans was great. I lost my fitbit in the van, and they made sure to go back and look and actually found it. The week that we traveled in (end of March) was very cold, it was actually freezing and snowing, a bit too cold for the campervan:( But other than that we really recommend Escape Campervans!"
4.5,5,I had one of the best experiences of my life and escape campercans is to thank.all the amenities you need for comfy camping. The staff was extremely friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we had the best trip possible. I will definitely be using them again.
4.5,4,"We had a blast on our trip.  Drove through Death Valley, Grand Canyon, and onto Lake Powell.  The Campervan was stocked with most everything you need, and the bed was more comfortable than it looked.  Slept very well, in fact.  The only reason for the 4 Stars was I felt that the power steering could have been tighter, and it did take a while for the refrigeration drawer to cool down.  Would definitely use the CamperVan Again."
4.5,5,"We rented an Escape Campervan from the Las Vegas location for a quick weekend trip up to Cathedral Gorge National Park and a scenic drive thru Utah and Arizona.  I couldn't be happier with the experience.  The van was loaded with all of the essentials...cups, plates, pans, silverware, bedding.  The solar-powered fridge was perfect to hold all of our food and kept everything cold throughout out trip.  A small space heater was also included - at night the temp dipped down to about 40 degrees (F), so we left the heater on in the van for about 20 minutes to get the chill out, and then we were set for the night under the two provided comforters (and a woven wool blanket that we brought along).  The van itself handled well, aside from the steering feeling somewhat loose; this made it a little bit difficult to keep on the road when we encountered a windstorm with strong gusts.  We pulled over for a bit to allow the storm some time to pass and organized our things.   The van was ideal for a few days on a campground, and the back-door ""kitchen"" was perfect to make simple meals and coffee.  We will definitely be renting again from Escape and look forward to our next (hopefully longer) trip!"
4.5,4,"The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the poor condition of the vehicle we rented. We had some mechanical problems on the road and the car itself was old and run down. However, they were great at taking care of us, making everything as easy and smooth as possible in getting the car repaired (they arranged everything, told us where to go, and paid for it over the phone). Even the repair shops mentioned how easy they were to work with.
And once we returned they refunded us a nice chunk of our rental fee, for the days lost and general inconvenience. 
We will definitely rent from them again, especially knowing that the model that gave us trouble is being phased out. 
Great concept and nice people. These vans make road tripping so easy."
4.5,5,"I can't say enough good things about our Escape adventure to Zion this past week. The van put up with a lot of unpaved roads, had surprisingly good fuel efficiency, and provided a very comfortable sleeping experience. I'm already looking into booking my National Park excursion with Escape. Thanks for everything!"
4.5,5,"It was my first campervan experience but I am now a zealot. I LOVED it - no tent to worry about in the morning, comfortable bed, we could be flexible on our destinations since no hotel reservations, cold beer 24x7 thanks to the solar fridge drawer, we could sleep at remote trail heads and get out before the crowds, hot lunch on the stove when we needed ... 

Read their website - most info there and gracious when I called to ask questions. We were going to higher elevations so I brought an extra down throw but we would have been fine with the extra blanket we picked up in the office. They have shelves of food left by previous renters and extra blankets and other items to take for free in the office.

We parked in national forests for free, sometimes managed to snag a national park campsite reservation and/or first come first served spot (parks are BOOKED - you need an alternative plan) but usually found an RV park near a park gate and enjoyed their warm showers. 

Recommendations
- add the table and a solar shower to your rental package. Nice to sit down for your meal plus many park campgrounds have no shower which got ... smelly. 
- rent the larger Ford size. It has higher clearance if you want to go into the back country and a king size bed if you have an expected guest (our son did not read the email saying to bring his own tent!) 

Customer service was great at pick up and drop off, van exactly as promised and everything we needed included in the rental price."
4.5,5,We had a great experience in our campervan touring southern Utah for 9 days.  We had some minor hiccups (they forgot to give us a ladder for the top bed) but climbing up became fun for the kids.  I highly recommend using Escape Campervan.
4.5,5,"This was a great little company to have discovered. The guy that checked us in was very knowledgeable about what places to see and about how the van works. Checked everything is in working condition before giving us the keys. Gave us a lot of disclaimers, but we appreciated the honesty so there are no surprises or hidden costs. 

I have no negative thing to say about the experience and doing business with this company. 

Only thing I can say to improve the experience is maybe add a few more convenient things to the van, like dishwashing detergent and dish washing foam. Also to check if there is water for the kitchen in the back before giving the van for lease. 

Just little stuff. 


I enjoyed every minute in the van and I hope you guys don't lose that helpful easy going vibe! I will definitely consider renting again, if you guys open a location on the east coast as well!"
4.5,5,"Great experience with Escape Campervans! Everything we needed was included with the van rental and the service was fantastic. From the booking process to picking up and returning, everything was smooth and the service was done with a smile. The van was in perfect condition, gas mileage was as good as could possibly be expected, and we had no problems throughout our week long, 900ish mile journey. When we had a question along the way and called, someone picked up immediately to answer our question. Highly recommend Escape Campervans!"
4.5,5,"We had a great experience with our Escape Campervan. The Las Vegas staff were very helpful. We rented a Maverick model, it's 17ft long, and it drives like a large van that fortunately has a proximity alert beep for tight parking lots. We were out for 15 days during the end of September and early October in the south and north  rims of the Grand Canyon, at Bryce Canyon, and at Zion National Park, staying at the park campgrounds. 

We brought our own 20 degree double sleeping bag, which really helped on the nights and mornings when temperatures dropped into the 40 and 30 degree range. The duvet that Escape Campervans provides is not enough to keep warm with when it gets that cold.

Bring an extra battery charger because our van did not have a solar powered charging station. Also be sure to park on the most level part of your campsite as you can. Otherwise one of you can end up sleeping in a wheel well. 

With those caveats, we are already planning our next adventure with Escape Campervans, and we heartily recommend that you consider them for your next outdoor expedition."
4.5,5,"I can't say enough good things about this company - the staff were friendly and knowledgeable and the van was comfortable and easy to drive.  We used it in lieu of a rental car as there were 4 of us driving through Death Valley and on to San Francisco.  It enabled us to have an excellent trip as we had loads of room, were able to stop anywhere and make coffee or a full meal.  We will definitely book it again."
2.5,5,"I'm in the market for an RV. I found La Mesa RV very friendly and nice. No pressure sales. I was able to walk around and look at various RVs. Salesmen were visible and easily ready when I had a question. 

Today they even had a special barbecue for customers. I had my kids help me look at various models and very nice and open environment.

Your staff was very friendly. Your staff answered all my questions. When I am ready to purchase La Mesa RV has risen to the top of my list as the place to go."
2.5,1,"Tried again. This time I called about a unit on the website. Was told that it is not at the local lot and in another part of the state. I ask when will there be one locally to look at. The reply was for me to come fill out the paperwork for the ""unseen unit"". That was the only way to ""see it"". This place is way to aggressive and they just don't seem to get it. Based on this page as well as what I have read I am now officially done with them. I am happy to report that out of all the dealers I have spoken to none have been as pushy/aggressive as La Mesa RV. Such a major turn off."
2.5,1,"Avoid at all cost!  They are great at sales (bought new 2016) but that's where it ends!  The service department is dishonest.  They lied to me about services completed.  They accidentally punched a hole in one of my storage compartment doors and refused to take responsibility and then they trashed the carpet (muddy/dirty shoes)- they ""cleaned it"" but the stains remain and they refuse to correct the issue.  The service manager makes excuses for the staff and refuses to take any responsibility.  The customer service manager is friendly but provided no value.   I now drive an extra 190 miles to get my coach serviced at 3Ts RV Products in Lake Havasu AZ and it is worth it!    Learn from my mistake and avoid La Mesa RV!!"
2.5,1,"I wouldn't buy a $0.05 widget from these guys. They obviously think everyone that walks in has no idea what they are doing and will take you for a ride before you buy a ride. I've taken my business to other dealerships, MHSRV and Lazy Days RV and got much better service, treatment and price."
2.5,1,"If I could give a minus 5 to this service department,in Mesa AZ, I would do so. Sure wish that I had read all the reviews posted on the net. prior to dropping off our fifth wheel. Took in my fifth wheel because the refrigerator was not working. They charged me $421, only after I put up such a fuss for the $541 bill that the bill was decreased by someone who overheard the conversation (apparently a manager) for diagnosing NOTHING. Picked up the RV, and the frig still does not work. The service rep was Craig. My recommendation is you go across the street. La Mesa is a HUGE RIP OFF! They are unethical and rude."
2.5,5,"We have purchased a new Fleetwood Bounder motor coach from La Mesa RV in Mesa Arizona and are trilled with the size, style, and color, of our new coach.
The real reason for this review is to commend La Mesa RV for putting together an organization thats makes it an enjoyable experience in shopping for a motor coach.  For example: our sales advisor was Don Pickering who provided all the information we needed.  He made us feel very comfortable; he was honest in his approach to financial limitations and worked hours and days (even on his day off) to help us reach our goal. Few employees make the effort that Don made to assure us of complete satisfaction. All of the La Mesa staff were very courteous and friendly, which speaks volumes for La Mesa's business philosophy.

Mr. Pickering introduced us to Larry Irvin, who acted as our financial advisor. Larry worked tirelessly to obtain the best interest rate he  could for us.  After several attempts he was successful in getting us a great interest rate.

There were so many staff members who helped during our visit, it would be difficult to mention them all, but Don Pickering is one we want to highlight as one of the most outstanding sales advisors we have met.

What a marvelous group of people working at La Mesa RV.  From the time we entered the front door until we left in our new purchase, we were treated with exceptional courtesy and respect."
2.5,1,"300% mark up on screws!!!!! Have I got your attention? Let me start from the beginning. I was out of the country for a year with the military and the trailer wasn't being used. Upon my return I took my 2004, 33FT 5Th wheel to La Mesa RV (Mesa, AZ). My goal was to have them inspect the unit from bumper to bumper and identify anything that needed to be addressed, specifically on the operational side. I was told by the service advisor, Jose Campos that the 30 point inspection covered everything that I was looking for and the cost was $300.00. I also identified some cosmetic items, that over the years the AZ sun has taken a toll on. $2607.70 later my unit was ready to be picked up and enjoyed. A week later I was on my way to San Diego, CA when I stopped in Yuma, AZ to refuel. To my dismay, I looked between the wheels and saw the leaf spring shackle hanging on the ground. Something that was supposedly addressed in the initial 30 point inspection. *Shout Out to RV WORLD in Yuma, AZ. They were able to squeeze me in and make the repair so that I could enjoy the rest of my trip. If you ever get in a bind and need assistance with your RV/Trailer in Yuma, AZ I highly recommend them. After e-mailing Phil Bergeron (service manager), letting him know how disappointed I was in that the 30 point inspection wasn't conducted thoroughly , Phil offered to refund me the cost of the inspection $300.00.    Unfortunately the NIGHTMARE with La Mesa RV doesn't end there. Once arriving to my destination and fully hooking up the trailer, my son comes to me and says there is water spraying all over the bathroom. I thought to myself, how is this possible, I just had the trailer serviced. Clearly if there was an issue, this would have been identified in the 30 point inspection and I would have paid to have repaired. At that point I called Phil to see why certain items that they list on their 30 point inspection, could have gone undetected. He again apologized stating that he believes that the technician had not done a thorough job during the initial inspection, they would refund the cost of the inspection and was hoping that once I returned to the valley I would bring the unit in so that they could make matters right. After spending a week in San Diego, not being able to use the toilet, I returned to the valley and took the unit to La Mesa RV to see what ""right"" means to them. I had a few conditions (1) that the individual (service tech) that performed the first inspection didn't work on it and (2) I wanted to deal with a different service writer. ROUND TWO of the second inspection. Introducing Bill Kuck (service advisor). I specifically requested Bill because when I went to pick up the trailer the first time, Jose wasn't available, Bill specifically noticed items that were missed during the initial inspection/repairs and wanted to make it right. Bill called (06/21/16) and asked if I was sitting down. Once I said yes he proceeded to tell me that I was looking at another $3000.00 to fix everything identified during the second inspection and I do mean everything. This time they put their best tech on it and he went over it with a fine tooth comb. I asked Bill to send me over a line item quote showing the cost and all items that were being addressed. While he was doing that, I went back and looked at my old invoice. That's when it came to my attention regarding the EXCESSIVE mark up on parts. I'm not sure if I was giving this sheet by mistake from the front counter when I picked up my unit the first time but it shows La Mesa RV's cost, plus what I was charged for any particular item. Here we go (1) Part Number ZL933066 Maxx Air, their cost ($21.90) my price ($41.99) a 91.7% markup (2) Part Number ZL501LSW-1 Dicor Sealant, their cost ($5.25) my price ($11.99) a 128.3% markup (3) Part Number ZL44-1208 #12X1 IN Screw, their cost (.24¢) my cost (.96¢) a 300% markup (4) Part Number ZL422-PW-A Dust Plug Rubb, their cost ($2.79) my cost ($6.99) a 205.2% markup (5) ZLB120 Cable Hatch, their cost ($3.79) my cost ($11.99) a 216.3% markup (6) WI058808-01-700 Water Fill Cap, their cost ($3.20) my cost ($9.99) a 212.1% markup (7) ZL24830 Jack, their cost ($97.00) my cost ($164.99) a 70% markup. La Mesa RV has stated, that if I decide to go ahead and fix all the items that were identified in the second 30 point inspection, that they would reduce the labor rate from $130.00hr to $85.00hr. Trust me which I appreciate. However when I brought up the excessive markup on parts to Bill, he simply stated ""that's business"". *side note: On my way back from San Diego, I had noticed that the La Mesa RV, Yuma location is no longer in business. Maybe, just maybe, that people found out there was another business (referenced above) down the street selling parts without such excessive markup and La Mesa RV, Yuma had to close their doors. Not enough space to continue the rant how horrible this place is. Take your business elsewhere."
2.5,5,We went there with a budget and particular type of used 5th wheel we wanted. Prior to going to LaMesa RV we looked everywhere with no luck. Ethan helped us at LaMesa RV and he took the time for us to get one.  He looked for weeks and he found one we fell in love with.  We are very please with it! He did all the work and we just had to go look when he found it. Prior to our purchase Ethan sent pictures to us through email and we said no to a lot of them. Ethan never gave up and he did find one.  We are so happy and recommend Ethan to everyone.
2.5,5,"My experience was quite different from the other reviews. La Mesa was the fifth or sixth dealership my wife and I went to and we enjoyed the experience. Our salesman John was on loan from one of their CA dealerships and he was great. This is our first coach so we needed to be educated.  John was patient and walked us through with no pressure, financing with Sarah no pressure and so far working with Craig in service has been very smooth.  Craig's been accommodative as we're just now locating a truck to haul it out.  I also like that they have a no to low haggle policy with reasonable numbers posted on coaches versus other dealers that post 30-40% more on theirs."
2.5,1,Buyers Beware!!! Buy here if you so desire but my reason for only 1 star is the Colorado Adventures certificate that comes along with a purchase. Wish we would have done our research before being sucked in to the scam. Having to sell our RV now due to my husbands health and are stuck paying for something we can't use for the next 2.5 years. (Which means a lot on military retirement)
2.5,1,"I am a full time RVer, which means I live in my 40' Phaeton. I popped a leak in my gray tank which puts it way above routine on my ""emergency repair scale"". I called La Mesa RV in Mesa, AZ to try and get an ASAP appointment for the repair. After giving my description of the problem spiel to the receptionist, she said ""Dominic"" from the service department would call me ""right back"". 2 hours later, no call back. I called again and after giving my spiel again, the receptionist took my message again and said ""Dominic"" would call me. After about 15 minutes ""Dominic"" called me. I gave my spiel a third time, stressing the ""full-time RVer"" part and my need for an ASAP appt. ""Dominic"" said they were booked for 2 weeks out, but then asked if I would hold to see if he could find time sooner. He put me on hold. 22 minutes & 34 seconds later the receptionist picked up the line and asked if she could help me. I told her I was on hold for ""Dominic"" for over 20 minutes & she said he was out on the lot with a customer. I thanked her & hung up. I wouldn't care if they had stellar work quality or not, customer service is absolutely terrible. I give them zero stars!"
2.5,1,"La Mesa does well on the sales part at least that's why we all bought from them I think.  The La Mesa facility in Mesa, AZ is horrible on service.  My brand new coach was there over 4 months last year - not fixed correctly upon return.  Spent 4 mos in it last summer and it sat another 3.5 months at LaMesa in Mesa, AZ still not fixed right.  I plan to fix everything myself & sell it I am done.  I would not do business with La Mesa again in this lifetime.

They smile, they promise & screw you without even giving you a kiss each & everytime.  I learned, won't deal with them again ever.  

Perhaps when I sell the coach I can't get serviced I will become the social media B**ch and post everywhere of my experiences right now I don't have time to mess with them but I will."
2.5,1,"Several friends along with my husband and I went into look at high end diesel motorhomes. We were greeted by salesman driving a golf cart ( overweight, middle age, light hair).  He was extremely rude and condescending.   Yes we made a wrong  turn into the service area.  A good salesman would have asked us how he could help us not be an ass.  Our friends were ready and able to afford an expensive motorhome. Lost their business and ours too. Hopefully the management will read this and either retrain or fire the employee."
2.5,5,"Greatest Company I Ever Had Pleasure of Working With!!!

They treated my mom & dad like family.. I will never forget that!!  

They got a great trade in value and an awesome 2015 pre-owned motorhome.

Call me anytime for any questions..

2.5,1,"This afternoon my wife and I and two other couples went to La Mesa RV to look at a 2013 Monanco Diplomat.  All of us own recreational vehicles and one couple was interested in purchasing this one as an up grade.  We drive in the lot that normally has the RV's in it and discovered that many of them had been sent to an RV show.  We drove to a unfenced area where several RV's were parked to look at them.  We had an employee chase us down in a golf cart and in a rude and unfriendly tone tell us to turn around and get out of the lot we were in.  He said ""if you could have read the signs, you would know you are not suppose to be back here.""  As it turns out there were no signs where we came in, because there was no fence or gate.  If he would have shown some courtesy or asked us why we were there, instead of being rude and acting like an a--, they may have made a sale.  As it is none of us will ever purchase something from them and we will make sure our friends look elsewhere. This was the worst service and interaction by a salesperson (who knows he could have been the owner) I have ever met.  With service and employees like this, no wonder La Mesa RV went out of business in Dublin, California and moved out here."
2.5,3,"Went there to get educated about motor coaches. Good and bad, was given an introductory your, then left on my own to wander the yard. When I happened upon someone looking they were given a lot more info about the coaches. I have lots of questions about use and maintenance. Wish I had a better experience. 

Service dept reviews make me nervous about this place."
2.5,1,"Great location, good selection of inventory - but as for honesty, transparency and doing the right thing this place is terrible. 

My wife and I stopped in to browse this past Saturday and Douglas came out to greet us. I told him what we were looking for a class C in the range of $40-65k something that will hold value so that we could trade it in in a couple years on a used diesel pusher. 

He tells us that they just got in a 2008 Diesel Pusher that still needed detailed it was pretty dirty and needs some repairs - but that they had priced it at $47,999. 

We went and took a look and it was exactly what we were looking for! Sold. Ah not so fast. 

We go in do all the credit stuff, work out all the deal points. So we are hanging out waiting on paperwork and the manager comes in, sits us down and tells us that they made a mistake. 

Derrick the manager claims that they transfixed the numbers on the unit - it isn't $47,999 but $74,999 and that the unit being it had been in inventory for 192 days was suppose to be reduced to $72,999. He apologized and asked us if we would like to proceed with the purchase at the list price - $72,999!!!

As you can imagine we were pissed. Seriously I just wasted 2 hours of my time, did all the paperwork and they wait till the last minute to tell us they screwed up. 

I get it people are human they make mistakes - but I wanted that coach. So you offer it to me at retail. You screwed up, it was a mistake I get it. I wouldn't expect them to lose $25k but they could have made a reasonable counter. ""Sorry guys we screwed the pooch. Here is what the book on the coach is - we were going to price it at $72k but if you still want it we will do it at $65k plus give you a warranty and free oil changes for a year"". Anything. But nope take it or leave it.

As we were leaving I realized something. The coach was dirty, needed a bit of body work and some minor repairs - heck it just came on the lot and they hadn't had a chance to detail it or repair it yet ......... but remember Derrick the manager told me that the unit was in inventory for 192 days. I went back into the dealership and confronted him. His story is that it did just come in but was in wholesale for the past 7 months in Davis. YEAH right. 

Buyer beware!"
2.5,4,"Went in there to start looking for a travel trailer, not planning on purchasing, but to start looking and getting an idea, etc. I am leaving this review to say that the sales people were not pushy, which is very important for someone like me lol
We had 2 gentlemen approach us (Greg and Ethan i believe) and they were very informative, answered our questions and left us to keep browsing. It was VERY helpful since it will be our first time buying one of these things.

Not sure about service or sales since we did not purchase, but we will definitely keep this place in mind when we decide what we want lol"
2.5,1,The wife and I were shopping for a motorhome and stopped by La Mesa RV in Phoenix. We had a salesman that was arrogant and would make negative comments. He was the typical used car salesman. It makes me never want to go back to La Mesa. Companies work so hard to promote a positive image and then they hire unprofessional people to meet customers. La Mesa you need to really look at your sales guys.
2.5,5,We had the good fortune to work with Myles when we stopped by to check out some trailers. He listened to what we were looking for and found something that exactly met our needs. It was such a pleasant experience from start to finish and Myles made that possible.
2.5,5,"We had an amazing experience purchasing our RV from La Mesa. We are out of state buyers and knew just what we wanted. The sales and management team did an excellent job answering detailed questions and helping us get confident to make the purchase from afar. They also didn't harass us, which I really appreciated. 

The delivery team was amazing. We arrived a day early and with just a few hours notice, the entire team hustled to meet our new delivery schedule. We spent a night in the lot getting familiar with the coach and had all our questions answered. 

The RV business is so busy right now, I was impressed they could adjust to our schedule so easily. While the RV is not perfect (nothing ever is). It is always a manner of not 'if it will break, but when it will break'.  We did extensive research on warranties and did not feel any pressure by finance to purchase their product. 

In reading the bad reviews I feel like expectations are a little skewed for many buyers/repair. It takes time to get parts, all RV's break (especially the new ones that are not delivered from the factory with everything working). We bought used and knew we would have some tweaks here and there. None of that is the dealers issue. Rather it is an industry wide issue with new RV's almost always having issues. 

We are very happy with our experience and happy to recommend them to others."
2.5,5,"CARDINAL'S STADIUM RV SHOW - My husband and I visited the RV show at the Cardinal's stadium this weekend. We have been looking for a smaller trailer for a while with no luck. Looked at the first trailer and met Gabe. The trailer we wanted had been sold already but he had looked at the stock at the dealerships and found us exactly what we were looking for. The process was simple, easy and painless! Thank you Gabe for your help today. God bless and go Titans!"
2.5,1,"This afternoon my wife and two other couples headed over to La Mesa RV to look at high end Diesel Coaches. We all currently own high end units, but two of us are in the market to upgrade. Moreover, we all have purchased a number of RV's over the years and have had a variety of buying experiences, good and bad. Well today we never even made it out of the car before we got a double barrel blast of how this dealer does business. We drove into the lot and were apparently driving in an area that was supposedly posted with signs telling us not to enter, when some jerk off of a manager chased us down in a golf cart and told us we had no business being in that lot.  He informed us we needed to read the signs and sat there until we turned around and got out of the lot. Well we retraced our path and there were no such signs.

You would think he would have asked us if he could help us find something etc. before coming unglued and potential customers. Totally uncalled for, rude, and without a doubt a snapshot of what was to come with these guys. 

Bottom line, my wife and I will take our business elsewhere and we all will spread the word in our various RV groups, not to shop at La Mesa."
2.5,1,"Well I guess I should have checked Yelp before bringing my RV in for an insurance claim.  Lamesa has has had my RV for over a month now and have yet to provide a complete estimate to complete the repairs.  I just keep getting excuse after excuse from Bill Kuck in service about why he hasn't finished the estimate.  I sent him an email yesterday  saying this after he said he would have the complete estimate that day, ""This was 2 weeks ago Bill. Please just let me know if you guys are too busy to do the work and I will take it somewhere else!
This is getting ridiculous!"" .
This is his response ,
""sorry i have been out for two days , if you want to come and get it , go ahead.""

I don't want to pick it up, I want you to do what you promised!  Is that too much to ask!
I'm done with them and my wife and I are off to pick it up today and we will try to find a more professional company for our RV needs!

Very Disappointed!!!!!

Update. Went and picked up the RV and they would not release it to me unless I paid them $400 for doing a quote for me.  Bill Kuck explained that if I get the work done there he will credit me the $400.  I've never heard of this before but hey when you deal with crooked people this is what you get.

Please stay away from these guys!"
2.5,5,"This year, we purchased a new Thor Vegas from La Mesa RV. And, like with any RV, I had a few warranty issues to resolve after our first time out. So I setup an appointment with a gentlemen by the name of Mike Rios, and that call started of one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. Mike walked me through the process, kept me informed via text or phone, and had my RV back before it was due. When I arrived to pick it up, Mike had everything cleaned up, A/C was running, and walked me through every repair they made. 
If you EVER go to LaMesa for any type of service, call Mike. You won't be disappointed."
2.5,5,"My wife and i had a very enjoyable experience at the Mesa location of La Mesa RV. The sales experience provided by Deacon and Rob Pine was fantastic. The vehicle was inspected and delivered by Matt and Nate and they also did an awesome job, making sure that no detail was left unattended to. Simply an easy and fun experience picking out and picking up our new home on wheels."
2.5,1,La Mesa RV sells all New RV's in an as is condition BEWARE. I am in a law suit with this company for the worst purchase experience of my life. I never write bad reviews always good. These guys smile while they do not back their product. I purchased a quarter of a million dollar product from La Mesa RV and they blamed everyone else. Never do business with these people. When everything is good they are their and as soon as it is bad the disappear... WORST PURCHASE OF MY LIFE... I would give them negative stars if I could ...
2.5,1,"Awful experience that never ends with service. It has been 4 months, and i am still trying to get my RV warranty repairs done.  Terrible communications.  You will always need to call in if you want to know something.  And good luck getting that call back when you leave a message.  They are completely disorganized and not customer focused.  Sad that I am actually looking forward to getting out of warranty for the small repairs.  It's just not worth the hassle.  I want to work with the smaller mobile companies that do a great job."
2.5,1,One star is only because they have good buying power for RV selection. We purchased a high end diesel pusher from La Mesa. Their delivery and support was extremely bad. They had apparently used our coach at RV shows and it showed. They promised to take care of the repairs but failed to do so. We ended up driving the coach 1500 miles back to the dealer. A major inconvenience and a costly trip.   I would never recommend them for anything. I have talked with many other buyers from many of their other locations and all have been as disappointed is I was.
2.5,5,"Traveling to Mesa in our Class C RV for a 2 month vacation, we just thought about upgrading to a Class A sometime in the future.  We looked at several other dealers just for the heck of it, and came back to La Mesa RV in Mesa, AZ to do a serious look.  We were in the market for a pre-owned coach, and found the best one ever with only 4,000 miles.  It was in beautiful shape, hardly even used at all.  Mac King was our salesperson assisted by Ron Logan.  There was not any hard pressures given and they really listened to what we wanted.  The buying part was a breeze, but the best part was with Garry in Service!  We brought our old rig to the parking lot, and easily exchanged the contents with the new rig.  We spent the night in it to make sure there weren't any problems before we drove it off the lot.  Garry was so accommodating knowing we were not residents of AZ but from Texas.  He got his team on the very few things that needed attention.  We came back to the RV resort and a week later we had a few small issues that needed addressing before we made our trip back to Texas.  We made an appointment, and they were on-time, friendly, and always asking us if there was anything else they could do, and the repair was made to our satisfaction.  As a YELP user, we read the previous comments regarding Service at La Mesa RV, and truth be told, we were a bit wary.  But none of the negative showed its face, only positive.  We wish La Mesa RV could move to our home in Texas for future maintenance and service!"
2.5,1,"These guys are crafty, dishonest and have no idea how to deliver good customer service. You can't believe a word they say and you'll spend weeks waiting for someone to give you a straight answer. Take your business somewhere else. Don't reward their lack of integrity."
2.5,1,"I just came back from La Mesa. The CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE!!!! Unlike Ed M. we were completely ignored. We checked out a few RVs while the salesman assisted another customer. When he was finished and we were getting out of one of the coaches, the salesman turned around and said, ""make sure you close the door on your way out."" He didn't even say hello or ask if we needed help. We kept walking around the lot when we noticed 2 more salesmen pointing at us. Neither seemed like they were approaching us so I moved on. On the way back to the car a male and female employee just sat and watched us drive away. Makes me wonder....Too bad I can't give them 0 stars."
2.5,4,Purchased a 2018 rv from La Mesa and all the sales and service personnel were courteous and helpful.  The Mesa office worked with us on trading in our current unit and pricing the new one fairly.  The service department made sure the new unit was ready as promised and all paperwork was completed.
2.5,1,"I only gave it a 1 because I couldn't give them 0.
The worst service ever!!!!! They don't call you back, I left a message on a Friday to please call me an the next Friday still no call. This happened repeatedly, for several weeks
Their service tecs and dept just won't communicate with you!!  I'd even ask the phone operator, just ask this question an said you can call me back with a yes or no, I couldn't even get an answer that way
They also fixed coach, but knocked off bottom couch panel an just laid on couch, didn't bother to put back on.
AWEFUL, AWEFUL, AWEFUL
A PS called their corp office in San Diego the customer service took care of problem in 30 minutes an didn't even say I'm sorry or apologize for the hassle.
They love to sell RVs but service is crummy an secondary
Rv has been setting since getting it back , since a medical problem doesn't permit us to go away for the summer.
My husband runs it every week an one week slides out go in , next week slides outs go out,  Now the slide they fixed to the tune of 1200.00 doesn't really want to move . Its hard to get it in an out.  Now what do I do 1200.00 down a rat hole an I can't an won't take it back to that place, if they were the only place on earth to go"
2.5,1,"We went to an RV show with these guys at Sacramento's Sleep Train Arena.  We were extremely pressured.  We tried to leave several times.  they put us in a air conditioned motor home so we could get out of the heat. The whole time they sent in salesmen who rambled to keep us there.  We kept telling them we wanted to go home and sleep on it.  The finance guy came in and really put the pressure on saying he had to have something, it sounded like he was going to lose his job. We finally signed a contract.  Mind you they were closed.  It was that late by the time we left. We felt coerced.  We were exhausted and I was out of it from the heat.  The next day we went to cancel and were told there is no cooling off period in California. 

We ,leaned that California Vehicle Code states that each sales office, cubicle etc requires a sign at least 8"" high and 10"" wide that clearly states, ""THERE IS NO COOLING-OFF PERIOD UNLESS YOU OBTAIN A CONTRACT CANCELLATION OPTION"".   We are still working on getting the contract cancelled.  

If you were at the RV show and felt like we did, please write a review, report them to DMV and whatever it takes so we can stop their unethical practices."
2.5,1,MY story pretty much goes along with the rest.  My brand new motorhome has been in their shop for over a month which is longer than I have had it.  They were fixing numerous minor issue.  Never received a call in a week as promised.  Called them and they said they forgot to order the parts and it would be three more weeks.  Al this place cares about is the sale and then it is screw you.
2.5,5,I was at the RV show in Scottsdale. We ran into a salesman named Gabe Knight. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. He represented La Mesa RV well!
2.5,5,"WE PURCHASED a 42 ft fifth wheel Luxe by Augusta a week ago from LaMesa RV on line from Mark. The transaction went smoothly.  Don the sales manager was very personable and helpful. We had a generator and washer and dryer installed. .the Technician that installed these was very polite and professional and did a great job. Garry Cotton the walk thru specialist was outstanding. .he paid special attention to all the details and went up and above as well as Roman .Everyone was very nice we worked with..also Leslie the finance manager, Dawn in parts, Memo the service advisor and Sherry the receptionist. IT is nice to go somewhere and get SERVICE and also be treated NiCE...Thank you so much. NOTHING in this world is perfect and theres a few issues like always...its to be expected with anything. YAL DID A GREAT JOB...Rodney and Donna Manis"
2.5,1,Wow!!! Unbelievable the customer service there. We purchased a 2016 toy hauler at the expo they had in phoenix. Everything was great!!!! But when it came time to pick it up..Nothing but the run around and rudeness. .For what you spend there I would expect a lot more. Find another place to go.If I could cancel my contact I would. Still have not picked it up..It was supposed to be ready today. But no word from sales person. Way to crush a dream La Mesa!!!
2.5,5,My wife and I have purchased a new trailer it's a Keystone Outback model we love it La Mesa RV has very good service good sales people and when I die again I will come back there thank you
2.5,1,"I attended the RV show last weekend in Phoenix and was greatly disappointed.  There were many sales people on the floor and in the two hours I was there, not one approached me and asked if I had any questions or needed any help.  I walked out and will take my business elsewhere.  They have to remember that not only are they offering sale prices, but good customer service should come with that."
2.5,1,"Bought a used 2017 Open Range Travel Trailer while at an RV show at the University of Phoenix Stadium and felt pretty good about the whole experience. Sadly it was on a weekend and when Monday came my whole experience went from ok to just plain awful! I was not one that checked yelp reviews prior to dealing with this dealership so it's all my fault of the terrible experiences about to begin! We were dealing with the dealerships finance dept James Harper and then someone else then someone else then back to James etc... every time we spoke with the finance dept the individual didn't know what was asked of us the day or two before then awanted us to resend the needed information immediately so they could forward to ""the bank"" only to be repeated again the next day or whatever. James Harper was very dishonest with us regarding financial options essentially saying they only submit to one bank at a time to supposedly not have extra inquiries on our credit reports. Well the truth is he just didn't care to find the best option on financing interest rates etc. I asked that they rate shop some and was told they would with another lender the next day, well James didn't know I am told every time my credit is ran and 2 days later I called to see when they'd run my report with the second bank. The reply was oh we did that yesterday however when I told I get notified there story changed to, oh we just were swamped and it was just sent to another lender. 

A few days later not having heard from anyone I called and was told that the second lender needed this or that for information so again off to find a fax machine to resubmit all the needed docs. It just never ended until I finally said that I'd had enough and wanted to just get my down payment back and be on my way to find a dealership wanting to sell a trailer. I was very very disappointed with LaMesa in Phoenix. But more upset at myself for not checking reviews of LaMesa prior to dealing with them. 

Now after buying the trailer and finally having it in my driveway I just got a call from the lender saying that they are in need of proof of insurance which again was submitted when we were signing our final contract. Again these guys are simply clueless. 

One last thing. Since I bought a used trailer I figured that the basic warranty was limited in time if even available and so was under the impression to getting an extended warranty. Well now I know that the trailer I bought built by Highland Ridge comes from the factory with a 2 year full warranty with no deductible whereas the extended warranties have some form of deductible. Go figure I again wasn't told everything about the trailer. 

These folks are just plain dishonest and non caring about you the customer in any way shape or form. The ol verbiage used to be that your warranty was as long as they saw your tail lights but these folks don't so much as offer that security with your purchase. 

Please before you buy anything from these folks, do your homework and read any reviews you can. I didn't and am paying dearly for it!!"
2.5,2,I ordered a new Tiffin Motorhome from here.  First I believe they told me a tall tale about a big hike in prices after the first of the year.  I have not seen that to be true.  Next customer service is surely lacking.  I had to call/text them for updates.  Then they told me I should just call Tiffin direct.  Now I will say that Tiffin was great and responded and even gave me a production schedule.  I had mentioned several times when I wanted to pick up my RV and it was like sure until the RV came in on 27Feb18 to the dealer.  I wanted to get it on 2 Mar 18 so I could have a week in the RV before going out.  AND I already paid for an RV site for 8 nights and  now I will only use for 3 nights as now I am not getting it until 6 Mar 18.  I have been RVing for over 30 years and bought 8 RVs and this has been the worst customer service so far.  Hope things go better if I need servicing after the fact.
2.5,2,negotiated a great deal.  Went to pick up the fifth wheel on our scheduled date.  It wasn't ready.  More to come.  I hope the rating and review goes up.  Stay tuned.
2.5,1,"Just left the mesa location. We're looking for a nice, higher end TT.  The sales guy that ""helped"" us kept checking his watch, vaguely answered simple questions with answers like ""un huh"".  The selection was poor and disorganized.  We just felt like we shouldn't even be there.  The only question he asked me wss ""when do you want to buy""..my answer, not any time soon from you. Too bad, I'm a cash buyer for the right TT.  Just felt like we were wasteing his time, but the truth is...we wasted ours going to la mesa rv."
2.5,1,"Very disappointed in the quality of workmanship and customer service. Had our motorhome in a few times and nothing was done under $1000 each visit. The last visit, gave me concern due to the fact that I paid for work to be done and the work was not completed correctly or done at all. They were in the grill and the airconditioning hose was disconnected when I got it back. The sound bar that they reinstalled (that was working), now doesn't work. I brought to the attention of Jose, Tech agent in charge of my unit. His response was less than helpful. His words were like, ""people always place the blame on service."" Great response for the money spent. I was taken by his response, after becoming a regular customer and paying the type of money I have been charged for work done. When I emailed him that he should be listening and understanding, he basically told me he was and I should be too!!!! Wow. If you have work done here, you better make them show you all work completed and test all items before leaving the premises. I trusted, and got screwed. Don't let it happen to you. Motorhome repairs are costly, but you expect the quality of repairs and customer service to match the costs....   La Mesa lost my business"
2.5,1,"I was disappointed with our call today, (Chuck West and Javier Castro) with you stating you have no ""liability"" to put in my HDMI cable so my new HD tv works with HD.  I would have asked for the cable with the tv replacement,  but it only seemed logical to put in the hd cable with the new tv. Below are listed the details of the purchase, I have held this email since Feb in hopes things would be shown to be not all that bad, but now feel there is a culture of dishonesty and non-disclosure in representing issues with customers, I do not have any trust in anything they do in Tucson.  If you put in my hdmi cables, I would do my annual service there on coach and gen set as well, but now will be doing business across the street at Lazy Days.  I hope you pass on these issues with the Tucson store, I will be telling everyone I see as well to stay away.

Here is what happened with our purchase of a 2006 Phaeton, January 30th, 2012,  our first one with LaMesa, Tucson.  What I really want to know is if this experience is typical, or part of an overall business plan or fraud and deception, or just incompetence.  

When first looking at the coach, I asked the age of the tires, Al said he knew how to read the DOT date codes and went outside the coach to look at the tires, he came back and we were told the tires were 4 years old and thus OK.  

After thinking about this for a few days, I found it hard to believe why the tires would have been replaced only two years after the coach was new,  and asked be shown the DOT code, as it turned out, the tires were 8 years old, the original tires and needed to be replaced, but only because I did not go along with what I was initially told.  

We shared the cost of the new tires, but they should have been replaced on LaMesa.  Was Al wrong, mistaken or misleading us to take the old tires, just would like to know, I have a hard time believing he does not know how to read the dates accurately. 

When our delivery date/walk through was to take place, Feb. 5th, we only had a few items to check on, however, when we got there, the windshield had neither been repaired or replaced as agreed. Upon trying to repair it,  it cracked, so needed to be ordered, making us come back 5 days later to be installed.  During the walk through, the fridge was not working, not on, warm.  They acted surprised, it turned out the module had been sprayed during washing and was tripped, so replaced it, and found that both cooling fans were not working, shouldn't the fridge fans be checked as part of the PDI?.  While removing the fridge to replace the fans, using only two guys to lift the fridge, they dropped it on the wood floor, gouging it, the blanket they put down was filthy and full of sand.  The fridge still only gets down to 40-42 degrees set all night on 8, when it is 65 degrees in the coach,  which makes me question how it will do in the summer heat.  

When we tried to rinse out the black water tank the first time with the internal spray bar, no water would drain out, nothing, I took it back and they said the line was kinked, How did they do a PDI, rinse and test the tank without this line working? As to the fresh water tank, Xavier said they do not sanitize then unless they smell sour but Tom who did the walk through said they did sanitize it, who knows.   The 7.5K generator got an oil change and oil filter, but with 529 hours, they did not change the fuel filter, which is due at 500 hrs,  not having a history on the coach, I ask it be changed as well.  

We had two new TV's installed, replacing the old ones, when we saw them we were shocked, they had taken a piece of plywood, covered it with white carpet and mounted the tv, then screwed the tv and plywood on the outside of the oak cabinet, the whole thing sticking out and additional 4-5 inches into the front walkway, I only wish I had taken pictures,  so they remounted both, but there is no way to access the rear or side to install and HDMI cable for satellite, they said I just need to take it apart and put in the cable myself.  why couldn't a cable be run to the outside when they installed it? now that the TV's are reinstalled, they are flush mounted on the carpet covered plywood and recessed in the cabinet, but there is no air space behind the TV, the owners manual says to have a minimum of 4 inches for heat dissipation, but when I questioned Lee about it, he said it did not matter as the newer LED TV's run cooler,  still, why not follow the book?  Isn't this a fire and liability issue?  Does Lee know more than Samsung as to the heat these create?

Tires- So I have the new tires and ask if they are going to weight the coach, they say no.  I ask, how can you set the tire pressure if you do not know the weight?  Xavier said they just go by the plate in the coach 110 psi,  well, I got it weighted, and for my weight the psi was 75,  If I went with the 110 it would have been hard riding, bad wear, and even ill handling and dangerou"
2.5,1,"Did not keep their promises! They bent over backwards to make the sale, promised to replace a broken sofa on a brand new RV within a couple of weeks. It's now been two months and they still refuse to schedule a time for us to bring it back in to get the sofa installed.
We bought our brand new Winnebago almost two months ago. The day we came to drive it off the lot, the salesman showed us that the pull out couch was broken. They wrote it up, and assured us that if we drive it off the lot they will order a new couch for us and install it in a couple of weeks. It has been 2 months and numerous calls to Nate, the service manager. Two weeks ago, Nate told my husband that we will be called back that day to schedule a time to bring it in. After waiting two weeks we did not get a call. Since our vacation is planned next week we need to have it repaired! I called Nate 2 days ago and he had no recollection of talking with my husband! He said he would talk with his supervisor and call us back that afternoon. Guess what? No call back! Big surprise. This is ridiculous. They got the sale, got our money, so why should they care if they lie to their customers? The sofa was broken and ripped before we even drove it off the lot! They acknowledged it and even ordered a new one for us! Now they won't even return our calls! I guess they figure there's no more money to be made on us so why bother!!"
2.5,5,"I purchased my first brand new motorhome at an RV show from La Mesa in Mesa.  The unit was immaculate and price marked was lower than MSRP.   My buying experience was positive.  However, they back up their products with an outstanding service department.   I have been working with Mike, my service advisor.   He is the kindest, understanding service person I have ever met.  He not only cares about the service of my RV and pays attention to every detail, but he is concerned for me as a person.   I had lost an item on the day of my service and he was genuinely concerned that I find the item.. he has impressed me that there are kind people still in the world and La mesa is blessed to have him in their employ...5 stars! Great buying and service experience."
2.5,1,"Went in to sell our RV on Wednesday at LaMesa... the place we bought it at in 2008. My wife discussed the options with the LaMesa RV Buyer and they (the buyer) they gave her a purchase price number (which originally had a little wiggle room in it) and said let's go in and do the paperwork right now. She said she needed to discuss the numbers with me (as I'm on the loan too). I called them back later that day and asked if they could come up a little in price (given the wiggle room). They got back to me the next day and said no. So I said ok... let's just do the original price offered. I was told they had to again contact their buyer. They got back to me today (Friday) and said they are not interested now as it's to much work and too much of a gamble and too much to fix and we are better off to sell it on Craigslist.

Very shady business interaction. Why are you not holding to your original price offer? Nothing changed on the RV since the day you saw it 1 1/2 days ago. Is this how you treat your customers that purchased a vehicle from you in the past? Definitely very questionable business practices there. Overall I'd say be very aware of interaction with this place. Look for another RV dealer. It will be your best option."
2.5,5,"Gable Knight and his son were amazing in helping find our dream travel trailer-  that fit our needs and our budget. They listened attentively and provided very useful advice. 

Compared to La Mesa's local competitors (Camping World etc.) - we felt comfortable. We felt there were no awkward sale gimmicks, no hidden fees and no slimy back and forth number dealings with managers. 

Picking up the trailer was super amazing, will update on service department - as some items for it were on order"
2.5,2,"I have to say the upfront sales and finance experience went very well. But that's where it ended, the service department is very unresponsive and you keep calling until you get someone to talk to. It took a angry email to the service manager to get a call back. And even then I don't think it was the manager that called back. The 2 stars is only for the upfront sales experience service department would get 0."
2.5,3,"More of the story.  They gave us a walk through on Thursday, despite the fifth wheel not being read:y.  We were PROMISED a delivery Saturday morning, this was on us leaving the check .  They were to clean it up Friday.  This was based on their word, if I paid the balance due, they would have it here.  Stay tuned!

They delivered.  The RV was fixed up as agreed.  We are pleased with our purchase.  I changed my rating to 3 stars.  They would have received all 5 if they had done what they said."
2.5,1,"Went in to look at 5th wheels back in 2012.  2 separate occasions we were greeted by aggressive and uneducated sales people.  The last guy just plain pissed me off, so ended up going down to Tucson.  Whole different world down there.  Very nice, no pressure and even has a free café for customers.  Ended up purchasing $100k RV down there, AND their service is exceptional.  It was worth the extra 250 miles r/t to avoid Mesa."
2.5,5,"These guys were great! We wore out the salesman by looking at EVERYTHING there, and then when we saw a coach online that night, we went back the next day, and our salesman found that coach at the Phoenix dealer - and DROVE OUT THERE WITH US! It was perfect.
Better than that, because we travel with a dog and two cats, we needed a space to put the litter box. I started with the idea of wanting it to be cleaned by being OUTSIDE of the coach, and they designed and manufactured a cat door and tunnel from the bottom inside step directly into the first storage bin. It took my cats about 30 seconds to figure it out.  They should offer that as an option! Good folks all around."
2.5,1,"This is my 2nd complaint. These guys are crooks!! I purchased my toy hauler from them w/ an extended warranty and not once have they been able to help me when Ive had issues. Their service adviser Jose said ""its not my fault you purchased a used coach"". I purchased this warranty because they said ""don;t you want the peace of mind knowing that if any thing ever breaks we'll replace it at no cost?"", I was pressured into purchasing the warranty and 2 months later when we noticed the floor starting to droop we took it to them and they said they couldn't find anything in that area that would cause the drooping BUT did find some other issue that they fixed, however they never did fix the real issue that resulted in our floor to rot (a really large area). They assumed no responsibility and we were left to fix it ourselves.....so much for the warranty. Our most recent experience was the icing on the cake. The TV is broken and Jose gave me the hardest time when I ask if he could help me without having to take the coach in. I was willing to take the TV out myself to take it in and that's when his attitude changed and the hidden fees came out. I can purchase a new TV/DVD combo cheaper than what they want to charge for diagnostic and have to take time off work to drop off and pick up the coach. 

I advise EVERYONE to BEWARE before you do business with them. Once they have your money they are no longer interested in helping you when something breaks....their customer service SUCKS!

I'm in the process of looking into replacing my coach w/ a new one and they will definitely not get my business."
2.5,1,"I have not had any good luck with this dealer especially service I am pretty sure my rv has spent as much time in the shop as I have traveled in it, have been treated badly without any regard to the time I have spent trying to get things fixed. I have had problems with the generator on the unit since I purchased it.  It has been in at least 6 times and had a fuel pump replaced in 2016, and continued having problems. Rv was in shop with them for at least a week and they stated no problems but went to drive it home and it stopped running in less than 5 miles. So I took it back and was told to take it to Cummins dealer, had a great Cummins authorized dealer who was mobile and came to me on 2nd try diagnosed bad carburetor and was authorized thru extended warranty to replace it. But the catch is because La Mesa after telling me to 5ake it to Cummins now wants to charge me a $100 deductible which I am waiting to discuss. Also had a recall on the rv door lock was repaired, then replaced and now having to order another new lock for it. Having to crawl out of the cab section on a class C rv is not fun nor safe. Word to wise don't buy Winnebago or fro La Mesa. Buying 2 lemons in less than 2 years is enough for me."
2.5,5,"Could not find a dealer in California that could meet La Mesa RV on price. Everyone that we interchanged with was excellent! No high pressure sales for upgrades or anything. Everyone was friendly and professional. Had a few small items that needed attention before leaving with our new Class B unit and the staff was quick to handle them. 

IF you are going on a Saturday show up before 1:00 to insure to get some great hot dogs and hamburgers. Again, another freindly staff member.
And if you want popcorn, the receptionist insure that it is always full and will add flavors if desired! 

Can't comment on the service center but in my 30 years of owning every type of RV have never been overwhelmed with any of the big name dealers for service. Just the nature of the industry I think. Not enough trained techs to do all of the work."
2.5,5,"While I was shopping at LaMesaRv a staff member Eric Duperron noticed I was having difficulties with a purchase. Eric stopped what he was doing to assist with my purchase. Eric also arrainged to have a second walk through for us and an awning light that was suppose to come with the 5th wheel installed. Erics  customer service was above and beyond. Staff was extreamly friendly. Technicians explained and confirmed what was being done on our 5th wheel. 
Service Advisor Danny Berrelleza had the work completed with in one hour. Being new to towing a 5th wheel we were on the road with more knowledge and confidence."
2.5,1,"Dishonest and poor customer service in the repair center. Tried to charge us $500+ to order a part to repair our fridge then never actually ordered it or called us. When we called to check on it, the technician was disrespectful. Luckily we took our trailer to a different repair center and found out there was no real issue with the fridge - just needed to be reconnected. Not trustworthy."
2.5,4,"We're from western Canada and finally made it out to the Las Vegas area where we could find finally dump our ""winter antifreeze"" and have water in our coach.  However, we had a myriad of problems that we needed to have serviced.  When we phoned we found  there  was nearly a two week waiting list.  Undaunted we went to the Mesa shop, camped on their doorstep overnight and next morning we sent in my petite wife who managed a tear in her voice pleading for help.
Big Bill from the Service department came out and boomed ""Little lady, let's have a look""  Within minutes he ascertained that the leak streaming down our exterior was really a disconnected fridge water line that led to a non-functioning ice-maker, then advised us that a malfunctioning electronic stove lighter could be installed by ourselves if we purchased a new part (saving us at least $100 precious US dollars (we were paying $1.46 Canadian for ONE US dollar). Finally a troublesome tow-car hitch had to be replaced, necessitating an over-night stay on their  lot with complimentary 50 Amp electricity, while the offending part was shipped from California for next day installation.
Add to this excellent service (bear in mind no wait while an endless stream other RV units descended on this facility )  the fact that complimentary lunch was given without charge.
We'll gladly attest to the A-1 character of LaMesa to anyone"
2.5,1,"First of all why don't you have a 0 star, that's what I'm gunning for. Purchased new Alllegro,2015 from Mesa, location found numerous issues and that's when our nightmare started. They had it 1 Month, with list and pictures of issues, parts needed to be ordered etc. Bill was our first service guy (BIG MISTAKE) if you get him refuse.  Called us said he got paper work back jobs complete. Got there 2 things where done, no parts ordered ( which took another 6 weeks to come in. Then got 2nd service guy after we requested the change. Now we have Craig. Took it in for work Told he didn't work there anymore, and parts still didn't come in. Now we have Dominick. Getting Better.  Parts came in in Janurary from September. Took it in for repairs for washer, furnance and trim work, got it home went into storage, before we left storage, husband checked, propane tank was left on and so was invertor which the fridge would have been running in storage till batteries ran out. Didn't use coach for a month since we went to Hawaii came back 2 weeks later took it out to check out washer and furnance notice our full size fridge had two dents in it. Called talk to Dominic he said we did it, then the manager he said we should have checked that when we picked it up to much time lapsed, we did it. Called San Diego headquarters they called Mesa, got the same bull from manager. Why would we check fridge door for dents when it went in for furnance, washer and trim and slide work????? So we are currently reporting them to BBB, and Consumer Hotline and we belong to an RV Group with 22 rigs and they have already been warned not to do business with these people.  We also contacted Tiffin and let them know what kind of Business is selling and not servicing their product. Bottom Line don't do business with this business there are plenty of RV dealers in Arizona.  Oh by the way this was our second Class A purchased from them so far they got over $340,000 of our retirement money. But the Buck stops here."
2.5,4,"Brandon Ivan was THE best salesman ever.  We totally rate him 5+ for his manners and how he went out of his way for us.  Every one at the dealership was outstanding.  Mickey and Angela did super jobs with finance.  Only reason I didn't score a 5 for la Mesa RV was an incident in service.  We waited 2.5 hours for a trailer hitch part that turned out to have been there all along.  Otherwise... I'll totally recommend you, but with that warning."
2.5,5,Danny in service is the best! Took care of me right away and was super friendly. I will definitely be going back to La Mesa in Mesa for all my RV service needs.
2.5,5,"Bought a Winnebago back in September. Pleasant experience and a good price. Sales process very pleasant.
One suggestion: try to identify problems before you take possession. I think it's fairly common to have to schedule maintenance visits and then, of course, they want keep your RV for a while to fix it. We had a couple of minor problems which we fixed our selves in order to avoid the repair process."
2.5,1,"Bought a used Tiffin in Mesa,Az. Had numerous things to be fixed. 
They sold me a unit with a broken odometer, I think that is against the law?
Took 3 months to get microwave, satellite and entry steps replaced.
Like every other post  the service writers lie,lie, lie and don't return phone calls.
Trying to get electric mirrors replaced in Davis,Ca. It has been 1 month and still no response.
When can you tell if a RV service person is lying, there lips are moving.
Read post where people went to Robert Crist, they are worthless idiots along with LaMesa.
If you want good service in N. Ca. go to Affordable RV in Newcastle
If you don't give a s-t about the work you do them get a job at one of these placed."
2.5,1,"Attempted to get service on our 2007 Allegro Bus (in excellent shape)... the service desk did not ask what the problem was she simply stated ""we do not work on RVs that are 10 years old"". All that I wanted was a simple oil and lube job. I will never go to LA Mesa for any thing including when we upgrade (their adds are bate and switch). On our to Yuma we noticed a closed Le Mesa RV lot - with this kind of service it's no wonder. The girl behind the service switched board should be fired....The majority of the people in our RV Resort do not like La Mesa either."
2.5,5,"Five months ago I purchased an RV from CAMPING WORLD. I have never had such a bad experience in my LIFE, from sales, to finance ""YES finance"", then to service. So I gave up. I wanted to go camping this year ""the one thing I love doing in life"", so I wanted to leave all the bad behind, and move forward. 

On to the good review: LaMesa RV. ""Mesa location""
I called LaMesa RV in Mesa, and I talked to Karl Gwinn ""sales"" I told him the RV I was looking at. He said it was there, and he would hold it till I could come in the following day. So I went there the following day. Karl greeted me at the door, showed me the RV with NO pressure. I told him I wanted to think about it. He said I would have to leave a $500.00 deposit so I did ""100% refundable"". I came back today 9-1-18, and I asked him if I could view it alone. Karl said sure, so I did. It was the best experience EVER! I have never felt so relaxed in a purchase. I walked back in to the showroom, Karl was busy. So Ian the store manager took over. I never had to wait! Ian answered all my questions, and gave me assurance that my experience would not be like my last one at Camping world. Then they sent me to the finance office, and I met Lori. She also was not pushy, nor tried to sell me anything I did not want. With in moments she shook my hand, and said I was an owner of a new RV. If I would not have asked questions, and viewed the RV I bet I could have walked in, and walked out with an RV in thirty minutes. Unlike Camping World, and the BS they put you through with all there gimmicks. Five hours at Camping world.

I will be picking up my RV next week, or the following. I hope the experience keeps going like this. I will update this review after I receive the RV.

Thank you, Karl, Ian, and Lori. Seriously this purchase was the most amazing experience I ever had."
2.5,1,"Our experience started at rv show in Glendale 2-21-2014, when we found the (motorhome) mh we liked. Took it for a drive, my husband heard a noise, they said they would look into it, signed paperwork, there was a problem they fixed it. FINALLY picked up mh 4-2-2014, 4-14-2014, found more problems, 5-2-2014 took in for repairs, 6-19-2014 finally got it back, on way home had blow out (tires were over 7 1/2 yrs old) did over $9,000. damage which we had insurance but, still had to pay deductable (although not our fault) all because old tires! Contacted LaMesa finally got call back 7-14-2014 saying they wouldn't do anything, we took some action  and took to a different place for repairs, 9-22-2014 picked up mh drove it to LaMesa by the time we got there from west side of town another tire was low almost flat, left the mh there as we didn't trust it (we live over 50 miles away) and they wouldn't put new tires on it! Picked out another mh (which ended up of course to be in their favor, cost more and lower class) as that was all they would do, got it 10-6-2014, they fixed almost all of the problems (3-2015 we are still waiting for one item) tires were old on it too so they replaced them but we still had problems with them! After several attempts to correct tire problem on second mh they did find a bad tire and replaced it! Tires still don't perform like we think they should but?!! We finally (11-2014) have a decent mh but at higher payment than we wanted and lower class mh after almost a year of aggravation! We also referred them to some friends but, they said they won't go back either! Wish we would have checked this page out before. We too would give a lower star if possible. So buyer BEWARE!"
2.5,3,Well I went into the other LA MESA RV dealer across town and found the experience much better. I young man was very helpful and not pushy at all. He actually showed us some new things that were nicer for our needs. Thank you
2.5,1,"They had a large selection that I wanted to take my time and look through because I'm selling everything in May to RV full time. However the salesman took one look at my 20 year old suburban, asked my credit score, and told me that unless I have a 850 credit score that there is no way I'll get an RV.

I did get a lot of brochures though."
2.5,2,"Being interested in a motorhome and this being close to home. We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. We were greeted and shown around by a very aggressive sales guy that left a lot to be desired. On the 2nd coach he showed us, the high pressure pitch started. ""What is it going to take to get you in this coach today?"" When I told him to back off considering that we had only been there 15 minutes, he was no longer interested in helping us. I will use this place to look at floorplans, but I would never buy from them after my experience and then reading what previous customers have had to say here on yelp. It really is too bad considering their inventory."
2.5,1,"This review is for the service dept only.  I have not purchased from the sales department.  My husband and I dropped our RV off for a routine oil change, generator maintenance and an AC check (it was cycling on and off every few minutes).  After the RV being there for TWO WEEKS we finally called them.  For the first day we got no return calls from the two calls we placed to them.  The following day we were given the run around and finally spoke to a manager.  He told us it would be ready the next day. He also informed us that they couldn't fix the AC because they didn't know what was wrong!   Initially, we asked if they could also wash it while it was there.  The manager assured us it would be ready and washed the next day.  We actually waited two days, due to scheduling conflicts, to go pick it up.  When we called we were told they could not wash it because their machine was broken.  We arrived at 10:30 to pick it up only to see that 3 other RV's were being washed.  We will NEVER return to this dealership."
2.5,1,"The radiator on our motorhome leaked and had to be replaced.  Went to La Mesa RV to get a quote on the repair.  They knew we had no choices, we had to have it repaired.  The salesman called the manufacturer of our coach and quoted us $6400 just for the part plus shipping.  Yikes.  I thought I'd better do some homework and called the manufacturer myself and was quoted $4000.  Hello, are you serious? They were going to make $2400 on the part alone plus rake us over the coals on labor.  Sorry, no deal.  Went to Robert Crist RV and they got us a more reasonable price on the part.  We have been looking for someplace to take our rv for service while we are here in the winter.  It definitely wont be La Mesa RV."
2.5,1,Do not call this location and ask to speak to a salesman because all you're going to get is a VERY rude receptionist who THINKS she's knows all the answers.  I asked about a specific model and if the manufacturer was making a 2018 model.  Take your business elsewhere.
2.5,1,We were approached the second we got out of the car which I don't mind so much. Told him my budget was around 30k. I know it's not a big budget but that's all I cared to spend right now. I was laughed at by salesman and then he proceeded to ask me what I do for a living and did not show me a single unit. I'll take my 30k cash elsewhere
2.5,5,"I helped my parents, assisting them in the search for an RV.  We would search and search for RV's, and finally found the one mom wanted at La Mesa RV.  I believe that Frank was the one who helped us over the phone.    Very nice fellow.  He did the things we asked of him.  We are states away, so we needed to be sure that this motorhome was going to be what we wanted.  We worked with him via e-mail, text, conversation on the phone and photo's, as well as scanning.  He was super-good.  I recommend him.    So, because we would be flying down and picking this motorhome up, if it indeed met mom's expectations, we wanted an independent inspection.  So now I have to tell you about who we hired, he was great.   We used this company:  RV Guy Mobile RV Service, 1-877-784-8988, rvguy.net, he was wonderful.  He made the time to squeeze us into his schedule, he did a great job of checking out the vehicle on our behalf.  Note:  We asked him to do a pre-purchase inspection.  He even drove it for us.  What was also nice, is the guys at La Mesa RV know who he is, so they are familiar with him coming on site to do these inspections.  It was such peace of mind, knowing someone was there on our behalf, checking things out for us.  So, after hearing from him, mom decided to purchase.  Now La Mesa RV had already told us that they were going to pick us up from the airport!  So, we made our plans/reservations, and Frank picked us up in a beautiful, huge van.

While we were at La Mesa RV, they were super nice, super helpful and accommodating.  When it was time to meet together to finish up the sale with the finance guy, he was also great.  I wish I could remember his name, but he had black hair, I think.  He was so patient, so nice, so friendly.  He was on the ball.  He had the papers for whatever was necessary to transfer the title,   We were required to have ""proof of insurance"" before we could even take the vehicle off of the lot, otherwise they would have had to assign it to us.  The process that day, all included, was timely; however, this should be expected on such a purchase.

Also, just an fyi; people buying motorhomes need to be aware that the ""lemon law"" does not apply to motorhomes.  It is up to you, the purchaser, to be aware of the potential problems of a motorhome you are going to purchase.  The folks are the middle men; in-between buyers, sellers, companies who wholesale; it' up to you folks to get these things checked out independently, even though they will inspect them for you.  If something goes wrong with a motorhome, you should understand that it's up to you to have an independent inspection.  It's not La Mesa RV's fault if something goes wrong.

Also, after reading a review below, folks need to know - there are multiple finance people.  Before you go to the purchase of an RV meeting with the finance person, read through reviews and have your questions in hand.  You should ask things like, is there a document fee?  A PDI (pre delivery inspection) fee?  What other fees might there be?  What happens if my credit is bad?  What if I pay cash?  When will I get a title?  What if the motorhome was consigned?  (And so on and so forth.)  

So finally, I have to say...  Pretty much, an excellent experience.  The four of us flew down from states away to Phoenix, AZ, where Frank picked us up.  It was a very good, very professional and very pleasant overall experience.  ((On that note...  WAAAAAAAAAaaaaaay better and THOUSANDS of dollars less expensive than what it cost with the local dealers in my state who tried to charge my mom $2500 PDI (bogus $$) when we were going to take a motorhome in for private pre-purchase inspection... Watch out for those kinds of dealers -- ask questions before you go.  LA MESA RV in MESA, AZ WAS GREAT!!!

Then, we got in mom's new motorhome and I drove the motorhome ALL THE WAY HOME!!!  We drove, probably about 1500 miles home.  Motorhome drove home through desert heat, cold temperatures, the tires were great, the engine was great, ALL WAS GREAT!!  Again, I highly recommend RV Guy Mobile RV Service, 1-877-784-8988 for independent pre-purchase inspection.  :)"
2.5,2,"This is a huge operation with plenty of new and used inventory. But watch out for the salesmen, they attack you before you can get out of your car! Worse, they're lacking in knowledge, and they won't leave you alone to walk the yard looking at different coaches. We went their twice last month to shop for a late model motorhome. That was enough; we bought elsewhere."
2.5,1,"Service took several weeks and, expensive motorcycle cushion was stolen. I recommend not leaving anything of value even if locked up as they have keys when you leave it.  In this day and age, you just can't trust any one when it comes to business.  And, unfortunately, you can't prove anything unless you have proof. They also post not responsible for items taken...how convenient for them. It is sad there is no more integrity with these kind of businesses. Hopefully, this post will prevent someone else having something stolen."
2.5,1,I had my Oman generator serviced by this company.  I left it up on my property in North eastern Arizona after I had it serviced. Rats got into the generator box after a month. I had to clean Out the box and checked to find the hole they chewed through to seal it.  La Mesa RV pulled off the three access holes and didn't replace them.  Now I have wires I need to replace and also replace the access holes.  Thanks a lot la mesa. You caused me a lot of trouble and more work than I had you fix.  Never going back to them again.  They will take every shortcut to do the work you ask for.  Make sure they did the work you asked for. You may have a bad surprise like I did.  Never go back.
2.5,2,"LaMesa in a nutshell.  1) Anything the Service Dept tells you is a lie.  2) Don't buy the overpriced seal coat because it won't be done properly.  3) If they steer you towards Bank of the West, run the other way unless you want an overpriced lawn ornament you can't legally take out on the road.  

The details:  If this were based on sales, it would be 4 stars.  If it were based on their service department, I'd have to figure out a way to give them minus stars.  We bought a brand new Vilano from LaMesa.  They had over a month to go through it and make sure everything was ok.  We had an 8:30 AM appointment for our walk through and to transfer stuff from our old RV into our new RV.  We arrived and were met with blank stares.  Our new rig wasn't ready.  We were told to drop the old one and go get some breakfast and they'd be ready for us in two hours.  They couldn't check everything out in 40+ days so why did they think they could do it in two hours?  We finally started the walk through at 1:00 PM.  It was a disaster.  He couldn't even show us how to use the oven because they hadn't filled the propane tanks.  Halfway through, he gave up.  We never did get our walk through so it was up to us to figure out how our new RV works.  From there it went completely downhill.  My husband and are are both two time cancer survivors and he's had a liver transplant plus open heart surgery.  Dealing with their service department was actually worse than breast cancer and liver cancer combined.  Hard to imagine but true.  I've NEVER seen such incompetence in my life.  Every single day was a new lesson in broken promises and ineptitude.  We thought it was because we 'only' bought a high end fifth-wheel and not a half million dollar motor home but after six days of talking to our fellow service department 'refugees' it didn't seem to matter.  They were just as dissatisfied and frustrated as we were.  

When signing your paperwork, DO NOT buy the high dollar special sealant coat.  They suckered us into that then sprayed it over a dirty unwashed rig.  They knew they did a crappy job and even offered to reimburse us but I'm afraid that we're going to end up with finish problems down the road so have to keep it.  They also did a horrible job detailing our rig.  It took us a while to figure out what the sticky stuff that was sprayed all over our TV screen, walls and cabinets.  I'm guessing one of their employees exploded a soda inside and didn't clean it up.  It's taken two months but I'm finally getting the last of it cleaned off.  

Fortunately Vanleigh (Tiffin) has been great to deal with and we LOVE our new fifth-wheel or this would be one of the worst experiences of our lives.

The other horrible experience?  We took possession on March 20.  It's now October and we still have an RV that is unregistered in our state because their recommended lender, Bank of the West, hasn't bothered to submit the title and registration papers to our state.  I've spent HOURS on the phone with them since we got home and each time I finally track someone down who even knows what I'm talking about I'm promised that it will be 'expedited'.  Apparently my idea of 'expedited' and theirs is vastly different.  We are now making payments faithfully every month on an RV that can't leave our driveway because it isn't licensed or registered.  


Reply to Rand at La Mesa - we heard a lot of that from your Mesa store too but frankly, I'm not buying it.  When we finally escaped your torture chamber and got back to the RV Resort we were staying in, we heard the exact same complaints from others who had dealt with LaMesa stores in other locations and in previous years.  Your money is in selling them - not getting them ready to go out the door.   Your people KNEW that they were applying an expensive seal coat over a dirty rig and didn't care.  Now I'm stuck with an expensive shoddy job that has zero chance of being effective in protecting our investment because it was applied over the top of that pernicious Arizona black dust layer.  Thanks so much for screwing  us out all that money.  We may as well have thrown it out the window for all the good it will do us.  And speaking of black dust, your detailers can't even wash the floors before the rigs go out the door.  Our socks were black and ruined because the floors weren't mopped.  I was told they were but 'they just can't get that dirt off'.  Your 'professional detailers' couldn't do the job but I could?  After we got back to the RV park, I was able to get the floors clean in one try.  No more black feet and socks.  Funny what a Swiffer and a couple of Huggies wipes will do.  You're counting on people just giving up and going back to their homes in the North after they've bought the RV.  Four months later, I stand by my review.  Your service department is a pathetic joke."
2.5,5,"We feel very fortunate that we found La Mesa RV in Mesa. After a bad experience with a repair shop in town we took our rv to La Mesa. What a difference!! Our service representative Lance and his team were very methodical in their inspection and were able to diagnose the issues. They informed us of the necessary repairs & replacement parts that were needed. Lance kept us updated during the whole process. They communicated with our maintenance insurance company & worked with them within our policy requirements. When repairs were done our rv was inspected and washed. Our only expense was our deductible & a minor repair not covered. When we arrived to pick it up our unit was ready to go. Lance reviewed the repairs & bill with us and thanked us for using their service. What a pleasure doing business with such a professional shop with such a high quality of service. We will definitely use them in the future & recommend them to everybody.
Charles & Vicki Brooks"
2.5,3,Good prices and initial service good. I rated low because of their lack of follow up to all the pr Moses about have exceptional service and being part of the family. Hats off to Lauren in the finance group and the gal over title and registration. They are awesome
2.5,1,"bought our RV two weeks ago.  La Mesa turned a fun adventure into a total nightmare.  Should have read the reviews before going there.  Our Salesman Rich was fine and has been ""trying"" to help us. (at least he says he is, but not seeing anything)  But the rest of that place is the worst.  Not unhappy that we purchased a Thor, just wish we bought it from another dealer.  We will never step foot in that place, unless they tie us up and drag us in by force.  Steer clear of the whole lot, unless you plan to use another company for your service.  But it really isn't worth the headache... just stay away."
2.5,1,"A $146k vehicle 


A/c unit with heater, heater does not work, well
Windshield does not defog, quickly
No navigation system
They broke my CB radio in the install-nothing last 19

It's time to put these known murdered into their graves."
2.5,1,"I can see how you are gonna get the money to expand your service department.  You held my RV till I paid you over $400 for a quote for the repairs, no work was performed .  Bill Kuck told me they always charge to give quotes and you can get it back if you use LeMesa RV to perform the highly inflated repair costs.
Parts were marked up over 300% from what I can purchase them!
Labor hours were insanely high!"
2.5,1,"Over promise, under deliver.  Like the car industry, Cash&Dash dealership.  Barring all the failed promises, they did install my CB radio, did not return the box w/instructions. Parking brake: impossible to release, have tendinitis. The sliding door, use caution. Sliding door window: RATTLES horrifically on rough paved roads. Electrical instruction: rushed, had an emergency, no one else had knowledge.  Winnebago Revel: made only for men.  Women & Retirees want these vehicles, also:  Missed opportunity. Really like this vehicle; however...NO THOUGHT IN THE DESIGN.  And that's just the drive to the hotel, not had it camping.  Now on to my review of Larry H Miller Jeep:  disrespect women.  RIPPED OFF. Idiots LIED and made me fill out purchase papers a second tiime. While inside for 2 more hours,  Someone tampered with the heating/cooking unit that dies not work. DO NOT do biz with these people"
2.5,1,"STAY AWAY from La Mesa!!!!!!!  Do not buy from them and do not purchase Heartland products.  Started with a bait and switch pricing problem at time of sale.  I should've run away but I didn't.  I've owned it for 6 months, it's been in the shop for half of that time, including a trip to the factory in Idaho for repairs that could not get done here. Even with all that it's still not done.  The list grows every time I've used it.  They continue to ask me to bring it in so they can do the repairs that range from loose hinges to delamination.  This is a BRAND NEW unit. I shutter to think of the problems in on for after a couple years of service.  We have not used it one time with it problem free.  Listen to my warning.  Stay away from this dealer and the Heartland brand they sell.  Buyer beware if you do not believe me or the hundreds of other negative reviews out there.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!"
2.5,3,"We are going there on Monday the 27th to possibly finalize the purchase of a new Motorhome. I must say, some of these comments have me very concerned. 
I am hoping that they hold up to the agreements we made over the phone. I will repost and update when I return from Phoenix. Tyler R. Has been very attentive to our question so far."
2.5,4,"I lastosted that we were purchasing a RV from La Mesa, providing we were happy that our phone agreements would be met.
I am very pleased to report that we did get out new RV on the day it was promised. Tyler R. Who was our online salesman,was wonderful to work with. La Mesa delivered everything they promised and the headboard replacement arrived earlier than expected and was installed. We had anticipated having to return.
There was a delay due to the generator not starting. It was taken care of while we waited. The only reason, I am not giving La Mesa a 5 is that the waiting room is not all at comfortable or suitable for a delay of over a few hours. There was not a magazine to read. A wrinkled up newspaper was all that was available. There is a cooler wit bottled water . There is a popcorn machine.  There should be a TV available to help pass the time. We had to leave to get something to eat, as we were beginning to feel wore out and hungry.
It is a long day when purchasing an RV and I think La Mesa could improve the waiting room.
We are very happy with our Purchase and the service we received from everyone involved.the price was the best I could find and I was willing to travel to any state to get what I wanted. 
I am happy we went to LaMesa RV."
2.5,5,"We recently decided to purchase a new motorhome, and spent a lot of time in both Tucson and Phoenix looking around for the perfect vehicle.  When we originally visited La Mesa RV in Mesa, Arizona, we were put in touch with their ""web"" man, Karl Gwinn.  I had been corresponding by email and phone with Karl, and I have to say that he was very prompt and helpful in all of my questions and concerns.  We set up the initial appointment, and ultimately visited him on the lot in Mesa at least three times.  At that point, we were still deciding which kind of vehicle we would purchase, so we began looking more broadly.  Karl never bothered us, but when we came back a few months later, we picked up right where we'd left off.  There were times when Karl was on vacation, and his partner, Paul Bunswick, was equally helpful.  Ultimately, we ordered a new Roadtrek (factory built) and both Karl and Paul helped with the order itself, changes we made to the order a few times, and even informed us about available rebates.

A few months later, we went to Mesa to pick up the Roadtrek.  We needed to come on a Sunday, but La Mesa RV arranged that for us.  We got a very thorough walk-through from Eric Duperron in service, and actually identified one small problem that had not been noticed before.  La Mesa kept the vehicle, had it repaired at the local Mercedes dealership for us, and then even delivered it to us in Tucson at the day and time that we specified!

Since deliver, we have sense spoken with both Eric and Karl to clarify some of the features, and found them both exceedingly helpful.  

I would not hesitate to recommend La Mesa RV in Mesa as the FIRST place you should go when you're shopping for an RV.  They are extremely knowledgeable, patient with questions, and definitely not ""pushy"" to make the sale.  Kudos to La Mesa RV!!"
2.5,1,"We are first-time RV buyers... we opted to go with a big-name dealer because they had a big selection, and this was a huge purchase for us-- basically this was the first ""home"" my husband and I bought together.

We'd been to several shows to browse, and at each one we were accosted by sales people who were far too pushy. Like a slimy used car lot, but worse. We got lucky the day we decided to buy: ""Ryan the Canadian"" is a great sales person, not pushy, answered questions honestly, and left us alone to talk it over. When we decided we wanted to try for financing, another salesperson eavesdropped and offered to get us the finance guy. We didn't realize that this was basically handing the commission to someone who didn't do any work for us. The finance person was just another sales person who filled out the application for us, and after we got a little pushy about where Ryan was in all this, it was decided the form-filler-outer and Ryan would split the commission. Ryan was extremely gracious and just wanted us to have a positive experience. I know it wasn't his fault that his coworkers are sketchy.

The form-filler-outer recognized us from our first visit to La Mesa some time ago, so he needed to stop mid-form to show us pictures of his new baby. And congrats to the guy, but there's a million reasons why a young married couple like us don't have kids, and he has no idea what kind of hurt he could be causing by making us look at pics of his new baby and telling us stories. We're already about to buy-- no need to try to tug at heartstrings, pal.

When we asked them to make sure the closing took place in Phoenix, because we're in the West Valley, they ""forgot"" and we had to drive out to Mesa. They gave us $100 in store credit for the inconvenience, but the store is really over priced with a limited selection-- and wasn't open on the day we closed on our purchase (Saturday), so we had to drive BACK to Mesa (another inconvenience) to use the credit.

We bought a trailer without owning a truck, and they sure were happy to sell us anything we wanted without the truck... they offered to deliver it, but when it was delivered on one of the hottest days of the summer, and the leveling jacks didn't work properly, the delivery people just shrugged and said they couldn't help us, and to call the dealer on Monday. The pile of owners manuals didn't include the leveling jack system, and it took some frantic calls to Ryan over the weekend (he emailed us the manuals personally) to get any information, and he had the service department call us on Monday. The service person was nice enough to come to us the next day to walk us through resetting/recalibrating the system, but it sure was a long weekend of buyer's regret wondering what kind of ripoff we'd signed up for, before then.

Almost immediately after the sale, we received a manufacturer recall notice (in July)... I spent many phone and email conversations with a service manager who continually dropped the ball. It's now October and we still haven't had this issue addressed-- conveniently, that service manager is no longer with the company, so I get to start over fresh with his replacement.

One of our concerns is that it shouldn't take days or weeks to get around to something that's 3 hours of work (according to the service bulletin), because we don't want to leave the RV there while they sit on it and don't do the work until it's convenient for them. This is not a safety-related recall, and we should not have to be without our RV for weeks or months (while our warranty ticks away) over a 3-hour job.

The sexism among the staff is a bit much: I'm really tired of the ""happy wife, happy life"" jokes, and I don't know how many times I have had to tell them that my last name is different than my husband's, when they keep calling me Mrs. His-Last-Name. My husband also works nights, so we asked over and over again (at every phone call) that they need to call MY cell number because not only do they wake him up when they call, but he doesn't consciously comprehend the message/missed call until after the close of business, so it delays our communication by a day (or a weekend). When I call them and leave only MY number, they still call HIS number. I finally called their main customer service line last week and asked them what we can do about this issue. They promised that if they physically deleted his number from our file, this was a master record and only my number would exist to La Mesa. And yet today, I finally get a callback regarding the aforementioned recall, but they called my husband's number-- who has been unwell and having trouble sleeping during the day, making his night shift job that much more miserable. Also the caller had no idea about the previous conversations I'd had with the service manager(s).

This isn't our last RV purchase, but this was definitely our last La Mesa purchase."
4,1,"You know what happens when a woman walks into a shop?  True to this, Rainbow Muffler gave me a run around with the warranty repairs of the catalytic converter.  Aside from the fact that this part bears 5 years warranty and the shop is silent about this, instead of replacing the faulty part still on warranty, they simply erased the code.  Of course, it popped up again a bit later on, I am once again bringing the car back, and sure enough, they do the old trick by erasing the code.  Back then, I didn't realize what they were doing as I was clueless about the diagnostic codes.  Well, I know now, and I am not setting my foot in this shop.  You pay a little less but in this shop, you get what you pay for.  NEVER AGAIN, and highly NOT recommended!!"
4,5,"A friend recommended Rainbow Muffler and I was desperate to get my loud muffler fixed. I was expecting the worst, based on my prior experiences with auto repair shops, but was pleasantly surprised when the bill was way less then I expected. Brandon was very professional. He took the time to explain everything that was done to the vehicle, and did the job in like, twenty minutes. When he said he repaired a piece on the Catalytic, I was very impressed.  Any other place would have just told me it needed replacing, for another $250! I now need to have my heating system looked at and will be calling him next week to do the job. Even though I live a ways away, the honesty and piece of mind is worth the drive for me. Thank's Brandon, you've made a lifetime customer!"
4,3,"I lost my entire muffler/exhaust this morning. I called Firestone and they wanted over $600! I called Rainbow Mufflers and was told a much lower price (under $150) so that is where I stopped by this afternoon to have my car repaired. So to keep things simple, the guy who actually worked on my car was fantastic! He explained things to me, was very friendly, and even worked with me on the price which turned out to be $286. 

Now the guy I spoke to on the phone this morning was friendly on the phone but apparently not very knowledgeable of the field he is in. He told me he knew exactly what part I was talking about and to throw away the parts of my car that fell off and reassured me of this and the $150 price even after I discussed and questioned this multiple times. But I don't know much about cars so I trusted him. When I got there the guy seemed rude and short with other customers and other staff. One worker forgot to put a ladies oil change sticker in her window and the counter guy loudly complained in front of all the customers how if he wants something done right he has to do it himself. This guy was just unprofessional all around. My ending price was higher than expected, but that was because I could have salvaged my old parts (that I was told to throw away) instead of having to get completely new and custom fitted pipes."
4,5,"I tried out rainbow muffler because it's nearby.  Honestly, I wouldn't go anywhere else now that they've earned my trust.  Great service, honest mechanics, and they won't fix the wrong problem.  They made it possible for me to travel home to see my family over thanksgiving and I couldn't be more happy!"
4,5,I got a quote on installing new parts that I purchased on my own. The price to install my parts was very affordable. The service was great. The job ended up taking longer then expected do to the difficulty of the job. My original quote was by the hour pricing. They honored the original price quoted and did a quality job. I would recommend rainbow to anyone in need of exhust repairs.
1,1,"RENTERS BEWARE!  We are pretty easy-going people.  We are not shocked or troubled by minor issues that pop up when camping.  This is not a review on the RV - this is a review on the character (or lack thereof) of this company.  First, the ladies in the office are fantastic!  Nicole is very responsive and attentive.  The RV we originally booked (Leprachaun) was broken down so they did put us in another RV. (Forester) When we arrived, the RV did not have working heat.  Mike told us to give him 15 minutes and he would repair it.  OK, no big deal.  You will notice the contract requires you to refill the propane tanks when you return the unit.  Be sure to manually check them before you leave.  Mike asked that we call him with any problems before calling Roadside Service in case it was something he could walk us through.  (Roadside Service is expensive).  Fair enough.  A short time later, Mike had heat blowing so we were off!  Our first night was rough.  The heat did not work, the propane tank was only 1/4 full, the black tank was full, the stove did not work, the oven did not work, the DVD player did not work, the sofa had trash ankle deep behind it, the inside and outside refrigerator had sticky drippings and had to be cleaned, a remote was missing...... OK, these things happen.  We called Mike and his response was, ""I'm out getting parts, I will call you back"".  He did.  6 hours later.  Mike suggested we must have a propane leak which would explain the low propane and the heating/stove issue.  Great! Now we can worry about blowing up the campground and our family.  This made us double check the fire extinguisher.......it expired years ago.   Mike gave us the clear to call roadside service.  We did.  Roadside Service hadn't called back several hours later so we headed to Walmart to buy an electric space heater and called Mike back.  Mike's response was ""What do you want me to do about it, I'm in Concord"".  Nice.  This must be the ""customer service"" they so proudly boast.  Roadside service finally came 24 hours later.  The technician was appalled at the condition of the unit and said no repair had ever been made to the heat.  Thankfully, there was no propane leak which confirmed the unit was not inspected or prepared before our departure.  We had a few incidents when we were almost rear ended.  We commented on these ""aggressive mountain drivers"" only to find out we were driving around with no tail light on one side.  Nice.  The final insult came when it was time to dump the tanks.  Yes, the hoses had several holes in them so as you would guess - the black tank was spewing everywhere.  So gross.  We emailed RV Rentals of the Carolina when we returned regarding the language in the contract clearly states you are entitled to your daily rate plus taxes in such situations.  We never received a response.  We called multiple times.  No returned calls.   So...after paying $250 per night we spent our entire trip unable to use our RV for much outside of sleeping with no heat, we missed a entire day waiting for a repair service and the company won't even respond.  Our experience with RV Share was seamless and top notch experience.  We highly recommend sticking to RV Share.  Rv Rentals of the Carolinals will try to tell you the owners may not be properly insured for renters but RV Share requires rental insurance be in place.  Deal directly with an owner."
1,2,If you rent an RV from this location do a through check out.  I rented one and had several small issues while I was driving to and from my destination.  I sent them feedback but never received a reply nor the final bill as requested.
1,1,"After filing a complaint with our credit card company for resolution in no receiving our $1000.00 deposit, I just received official notice that RV Rentals of the Carolinas has filed for bankruptcy.

We were able to speak with the owner twice; both times she gave excuses for the deposit refund delay.  They ignored subsequent phone calls after that. We are out our deposit as ""they have no assets""."
1,1,I was not happy with their service on how they smoke and other people have said the same about renting from them
1,1,Closed and filed for bankruptcy shortly after taking our deposit. Talked badly about another local company doing the same thing.
3.5,5,"Great service and friendly staff. They always deliver as promised and there has never been an unexpected charge. They have been servicing my vehicles for 10 years and I won't go anywhere else. Thank you Brian, Josh, Charlie and staff."
3.5,1,"How long does it take for u to pay and get one of these 

I paid half up front  and later nothing they don't even respondTo emails or calls if you give them money"
3.5,5,"Great service for our Spartan chassis in our Entegra motor home.

Josh was great to work with. Replaced a defective fuel sending unit. Changed oil in generator, Cummins 450 engine and the Allison transmission. 

Charles was our tech. A real pro. We stayed in our coach while they did the work. 

They are on a vey quiet cul de sac in Henderson just outside of Las Vegas. 

This is the place to go for Spartan service."
5,5,"I ordered a utility trailer from this company. It is awesome and exactly what I ordered/wanted. Straight forward approach to sales. (I hate being ""sold"" stuff, and I never felt pushed or coerced.) excellent quality with excellent professionalism.  I would recommend Jackson's Trailers for anyone in the market for a utility trailer or work trailer."
5,5,Ranted a trailer for camping. Good people to deal with and the rental was in great shape and works well. They even put a new spare tire on before the trip which was comforting and thoughtful.  I can tell these people are interested in doing things well and that means the world. I will rent here and if I can buy a trailer I will buy here.
5,3,"Not The Greatest Prices

Jackson's trailers has a decent location in Mesa AZ if that's near where you are located. The unfortunate problem is I have bought one trailer here that I got a decent deal on about five years ago. I've tried three separate times to buy another trailer there and they're always too much higher-priced than other places to make it impossible to be able to actually buy it there.

Today when I talked to them on the phone and tried to buy a trailer they only offered to take $50 off the asking price saying it's a great deal but all over the Internet people have them listed for cheaper, so I guess I won't try to do any more business there again.

It's frustrating when you want to buy a trailer and you experience the same round and round routine that you would at a used car sales lot. Everyone telling you that they don't make any money selling trailers just like the used car salesman everybody has the best products, everybody has an answer to every question, but the answers are all made up.

Once I would like to find a place to buy things like this that just has a good price you go to pick it up by it and move out with it and it's all done.

Otherwise PJ is my favorite brand of trailer the quality level is great, and really you can't go wrong with this brand of trailer that they sell there."
5,5,I was very pleased  in doing business with Jacks Sons Trailers. I traded in a trailer And purchase a new trailer and I felt I was treated more than fair. They are very helpful and I'm more than willing to take the time to help you and discuss options to make your trailering experience a good one. Had to bring the trailer back a couple of times for warranty work and they were more than accommodating. I find that they are fair with pricing on their service and accessories as well. They don't try to nickel and dime you. I would be more than happy to Give them my future business as well. And also note that I purchased a trailer from them about nine years ago and was very happy with them at that time as well. I would recommend JacksSons!
5,5,"These guys are TOP NOTCH, I've purchased 4 trailer from them and every transaction has been great. They're trailer are the best quality in the business, prices are great, and the staff makes it happen! 


Before going somewhere else because ""those guys"" have a cheaper trailer, see why. In the construction field, overbuilt is better. PJ trailers are over built and are of high quality. The difference in quality vs big Tex or any other trailer manufacturing doesn't even compare!"
5,5,"My husband and I went to Jackssons Trailers and had Kyle help us. Went in there with a damaged trailer and he took the time to go through the trailer and explain process of repairing it to realize it was not worth the repair. Kyle explained benefits of a new trailer and helped us pick another one out. He was not rushed, he was very polite, and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend Jackssons Trailers to anyone looking for a trailer! I will refer my friends to him."
5,5,This place has the right trailers for nearly any job. I came here because I know they are a dealer for PJ trailers.  Their trailers are especially heavy duty compared to their competitors. If you want to get something that will last for years and years come here and get a PJ trailer. If they don't have what you want in stock just custom order / build one through these guys and they can walk you through different options available for your needs.
5,5,This place is great!  Fair prices and great selection.  I moved my whole house with their trailers.  Way cheaper than U-Haul.
5,5,"Drove all the way from Orange County CA and purchased a 20 foot trailer and accessories, excellent customer service!"
4,4,"I stayed here once, and it was a pretty nice place!  There was a pool and mini golf.  I remember thinking I got swimmers itch from the pool.  Or probably it was that there was a lot of chlorine in the water and it was irritating my skin.  There was a large changing room/shower/bathroom area by the pool which was nice.

There was a big pavilion, so if you had a group event it would be a perfect site.

What I didn't like was that you didn't feel very secluded or that you had your tent pitched in the woods at all.   From the tent area, you could look over the lawn and see the county road and all the cars driving by.

Also, it was a little on the more expensive side.  I'm not sure if you can get a deal by calling ahead or what.  It might be worth a try!"
4,3,"We went to this campground with a larger group of 5 campers, we have been here before and enjoyed so we went back. We didn't receive any papers with any sort of rules at all. Owner didn't seem friendly at all or flexible with any rules what so ever. She was frankly rude to us when she could have just said what she needed to say. Otherwise the place is decent and there is a lot of room to run dogs!"
4,5,"First time visit. Accommodations are great. Nice shade and great folks running the place. 

Shower houses and the grounds are impeccable. 

Little noisy from the road but we still say! Its a great place."
4,4,"My family and i recently stayed at viking campground. We found the campground immaculate . 
 The staff  helped us to settle in and even provided some of the items that we forgot. This was our very first time out w our new  coach and we couldnt have picked a better place. Will go back."
3.5,1,My wife and I but a 2005 Keystone sprinter service department at Cooper rv is the worst we had nothing but problems with our sprinter cost us a few thousand dollars to fix our rv  would never buy it again off Cooper RV. stay far away if you can thank you
3.5,5,"I bought my current RV, a 2008 Springdale Summerland, new from Cooper's. They were absolutely terrific throughout the entire process. When not in use, I stored it near there for a few years, and their service folks even went out of their way to come to my storage spot and help with rigging the sway bar system I had bought, as I had forgotten all the steps (new RV owner syndrome) (plus I'm dumb...lol). Over the years I have been back numerous times for parts, accessories, inspections...and they continue in being top notch for service and courtesy! Just today I was having my trailer inspected. My appointment was for 9:30; I got there an hour early, just as they were opening up. What'd they do? Inspected the trailer right away and I was out of there by 9.
This is how you take care of customers. This is how a business should operate. This is why I will go nowhere else, and when my current trailer is ready to be replaced, this is the only place I'll go! Cooper's is the BEST!"
3.5,4,"Very friendly helpful staff, even if you don't buy anything. They are patient and try to direct you to what will suite your needs."
4.5,5,I have always looked for a great mechanic who is fair and honest. THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING.  Give them a try and you'll see what I mean.
4.5,5,"Scott with Monaghan's auto repair, If you need anything in the future my store address is 2009 S. Decatur Blvd., Las Vegas, NV 89102. 

I want to give a big thanks to this guy Scott that works here at this location I was stranded at work and I called his store looking for a starting fuse to replace for my car because it would not start. Scott suggested that I should tap on my starter lightly with a hammer while somebody turn the key to the on position he said sometimes this will work to start the car. So me and my fiancé attempted this and by good luck my car started this guy Scott knows what he's talking about at this location. So it looks like I need a new starter. Thanks again Scott for saving me a tow fee to the auto garage."
4.5,5,Scott took great care of my classic Chevy truck we were driving back from California to Texas. Good man who cares about his work. Thanks
4.5,5,"Scott and his team AGAIN fixed one of my sons cars. Brought it in and within minutes and a test drive Scott knew what was wrong. Within a day it was fixed and running like a new car. I use to go to another mechanic and was introduced to Scott and now he is my families go to guy! I feel very confident on any thing that Scott tells me and really makes me understand what is going on. He is very polite, knowledgeable and fair and I know the work is done right! Monaghan's is my whole families mechanic you can't go wrong!"
4.5,5,"We cannot say enough about Scott and his crew. On our way home to Canada, our trailer broke down at the side of the freeway, AAA left us stranded for 9 hours, but that is another story. We were desperate to find someone to replace the wheel bearings and after contacting what seemed like every RV dealer and car repair shop in Las Vegas, we were finally referred to Monaghan's. Scott reassured us that he would wait until we got to the shop no matter what time it was and that he would get us on the road ASAP. Scott kept us posted during every step of the process and less than 24 hours later he had us headed back to Canada. Not only did he repair the damage, he checked the rest of the wheels and gave us assurance that we would make it home. We should add we would have paid anything without question, but Scott never took advantage of our misfortune, the price was beyond fair.  We would not hesitate to recommend Monaghan's!    Mike and Cindy"
4.5,5,Amazing service. I needed a new water pump. The job was completed on time at a fair price. I would recommend this shop for all of your auto repair needs.
4.5,5,"Monaghans Auto Repair is the best mechanic shop in town. With trustworthy mechanics, along with great customer service, I leave his shop happy every time."
4.5,5,Best of the best mechanics! Always courteous & Fair. Ask for Scott. Keep my 2005 Chrysler running like a charm. Cause I'm just nurse this baby another year. Even when I get another automobile Monaghan's always my first choice for total auto care!!
4.5,5,Great service and honest people. Always a pleasure doing business here and we would never take our Ford Edge anywhere else. After multiple visits for different reasons we know we can trust Scott and his team.
4.5,5,.
4.5,5,Great customer care. Had my vehicle down and Scott sent his tow truck guy to pick it up. Scott was straight forward and honest with what I needed. For sure made a costumer for life and would recommend to my friends and family. Give him a shot you won't be disappointed.
4.5,5,Monaghans is absolutely the best mechanic shop in town.  I will not take any of my trucks (personal and work) anywhere else.  Scott is amazing!  He explains everything in detail and his prices are extremely reasonable.
4.5,5,"Best auto body repair in town! Our RV was having generator problems and all the guys at the shop have been very helpful. They took us on an emergency bases when over a dozen other auto body shops were booked a week out. They were not looking to scam us, completely straight forward. We needed to be able to leave town and Scott helped us temporarily fix the problem and not try and rip us off. We will be returning for all our auto body needs! Nice to find people that know what their talking about in this town!"
4.5,5,Scott took great care of me and my car. I went in thinking I had a bad alternator as another mechanic shop told me and it turned out to be a cheap valve sensor. Great work and fair prices! Will definitely recommend and return
4.5,5,Haven't had AC all summer so I decided to do something about it. Called Monaghan's and had me up and running cool within 2 hours of my call. Scott was very helpful and had me taken care of quickly and efficiently.
4.5,5,"Monaghan's Auto has been fixing my vehicles for years. Scott comes from an extensive automotive background, and can diagnose a problem within minutes. His prices are fair and competitive, and he always guarantees his work. His shop is clean and comfortable and regardless of how busy he gets, he finishes when he says he will. He's also a longtime Vegas local, and has a large network of professionals to recommend around the Valley. I won't take my vehicles anywhere else for repair."
4.5,5,I was 40miles South of Vegas on way To SoCal and my car breaks down - an ANGEL named Travis helped me with his general knowledge that it was going to be ok - I got to his friend a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED shop - honestly and true!! And they had it repaired in just a few short hours - tensioner pulley was gone and serpentine belt was hanging loose- awsome service and - friendly professional mechanics- so glad to be fast back on the road -
4.5,5,"Scott is a great Mechanic and honest.  He has repaired my vehicles for years.  If you are looking for an experienced mechanic you can trust, contact Scott at Monaghan's Auto Repair."
4.5,5,"Scott and the business he runs is incredible. I was visiting and had a check engine light come on. After another shop basically charged me $200 to brake my truck, Scott went above and beyond to help me out. He did a quality job at an extremely reasonable price. If you have any needs for your vehicle, especially diesel, bring it here. Thank you Scott and crew."
4.5,5,Was referred to Monaghan's by another repair facility in town. When I called he was more than happy to slide me in to get my vehicle looked at. He was quickly able to diagnose the issue and was able to get parts there to repair it very promptly. It was a nice experience to deal with a professional and be treated as well as I was. Thank you for getting me back out on the road!
4.5,5,"I called Scott early in the morning, my SUV was dead in my garage, a very short time later one of his awesome technicians came and replaced my battery faster than it takes to jump a car. Loving the service, I went right in for an Oil change. Super guys, great shop, great work and great prices. You have a forever customer with me for all future work, thank you guys again. I recommend this shop!"
4.5,5,After my GEICO roadside assistance couldn't help me with a dead battery... other than a jump or tow. I called Scott and within a short time he arrived at my office and installed my new battery. Very professional and I would highly recommend.
4.5,5,"Scott was great. He is the definition of a local mechanic, been going to him for years.  When you need a trusted mechanic Monaghan's is the place to go 100%. 

My check engine light was on and he was able to get me back on the road and passing smog within a couple hours.  He was able to diagnose the real issue sand the part wasn't that expensive. Thanks again Scott!"
4.5,5,"This 2nd generation family shop was a great find! My car was stuck in park and the shifter wouldn't budge. I rigged it with a screwdriver from a YouTube video. I first called the Dodge dealership who said they couldn't fit me in for over 3 weeks. Then I turned to Yelp and found Monaghan's. They answered right away, and from my description knew exactly what needed to be done. They called the dealership to get the part I needed and called me back in 5 minutes to let me know they could do the repair that same day!! They even let me know what the cost would be over the phone! Work was done in two hours and I was on my way. They were even nice enough to look at a nuisance problem I have had that Pep Boys and the dealership couldn't figure out, and you guessed it... they can fix that too! I have found the folks I will be taking my vehicles to from now on."
4.5,5,"I just can't say enough good things about Monaghans auto repair. I took my car to a dealership and they tried to tell me I needed $1800 worth of repairs. I thought that seemed odd so I took it to Scott, he looked it all over and gave me great confidence that it's in good shape and didn't need any of the repairs that the dealership said it needed.

Customer for life...Thank you!"
4.5,5,Scott was very helpful. He said to come in first thing in the morning. He test drove our Ford F-350 and found the problem. He ordered the parts and got us back on the road by 1:00.  Handled our overheating problem pulling a 35' trailer. Great service and peoplds. Me. Kodi has
4.5,5,Took my infiniti G35 in for overheating issues. He looked at it right away and had it fixed within 30 minutes. He also explained everything he was doing to the vehicle and walked me through the fix.  I also know more about my vehicles cooling system thanks to Scott. Will use him as my mechanic exclusively from here on out.
4.5,5,"Scott Monaghan is awesome! Our 1998 Plymouth (yes, a 20 year old vehicle) needed a rebuilt transmission a couple years ago and although working on our van was hell, he did it and did it right. Recently, our van had some main computer issues and Scott worked with us to get the problem fixed. His rates are more than reasonable, and we recommend him highly. Thankfully we have another vehicle that is much newer, and if it ever needs work we will take it to Scott. He is a master at what he does."
4.5,5,"Scott and his guys take great care of us every time I take my work frocks in, there done in a timely fashion and reasonable price. GREAT JOB!!!"
4.5,5,Scott is so nice and honest. He works quick to fix the problem and does it right! We will definitely be back for any car problems we have!
4.5,5,Monaghan's auto repair is the best auto shop in vegas hands down. My vehicle was making weird noises and Scott fixed my vehicle and now it drives like new. Go here for great service!!!!
4.5,5,These guys are top notch. They helped repair my stepfathers truck (he lives out of state) and even had the patience to call him and explain what was needed. Price was very reasonable and everyone I interacted with was professional and courteous.
4.5,5,"Friendly and Terrific service! Called from an hour away with a/c issues on a big road trip.  Devin stayed to see us, worked quickly, and fixed the problem right away."
4.5,5,"A damsel in distress as I was leaving work to drive home my battery was dead. I quickly searched for a mobile service and found Monoghan's. It was almost time for them to close and they sent Eric over, as he arrived, unexpected help also came so we decided just to jump the battery.  Eric was awesome even though we decided to go another route to fix the dilemma. I most definitely will be using your services in the future!"
4.5,5,"Great place. Took my car in on a Thursday, had an answer on Friday and it was fixed by Monday. Loved the service. Will come back! Ask for Scott or Mike"
4.5,5,Scott and his guys are great people to work with they will always find what is wrong with your vehicle and fix they problem Scott is also very reasonable on the repairs
4.5,5,"Scott is a hell of a guy. I got referred to him and will be doing business with him from now on. He has taken my calls and issues and got my truck back on the road same day. Worth every dollar. Go to Scott!
Adam"
4.5,5,Wow !! Scott and his team have revamped the way it feels to get your car serviced ! They are honest with direct timely service !! So happy to have found them. My van is specialty and not common and their knowledge has helped me time and time again ! Thanks Scott ! Best in the valley !
4.5,5,"Scott is a true professional.  He was able to diagnose my custom 2004 Duramax (LBZ) Suburban with a 2004 Silverado nose clip.  He replaced a leaking hydro boost, power steering hoses, and fixed the air conditioning.  Scott takes pride in his work and also takes the time and effort to explain what he is doing and more importantly the why.  I will be taking my vehicles here when I am in town.

Thanks again.
Taft"
4.5,5,Scott is the best! I trust no one else with the care of my vehicles. He is very knowledgeable and the prices are reasonable.
4.5,1,"It really and truly takes A LOT for me to write such a negative review, but I feel people have a right to know that you won't get the positive experience here you are expecting. First off, the owner/manager, Scott...I have to tell you that he is blunt and tells it like it is and I am not questioning whether or not his mechanics or intent top fix something is there, but his customer service is horrendous. So I bring my Corvette in for a few repairs because I was referred to him by a family member who had work done by him. All in all, my father and brother probably gave this guys at least $4,000 worth of business so I trusted him. (Shouldn't have because my brother had issues with this guy before I did). So I bring in the Corvette and ask this guy to repair two things: 1) Fix ALL leaks (whether it's oil, coolant, whatever is leaking, just repair it) and 2) A ""Low Washer Fluid"" light has appeared and I wanted that removed. I informed him that I already replaced the washer wiper fluid sensor myself so it's clearly something else causing the problem. After a week (yes, this guy holds your car in for long periods of time) in his shop, I get my car back trusting the issues are fixed and pay a sum of over $950 for both repairs (I have the receipt to prove both repairs were done). Now, I already didn't trust this guy due to him charging me $150 for a washer fluid sensor I already told him I replaced myself for $15. So I have no idea why he replaced the sensor again. (He claims I put on an aftermarket washer fluid sensor but I bought it straight from the Chevy dealership so that's not correct). And he was already rude in demeanor. (I called two days after he had my car for an ETA on when the car would be ready and got the rude reply, ""How the heck am I supposed to know? I haven't even looked at it yet!"") First of all, it's been over two days. Second, I wasn't nagging or pressuring you, I was asking for an ETA. Chill out on your customers for asking questions, dude! I don't hesitate to pay though, trusting it to be done. 
One week later, I notice, that not only is my car STILL leaking oil but the ""Low Washer Fluid"" sensor is still triggering. So essentially, I paid $950 dollars and NOTHING was fixed. 
So I return back to him with my vehicle to fix and address BOTH issues since they were both paid for with the assumption he would fix both issues without charging since this was what was promised. Well, I call him three days later and he hasn't looked at my car at all. So I let him know to please inform me ASAP.
3 days later, Scott calls me to tell me the oil leak is fixed but he tore a part my dash to figure out the issue with the ""Low Washer Fluid"" light coming on. Immediately I was upset that he tore a part my dash WITHOUT my consent because I had a feeling he was going to charge for this procedure. Now, any other repair shop or dealership I have been to gives you a flat rate diagnosis of $100-150 and they let you know based off of that what your next step should be BEFORE you have to go further and pay extra. Not Scott. 
He tears apart my dash and claims he has to call a guy in Cali for the part and the repair is more serious. I told him I am not that concerned with a faulty ""Low Washer Fluid"" light coming on as it does not affect driving. My main gripe was the oil leak. He says if he puts my car back together now, it's going to cost me $330.
First off, you go ahead and tear a part my car without asking me if it's ok to proceed with the repair and NOW you want to charge over $330 to diagnose a problem that I already paid $950 for? Yes, that's right $330 to diagnose it and NOT fix the problem! 
When I call him out on his lies, he says he ASSUMED I gave the go ahead when I brought the car back to him. I told him that I ONLY brought the car back to him to fix what I paid for originally. He says he has a family to feed and his new excuse is that I paid $950 for just the oil leak. I told him that my receipt clearly shows that I also paid him that amount to fix the Washer fluid light sensor as well. 
He says ""Well, I did fix it. It worked for two days, right?""
So a repair that works for two days is ok? But he's arguing and won't back down from the $330 diagnostic price. I told him with the thousands of dollars my family has brought him in good word of mouth business, he should admit his mistake and forego the diagnostic charge. He says he does ""QUALITY work"". QUALITY work is fixing it right the first time and not charging without permission for the second time, Scott! 
He then holds my car for 3 weeks and avoids my calls and now wants to charge $800 for part I found for $100 online in 5 minutes and he didn't back down from $330 of which he never fixed the issue. 
Almost called the cops (other reviewers on here called cops also)but I just wanted my car back! On top of all this, he uses pictures of my car (again without my permission. Surprise!) to promote his crappy services on here! 
Scam artist and rude all in one!"
4.5,1,"Don't go to this place, they are scams. I took the car for an estimate and after he gave me a high estimate I refused to fix it there so he didn't want to give my car back unless I pay $100. So i called cops and they came took the car. Be careful people from this shop."
4.5,5,"I was visiting Las Vegas and my Ford Fusion started having issues. I called all of the Ford places & got attitude and ""we can't help you till next week"" I found Monaghan's, called & got the nicest response. They figured it out and kept in contact with us!!! So happy to help a small business & work with awesome people! Scott was so nice and knew his stuff!! Thank you guys sooo much!!"
4.5,5,"Hands down THE BEST auto shop in Vegas. They're quick, honest, and they actually know what they're doing! For the first time in my life I didn't feel like I was being taken advantage of or over charged for car repairs, the auto shop literally right across the street quoted me double the price they did! 
They didn't have the part my car needed so they quickly called a bunch of places until they found it for me and had my car fixed in no time. Highly recommend."
4.5,1,"Whenever I go to an auto body shop I'm very skeptic and nervous about taking my car in and being over charged, so I felt a little safe thinking this place was alright due to its good reviews.

It turns out I was VERY wrong. My car had an issue with the cam rollers about a year ago and I took it to a person who was at the time partnering with the owners at Monaghan's. I paid almost $700 to have the issue ""fixed"" so flash forward now a year later. My car starts to idle and I have a feeling it's the cams again.
So I take it to Monaghan's thinking since they worked on my car and my fathers car in the past they could refix or repair the new issue my car is having.

The initial price quoted was $1700 to fix. A few days later they call and say that something broke, a cam has to be replaced and now the price is going to be $2400. That's about a third of what the car is worth, seriously? They said they wouldn't charge for the extra labor though.. upon looking at the receipt the total just for labor was $1200, which would amount to over 11 hours of labor, and they said they aren't charging me extra??

Worse though is what they did to my family. My brother also took his vehicle in for a low washer fluid light sensor and fluid leak.

He asked to have all or any leaks fixed and informed that he changed the sensor himself but the low washer light is still going on.
A week later after as being told rudely: ""how the heck am I supposed to know how long your car will take to fix?""
He finally gets it back and after paying over $950, the light sensor comes on 2 days later.

What's Monaghan's response? ""Hey it worked for 2 days."" So if you come here, their ""quality"" work is only good for 2 days then your problems are back???

My brother goes back and tells him the issue he paid for wasn't fixed, and after another week (2 weeks now) my brother calls and the guy says he took his car apart (with out his permission) and is going to charge another $330 for it plus a part coming from California next week that is $800. 

So he's going to double charge now for something that was already paid for and written on his first bill? That's completely dishonest to your customers, especially ones that have given you over 4 grand total and word of mouth business. But his response was ""hey I got family to feed. Real car owners don't care about the price, they just let me do my job.""

This guy is complete crook. We end up telling him to just put the car back together because we never consented to him taking anything extra apart or doing any other extra work, and he says ""fine, but you still need to pay the $330."" What? Pay for you taking something apart even though you never fixed it the first time and it was not consented to? 

He tells my brother he spoke with my father and he consented to it, and that same day he tells my father he spoke to my brother who consented to it. When they called each other, both my brother and father both said that Scott never asked for consent on either sides to take the car apart, so now he's just lying to customers to cover his mistake up and charge for it?? 

We tell him, don't fix anything, just put the car back together.

Another week passes and finally he puts the car back together. So now it's been a total of over 3 weeks just to look at a low window washer fluid light. Any real mechanic fixes an issue the first time and when it's returned they don't try to charge you again. They also don't proceed with working on your car after a diagnostic without consenting to it first and informing you.

Unfortunately there's no quality, customer service, or honor at Monaghan's. So there's no redeeming quality about this place what so ever unfortunately. I paid over $2300 on something I wish I could have taken elsewhere to do for nearly 1/3 less, and something that the mechanic possibly could have broken with out my knowledge of. If you're looking for quality work, or even to just be treated like a human being instead of a money pot, don't go or trust anything from Monaghan's.

There's so many other better mechanics that you don't have to risk your car at.

Also as a last note, during the entire dispute they also took a picture (again without consent) of my brother's car for their advertisement on their yelp page."
4.5,5,Excellent mechanic service. Took my truck in. Treated me extremely well and didn't gouge my wallet. Highly recommend
4.5,1,"Since getting my car back every once in a while at full stops I notice the car idle for a second or two a little rough and return back to normal idle.

You tend to know your own car, the way it idles, the feel, sound..ect

And today as I drove a friend in my car I told them to silence the radio and stop talking so I could hear my car idle; low and behold literally the second after I said that, the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT turned on. I was in a parking lot and told him to follow me home, as soon as I got there my car now won't turn on.

Engine code indicates problem with some cam part. Now I'm going to have to pull the information tomorrow and see what it is

I just paid $2300 to have a single new cam done and repairs and now I'm having cam issues.
Changed the battery, alternator, cam position sensor, checked all wiring and fuses, and according to everything.. the cam timing is off. Belts are good..

So tell me again how this is the same review? Dated 11/6/18

There's warranty but I have a feeling if I take it back to them, they're going to claim it's a new issue that isn't related to their so called ""repairs"" and charge me another bogus price. I'm very unhappy this is happening, I work full time and I don't have time for this nonsense after coming home from a 12 hour work day.

They give crooked mechanics a bad name."
4.5,5,"Asked them for a 2nd opinion and they saved me a lot of money, had suspicions about the old place I was going to and they confirmed it. Fast, honest, helpful people. Will refer people to them in the future as well as return.  Thank you for the brakes"
4.5,1,"THESE GUYS ARE COMPLETE RIP OFF CROOKS!

They never fixed any of the issues on my vehicle, they ignore all forms of contact other than a quick ""fake"" reply here on yelp reviews to pretend they are addressing disgruntled customers, and worst of all they charge ridiculous prices and pass it off as quality.

The only thing they care about is their yelp review that is most likely maintained by family and friends making fake reviews to give them 5 stars, well here is a REAL CUSTOMER with a REAL ISSUE that is not being address. I got ripped off coming and paying for a service that was never given. I will never come back!

There a hundreds of better 5 star quality mechanics around that you can go to instead."
4.5,1,"I wanted to post an update just to say that I recently just checked my garage, and my Vette is STILL leaking oil! This was the original repair that cost me over $900 and was taken back twice already! Scott claimed it was still leaking due to an oil filter that they put on wrong and I took it back to him to fix. Well, apparently that wasn't true because it is STILL leaking oil! This would be the third time he did not properly fix my vehicle! That's not even including the $330 charge without asking my permission on the Coolant sensor. So I spent nearly $1400 with NO repairs done to my vehicle and the ownership isn't answering my Yelp messages over the last month nor have they called back! Reporting to my credit card company! Avoid at all costs!"
4.5,1,"Had them install new injectors in my truck and they gave me a fair price. I dropped it off Monday late afternoon I was told I would get a call if it was anything else wrong with it besides the Injectors in the morning. I was quoted a price of $946.00 for labor to install glow plugs and injectors I provide. Didn't get a call the next day so I figured there was nothing wrong with it besides the parts I provided. Wed I called about noon bc I still had not heard from them and scott (owners brother in law) answers the phone and he said that there will be an extra charge for an oil change, no problem I told him.. I was told it could get done in 1 day and I'm already in the 2nd day and I'm still ok with it bc my truck is going to get fixed. a couple hrs later scott calls me and says it needs another part and it cost a couple hundred $$, I'm thinking my bill is up to $1,300 ...wasn't more than 2 hrs past when scott calls me and tells me my truck is finished. He says it runs great. I get there and get my bill and it's $1,500.00+ I'm a lil puzzled bc the price I was quoted is now $1000+ for labor and I asked scott that's not the price you quoted me and he made a couple of excuses that made no sense but I still was ok fine take the money I just want my work truck back. As I'm driving home I was so happy that my truck was running well again, I go straight home and get out of my truck and my neighbor and son walk over to talk about my truck.. I pushed my door to close lightly and it didn't close. As I looked at my door I could see a dimple under the mirror on my door panel and as I looked closer I could see that there were 4 more dings on my door and you could tell it was hyperextended like they were backing it out of their garage and caught the wall. I was willing to look past getting overcharged and even giving them a chance to work on all of our work trucks but being dishonest to the customer and letting him leave with a damaged truck that happened in their shop. Just kills me bc I felt this was an honest shop. I took my truck back the next morning and actually talked to the mechanic who worked on my truck and I was calm and professional. I showed him the damage done to my truck and he didn't deny not doing it he just said he didn't notice it and I was calm when I told him that a lot of people worked on my truck lately and can testify that my truck did not have a damaged door. After I said that he said it most likely happened when he was working on it. Just as I was getting ready to leave scott showed up. He had a different deminer towards me like I came to bug him. He denied it happened there after I showed him the damage to the door. I showed him up close how the damaged had happened recently bc the paint was literally flaking off around the damaged areas. I told him I just wanted it fixed or credit back some money to my account and I'll fix it my self. The door is out of wack  and you need to slam it for it to close and there is physical damaged visible also. I told him I talked to your guy who worked on it and he told me it most likely happen when he was working on it. I know he knew about the damage bc at no time did he asked me who I had talked to about it or did he call the mechanic over to question him about it. That is being dishonest and shady. Scott told me to give him a couple days for his painter to call him back so they could fix my damaged door.. This happened 8/8/18 it's now 8/16/18 and no call from scott to make this right. Customer beware"
4.5,5,"On a Coast to Coast move our truck started making a knocking noise 40 miles out from Vegas. Vegas was supposed to be a quick stop trip but we were stranded, first thing Monday morning we started calling every shop. No one could get us in, except Monaghan's. As my husband pulled into the parking lot, Scott was outside and heard the noise, before my husband had filled out all of the paperwork, Scott had figured out the issue. Now to find the part, which was proving to be impossible. No one had it. Scott called Dodge and the part was going to be $1,000!!! He said start looking online for someone who could over night the part. So Scott and my husband both started searching. A part was found for $170 out of New York, but could be sent over night. Well we missed the overnight deadline but still got the part in less than 2 days. We picked up the part at FedEx at 9:40, dropped it off with Scott at 10:00 and he called saying we were good to go before 11:00am!!! Couldn't ask for better or faster service. Thank you for getting us back on the road!"
4.5,2,"My wife had an automobile failure disaster while travelling through Las Vegas.

We took the vehicle to Monaghan's and were trying to figure out how to solve it.  I was asking him questions about the repair because we were very low on funds, and he got really upset and yelled at her ""Does your husband want me to tell him how to do his job?""

I had only asked him questions, so I don't know how that qualifies as ""telling him how to do his job""

We took our vehicle somewhere else and are very happy about that."
4.5,5,Scott has been maintaining my Altima for the past 8 years. He is very knowledgeable and takes the time to explain any issues and options for repair. I trust him implicitly and highly recommend him - he is ASE certified and open Mon-Sat.
4.5,1,"Completely dishonest mechanics.
If their condescending treatment to customers in person and off public pages don't turn you off, then their receipt will once you find hidden costs that will more than triple their initial quote.
You won't have a choice either, they'll begin your repairs and you wont find out until the card is swiped and your car is back in your hands.

Their response? ""Hey, you asked to have it repaired. If you want quality that's how it works."" Rude and deceptive.

I was never told the price was going to change mid-way through the repairs, there was no consent to the new bill. Also I found new damages and scratches on my car, but they are denying it was them and blaming it on myself. I know my own car and these were not there prior.

I wish I would give negative stars instead, 1 star is too generous."
3,2,Just got here dryers don't work and huge slope in the pull though lots and no fires feels like a parking lot
3,4,"Stayed during Stampede week. Nice distance from town and still easy to get to the city center 20 minutes away. It would be great if the city could extend its bike paths toward the Olympic park nearby, then one could ride bikes clear to town from campgrounds.  As it is there is a park and bike lot just a few miles away.  Campground provided a shuttle to stampede grounds twice a day$16 per person over 6 yrs. Green lots, nice trees growing. Clean updated bathrooms. Little pool for fun with the kids, not too cold.  Roads are gravel and ran rivulets during the hard rains this week. Friendly employees even though they were super busy.  We'll come again."
3,2,"The campground is a very crowded ""city"" campground as my kids would call it. The pool is fairly small, though we didn't use it. And the mini golf was tiny as well, again we didn't do it because it was not included in the cost of the stay. 

The bathrooms are closed at set hours for cleaning and yet when I went back in the shower stall had stuff stuck to it that clearly had been there a while. They were outdated and felt dirty. One of the toilets has a steady leak from the toilet tank meaning the floor was always wet. 

The sites are tiny and you end up with tents 10 feet or less from you. But all that I would have overlooked if the sites had been clean, but they were covered in cigarette butts!  So gross.

If you simply need a place to stay while in the city, it will work. But for the amount of money I spent on it, I have seen much much nicer faculties and play areas. While the location was handy, for the cost and the amount of people they had shoved in there they should be able to improve vastly from where they are."
3,4,"Second rv campground I've stayed at ever on my first trip with my new travel trailer.  Tons of pull through sites makes it easy for people new to trailing. Nice views and even though you feel like you're camping, you're still pretty close to town. Close to callaway park, the zoo, the science centre, all kinds of activities for the family, and they are in the process of building a big climbing gym within walking distance of this place. All this and just over an hour drive to Banff to see the mountains for the day.  
Free showers is a huge thing, not the greatest looking but clean and the water is hot and lots of room to change. 
The pool was closed but we were here in September so I understand. I will be back here next year for sure."
5,5,"If you are looking for a fair, reliable mobile RV repair service, Scot at Kiss My RV is your guy. He called me the day of the service as promised, diagnosed the problem and fixed it in no time all of which was done at a very fair price. Since I know RV repair needs are a given... I can assure you that I'll be using them in the future (hopefully not too soon) ;)"
5,5,"Scott at Kiss My RV Repair is an incredible RV repairman!  We found him to be very knowledgeable and dependable. He has gone over and above with diagnosing a 3-way refrigerator that has had issues that others have not been able to fix.  Never give up until the issues were found and the problems were fixed.  Yeah Scott for being the hero, you are a great business man!  So grateful we found you."
5,5,Thank god we found them!! They fixed a problem with our jacks that no one else could fix. Jayco and Little dealer sold us a product that was inadequate and KISS My Rv was the only ones to take the time and find a perfect solution . Plus they did it quickly and fit in some maintenance for us too. Don't go anywhere else they are the best
5,5,"Just picked up my Travel Trailer from getting some de-lamination in the front repaired which was a factory flaw in the fiberglass allowing moisture to get in.  Kelly explained how he was going to repair my trailer and that it would never have the same issue again!  Very knowledgeable and repairs were made with quality workmanship and the customer in mind. My coach has a better than new look and I am VERY HAPPY with ""Kiss My Rv Repair"" and the service I received!"
4,5,"Fantastic experience! 

Charity was great and super helpful at check-in. The sites are beautiful and relaxing. Especially appreciate the clean bathrooms with good water pressure in the showers after a long day on the road. They were also welcoming to my dog, even have a doggie pool in the dog park where he could cool off! :) If ever back in Ohio we will stay here again. :)"
4,4,"This used to be Yogi Bears Jellystone Park. It changed its name last summer. Gone are the bears and other cartoon characters. What remains is a beautiful lake with fishing, boating and swimming. Bath houses and restrooms are clean. This is a great place for group camping   Also has several sites for company picnics  Seasonal sites are available  Sites are well kept. Themed weekends are fun. The swimming pool is nice and works well with the on duty life guards. The snack bar serves a limited menu of burgers and ice cream. The gift shop and ranger station is woeful. Hard to find those last minute supplies you may have forgotten. Gone are the pancake breakfasts that used to be fun on weekends. The arts and crafts activities are lame as well. The miniature golf course needs help. Overall, good, but could be great with a few upgrades."
4,5,"Having been to all of the local places and having countless issues, we were desparate for a new option. We found this place and it is amazing. I have not been here long, but this place is amazing. We have been to Crystal Rock in Sandusky for a season and American Wilderness for a couple of seasons and this place, in just a couple of weeks puts all other local places to shame! I will start by saying that this place is clean, so clean that I almost couldn't believe they maintained their grounds this well. The lake is amazing, the pool is beautiful. They offer free lessons. The ice cream man pulls in on weekend afternoons, there are tons of activities, just this weekend there was a carnival. There are a few comments below about people who have made their seasonal sites too permanent. We found that this is what makes this place so nice. The couple people we met have been coming for between 25 and 45 years. That means that the people treat this like their homes, taking pride in private and public areas, watching out for you, helping with setups and just generally being neighborly. On top of all of that, with such a beautiful lake, hills and pool there is nothing as nice as this park anywhere within an hour or more from Cleveland."
4,1,"This RV Park sucks! Most of the people are either permanent or seasonal which is fine. They take really good care of their sites, but don't let the looks deceive you! It's the prettiest sucky place we've ever been! The problem is they give the decent sites to people who live there and leave the rest for travelers. Every available site is on a hillside! Just try and level a rig on a hill! The sewer is at the top of that hill! Ever try to drain your tanks with the sewer up hill? Yeah, it doesn't work!!! It wasn't just us. Every short term traveler we spoke with had the same problem. If you're looking for a place to live or vacation long term, this is your spot. It's pretty and lots to do, that is if you don't mind the smell when the people passing though try to empty their tanks and it spills all over the ground! If you're just passing through, keep going!"
4,4,"Just had a nice weekend here... Camped in a pop-up with wife & kids. Last minute deal & the sites they assigned us ( 2 popups side by side) were lacking shade but otherwise pretty good....can't complain for last minute as the local state parks were full.   Busy barn was great for the crafty girls, as was a. scheduled kickball game for my son, pool and beach were welcomed in the heat of the day, and we even had a decent go at fishing..... Friday night was a bit loud with a few camp sites partying on, but have had worse neighbors...Saturday was better...Will be back, great close to home family get away.....late night noise, average sized sites, and restrooms getting trashed during the day Saturday are keeping this from being a 5 star......but we will be back."
4,4,"I still love this campground & it offers so much to do with the whole family, but the last couple of times I have been here, the restrooms were not as clean as usual & the pool was dirty. We were there at the pool the first thing in the morning & it looked like the pool and area surrounding it was not even cleaned from the day before. There were lots of bugs floating in the water, clumps of hair & old band aids, not only in the pool, but on the cement area around the pool. We actually found it disgusting & left after an hour to go to the lake. If they pay more attention to this area, I would go back to my five star rating. We will probably go someplace with a cleaner pool next time. We have been very disappointed the past couple times with this."
4,5,"So much to do here! LIVE music on the weekends, we try to make it here every year! Check out their calendar for the weekends good times!
Camp on!"
4,3,"This is a big, and nice campground.  It has a beach, and a big ""lake"" to catch and release fish, a decent pool, however, the sites are pretty close together to the point we worried about the people's fire next to us with ambers hitting the tonou cover on the truck.  Their quiet time is to start in an hour we shall see.  Their is about 6 tents set up across us (all together) very loud, setting off fireworks.  Just very noisy all around.  I realize folks want to have a good time, but it should be done with being considerate to others. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so close together..ppl in pop-up have been BLARING music since they set up..wonder why the staff isn't enforcing policies.....??"
4,4,"Options in the Mantua area for an RV park are limited. Fortunately, the Roundup Lake RV Resort was there for us after a long day of travel. The reviews for RLRR on TripAdvisor run the gamut, though the newer reviews are probably the most accurate and reflect new management.  Our first time at the Roundup Lake RV Resort, we saw a clean, well-maintained park with a friendly staff. If my travels again take me through this part of Ohio, I'll be back."
4,5,"Great camping experience. We do a lot of camping & after spending the weekend there, this place is at the top of our list. The campground offers so much to do. It is very family/kid friendly. Our site was larger than most campgrounds offer. The bathrooms were very clean. There was a nice pool, swimming beach with lots of sand & we took a rowboat out on the lake. The price was good, staff friendly & helpful. I can say nothing bad about my time at Roundup Lake. I can't wait to go back again."
4,4,"Very nice RV park that had all the attributes we look for: quiet, adult-oriented (not too many kids in Oct/Nov); level spots; spotless facilities (bathroom/showers/laundry, etc); nice scenery, especially from the perimeter sites where you don't have anyone behind you; security patrolled; AND, the best part, yummy donuts every morning! Front desk was very friendly and helpful when we needed to extend our stay due to unexpected medical appointments. Be aware that the park gets very busy after the first of the year, so you probably want to call ahead if you want to stay for an extended length of time. We planned for 3 nights and ended up staying 11 nights and would definitely come back here."
4,5,"we stayed here in August 2014 on our way to Ft Huachuca to see our son graduate form AIT. The neighborhood was wonderful, the casino was across the street (we didn't go because we were too tired- but it was nice to have the option), the scenery was very pretty, and the staff were just as friendly and wonderfully accommodating as you can get. It was quiet, and it had a great laundry room and the pool area was pretty nice. There was a gas station right down the street, but we didn't see a regular store nearby. Then again, we only stayed one night so it wasn't a crisis. If I were to be RV'ing in the area again, I would stay here again."
4,2,"Nice place marred by the little things. They call themselves a ""resort"", I don't agree. While the view is nice, there are a variety of things wrong with this place. Below is a summarized Pros & Cons.

Pros:
+Nice view 
+Surrounded by nature 
+Close enough to town to get stuff 
+24 hour security 
+Generally acceptable facilities (more on that below)
+Friendly staff 
+utilities included 

Cons:
-Showers are often dirty, seem to only be cleaned once or twice a week. Hard to tell but I once saw the same dead bug on the wall for 2 weeks. 
-Showers have no hot water in the winter! 
-Shower doors sometimes don't lock correctly. Had a bad experience in one of the showers when some dude walked in on me. 
-while the staff is friendly, nothing seems to even get fixed in less than a week. 
-Wifi is slow and only works half the time. Don't rely on it for work or even Netflix. 

Summary: 2 stars might seem extreme, but you only have to pay for an ice cold shower a couple times before you hate a place. While the joint is nice compared to some really crappy RV parks, Eagle View falls short of its potential due to substandard cleaning (for a resort) and generally lack luster maintenance of the very facility (showers s) that could make them above the rest."
4,5,Excellent upscale RV Park by the McDowell Mountains. Very Clean facility and free breakfast everyday
4,5,"Beautiful resort,  pet friendly and office friendly,  clean,  and quiet! Highly recommend! Visit nearby Fountain Hills and the casino for fantastic food and fun all year round. Beautiful views of the mountains.  Dog park, computer center,  library,  pool table,  TV,  beautiful laundry room,  nice workout gym,  heated pool and Jacuzzi,  complimentary coffee and donuts every morning,  great hiking and walking trails, rv storage across the street, friendly office staff,  tennis, horse shoe pit,  basketball courts,  picnic area and propane BBQ for eagle view customers,  lots of wild horses,  cows,  javelina and roadrunners often seen throughout the area. Phenomenal office staff."
4,5,"Nestled at the foot of some mountains in Fountain Hills, Eagle View RV Resort is the nicest RV park in the Phoenix area without an age restriction.

Nice flat and level spots, friendly and helpful staff, and tons of amenities.

Amenities: fenced-in dog park, gym, laundry, pool and hot tub, tennis and b-ball courts, horse shoe pits, and a club house with a business center. Serve complimentary coffee and donuts in the mornings.

The only downside is the distance to Scottsdale and Chandler. Leave yourself 30-45 minutes to get into those towns (depending on traffic).

Great park!"
4,5,"The best RV resort in AZ.  Far enough away from the hustle of the big city but close to great restaurants in fountain hills.  If you can get a site, this is the best place to stay in this area."
4,1,"Nice Views
Dog run could be bigger
Exercise ""room"" is claustrophobic
Laundry room smells of mold
People have had cold showers
Ice machine seems to be broken
Hot tub seems to be broken
Mail pickup will be limited due to stress on staff

Absence of the truth is a lie, which leads to harrasement."
4,2,"This camp ground has a lot of seasonal people.   Most are retired and living here.   It's kind of like staying in a SR. Living community.   Quiet hours are pretty much all day and they aren't really dog friendly, however they do provide doggy bags and a small dog park.   No campfires... be sure to whisper when you talk!!!   Not a campground I would recommend unless you just want to sleep there and go to the casino.   You can walk to the casino but there's no sidewalks or lights.  I only gave it a 2 rating due to the clients at the campground and the strict no fun rules!   The campground itself is adequate.   However my cable did not work."
4,3,"Certainly one of the best parks in the NE Phoenix Metropolitan area. On the Fort McDowell Indian reservation. I was lucky enough to get one of the sites along the back of the property, which in my opinion are the best. All the sites are asphalt, and mine proved to be fairly level. I arrived here on October 1st and stayed for 3 months. November and December weather was delightful, but October was still pretty damn hot, and sitting on a black asphalt site made it seem even hotter. I can't even imagine staying here in the hot part of the year (about 8 months). The wifi was decent, better than most parks. They just recently upgraded it. Honestly, in my experience, the wifi in most parks is usually not very good anyway.

Things I really liked: 

Lots of wildlife show up on park grounds, especially along the back. I saw Javelinas, wild horses, coyotes, road runners, and yes, skunks. Lots of hummingbirds as well. The views of the Four Peaks mountain range to the North is awesome.

Grounds are well kept. Most of the help is very nice (read on).

Things I didn't like:

1) Don't bend the rules. The manager of this park can be very nice, but if you make a mistake, or don't follow the rules to the letter, you'll soon find out about it. Example 1 - a friend of mine was rudely threatened with immediate eviction because he let his very friendly dog off leash for just a few minutes. Example 2 - I put up a pop up tent to park my car under in the heat of October, and was told I could not do that, because ""if everyone did that, it would begin to look like a mobile home park"". Funny, I must have seen a dozen other tents used for similar or other  purposes, and yet I was singled out as a violator, and asked to take it down.

Truth is, I find this unfriendly attitude pretty common in many RV parks, especially ones that are busy or popular. The people who manage or work there take their jobs very seriously, often too seriously, and seem to forget that as paying customers, we should be treated more kindly, or with more respect. It seems to me their opinion is, if you don't like it, you can leave, and we'll fill your spot again with no problem.

2) You can't wash your own rig in this park, even if you pay for the extra water. Only their vendors can wash your rigs, and it's not cheap. I was quoted $130 for my 40' motor home, not including the roof. This particular vendor does a lot of work in the park, and his rig is very noisy, so often the serenity of the day is broken by loud compressors, and spray guns. I did NOT appreciate that at all."
4,4,"This is a very nice, clean, well laid out Campground. It's also quiet. The people were pleasant. Good central location for Mayo Clinic, or Phoenix. Casino across road. There are wild horses in the area, they came near the Campground at dusk. 

They have a pool, a tennis court, a workout room, a business office for guests area, a rec room and laundry room. Be warned the washers are double size, and the price reflects the size - $3 to wash is pretty expensive for a regular size load, but not a bad deal if you know in advance and plan your wash accordingly.

We stayed towards the end of May, about $40 a night - but it was too hot to use the pool or tennis court! (That's not the Park's fault - just be warned so you check before you come.)

Overall nice place, I'd stay again."
4,1,"Beware:  When you walk in to register all you hear are all the things you cannot do.  It's like a slap in the face.   Nothing is allowed outside the Rv overnight, ie table with chairs, cooking equipment.    (Keep in mind no one obeys this rule). Do not let your dog out of the Rv without it's leash on... you will be kicked out.   Once you hand them your credit
card there is absolutely NO refund for any reason.  Showers were 'fairly' clean.   There are also no pull throughs... they will not tell you this even when you call to reserve and you specifically request a pull thru.  All I was told is the site was long enough to handle my Rv and tow.  I had to unhook everything and back in.  Awkward for a single person.  I do not recommend this Rv park due to their strict rules that are shoved into your face the moment you walk through their doors along with their no refund policy if you need to leave early or are very unhappy there.  I decided to take the loss and left 2 weeks early."
4,5,Stayed for a month and the place is really well maintained.  WiFi is so-so as it is at most Rv parks - a little better than average.  Pool and spa is nice as is laundry area. Also has a nice community room. Would highly recommend and will stay here again
4,5,"Excellent customer service from Carey! Thank you for being so accommodating. Super nice facility, great views, clean bathroom and showers, secured site. RV sites is closed to casino, groceries and beautiful McDowell park. Full hook up, level sites.
I only wish the place is a little bit more dog friendly. A bit small dog park but not enough to stop me from staying"
4,5,Last August we came to Phoenix and looked at a ton of parks to spend the winter at. We were fortunate to get a spot at this park. The slips are awesome with enough room in between them. Nice area to take the dogs for a walk and the facilities are nice and always clean. We spend about every afternoon at the hot tub and pool and we've met a lot of other great rvr's here.
3.5,4,"Stay focused around here more than the usual amount of trouble in this neighborhood and it can b dangerous to say the least!
On the bright side it's close enough to take the bus if your brave or to the strip or Fremont street experience be safer Stay on the STRIP!"
3.5,4,"We were pleased with this RV park..Tina and her husband were very friendly and helpful,  teaching us about public transportation in LV. I look forward to visiting again..."
3.5,4,"Very accommodating!  we had to adjust our arrival dates and they adjusted without issue.  They also met us after hours at our site to get us the paperwork and keys.  The park does have permanent residents, but they are all in decent condition and that is more a sign of the times than the quality of the Park.  We had plenty of room.  The laundry rooms, showers and bathrooms are very nice and well maintained.  The pool is very refreshing as is the hot tub.  We will gladly return when coming to Vegas again.  We even drove through and checked on other RV parks in the area just to compare.  Price, lot space, facility conditions and location were all compared.  This may not have golf course grass and casino like structures, but we have more space, friendlier atmosphere and don't feel ""forced"" to go to the casinos.  Don't be fooled, a good place to stay."
3.5,2,Don't know that I can classify this park as a Good Sam park. Most units are old and what appear as permanent fixtures in disrepair and the preferred repair tool is duct tape.appears to be a poor working class park with most units in disrepair and surrounded with junk. Good Sam would not be happy with the appearance of this park.
3.5,4,"They have the BEST WiFi!!!!!! Omg it's better than the internet I USED to have in my home! After you stay here a few times, this place grows on you.  It's not as creepy there do have ALOT of long-term residents living at the park."
3.5,3,"Location: check. Weather: check.  Shade: check.  Price: check.  Here for the first of four nights.  Be cautious at ""dog run"", it's got shards of glass.  Dog bags are provided.  Pool and spa open 24 hours, at least for now.  They have a yard next to the laundry room where you can hang your clothes out to dry! Wireless is strong.
I might stay again.
I'm sure this park had its heyday in the 60s and 70s, but it's tired and run down now.  Tina is friendly and welcoming."
3.5,1,"I sent them a mail asking about availability, and provided all information.
They emailed me back saying they have ""some questions"" and asked me to call back. 

When I did, they said they do not allow 5 people in a site.
Ok... where's the question? Couldn't they just write that back to me? Am I supposed to drop the children somewhere else?

Ridiculous, and presents poor customer service."
3.5,5,Stayed hear last year  when we returned this year me and my family was surprised to see how many improvements that the new ownership has done with the place I absolutely love the location perfect spot close to casinos shopping and everything you need not to mention the best rates in town I will definitely be returning
3.5,3,"Well, this RV park is kinda creepy...in a way.  Karen, the park manager was nice.  The bathrooms are BIG and the showers are nice and clean.  Perfect place if you have a older trailer or a full-time RVer."
3.5,1,Worst place ever. The office hours are whenever his rude lady decides. So unprofessional. Will try to close early so you can't pay your rent on time. No wonder they got bought out.
3.5,5,Great location in about five minutes from the strip in eight minutes from downtown Fremont Street stayed here for four nights very friendly staff just got took over by new management in new owners they have great plans for the community would definitely come back and stay bathrooms are clean!!! pool area nice oh and can't forget mini (dotty's) across the street for late nights LOL if you like video poker Also if you're coming to park little tip enter off of boulder highway and St. Louis to Palm because Sahara you have to make a U-turn because one ways Saharas OK if you're coming westbound and you can just enter off of Palm
3.5,4,"Very clean, organized, friendly and quiet atmosphere and the prices are very reasonable. The best part is the bathrooms are very clean, spacious, and airconditioned (VERY important in Vegas in June). Hook ups as advertised and management is very accommodating and understanding (We are RV rookies). It is a little difficult to get there in an RV as there is no left turns allowed from Sahara to Palm street - you'll need to go long and make a U-turn. Some local friends said it was in a bad area of town but we saw no evidence of that. We'll be back here to stay again for sure."
3.5,5,Under new management and it is fabulous the staff is friendly grounds are clean and very safe we love the this RV Community we are definitely coming back
3.5,1,"if there was a zero star i would have picked it.  started out okay, but by second day i knew i had picked the wrong place.  new management was awful, started screaming at me and my wife, i called all the way to the top to try and get settled including the mcgavin family and nothing was done.  i was lied to, yelled and and disrespected and will never give them the time of day, beware, there was a reason the place was empty, my bad@!!!!! lesson learned."
3,1,"BEWARE ~ Poor or no service. Warranty work. We were originally told it would take 2 days and we finally pulled it out at almost 2 months. They broke and bent things put holes in panels then blamed it on us...unbelievable!!!

Miss Tiffany, Customer Service, bent over to pick up the $20 it would cost to fix the paneling meanwhile letting us know on not let less than 5 occasions her techs didn't do it. Well it wasn't that way when we rolled in so we plan on letting all our friends in multiple parks throughout the east valley know as well as Facebook RV groups, Jayco forums, Escapees and various other publications along the way.

Now this was not the only problem. There are other items left on done. 

To be fair there were a few items that they fixed.  We'll see if they hold.  It doesn't matter we will never go back there."
3,1,"I live full time in my travel trailer. I have had this in the service department three times now and every time I get it back something else goes wrong. This time I asked that a slide out window lock be fixed, it was not, I have to SLAM it shut for the window to lock, however they did install the shade to the slide out window that was broken from before. I requested that the under carriage be reattached in the corner to keep pest out as I was told that this model was completely enclosed to keep varmints out. This is the second time I asked for this, it still was not done. I asked to have my propane tanks filled and when I picked up the RV, I was told that they were filled but when I got back to the RV Park and tried to turn on my stove there was no propane in one tank and half empty in the other. Now my city water leaks and fills up my potable water tank which then is draining out of my overflow valve which floods my lot space and makes the managers unhappy. I also asked for this to be fixed the first time, second time and it still is not fixed. I asked for a print out of the work that was done but was told everything was fixed under warranty. There's more but I'm too tired and disappointed to go on."
3,5,"We recently purchased a Jayco travel trailer at World Wide RV.  We've been RVing for many years and have owned several new and used units.  We expected a few problems with a new unit but we didn't expect to receive such excellent service from Leslie when we brought it in.  Leslie is very knowledgable about RV's and went above and beyond to get our unit done.  Leslie even pointed out some discrepancies in the RV that we didn't see and took care of those for us too!  I've bought a lot of cars/trucks and RV's over the years and I've never had such good service from an individual.  Leslie called when our unit was finished and explained that it may take some time to get parts from Indiana (where the trailers are made) so we understood everything before leaving our unit.  I couldn't be happier with Leslie's service and when it comes time to have the unit serviced again, I'll make an appointment with her as she gets the job done and does what she says!

When we bought the RV, our sales person, Sam was very well spoken and knew a lot about the Jayco line and what was in stock at the time.  We told him what we wanted and he showed us the 24RKS and it fit the bill for us perfectly.  Sam was excellent...no pushy at all and he let us make our decision in private.  

If Sam and Leslie are indicative of all of the employees at World Wide RV, well, then there's no reason to go anywhere else.  Clearly, these two are the best I've ever worked with when buying/servicing an RV."
3,5,"My husband had been searching for our first toy hauler for a couple of months.   He finally decided on Jayco.    He went into WWRV and spoke w/Greg Pope.  When he came home, he couldn't say enough good things about Greg.  He said Greg was very knowledgeable.  A week ago, we went in to check some Jayco's out and I had the pleasure of meeting Greg.   I've read a few bad reviews on here about the sales people and I guess they weren't as fortunate as us bq we can't say one bad thing about Greg.   I hope to be able to say the same thing about the service dept in the future."
3,1,"We purchased a brand-new 2015 motorcoach. The purchase process was pretty easy considering we were paying cash. Our trouble started immediately once we picked up and did our inspection. We still, after two years, have problems with the same items. One item in particular they have replaced seven times and still haven't figured out how to do it properly. This company is so incompetent with service that even the corporate office at Jayco recommended we go somewhere else because of so many complaints they have had. 

We just recently had more service done and they have done more damage to the vehicle then fixing. They installed an entire window and it was crooked, damaged, and you could see the internal parts of the RV wall . The text said that he did not have the proper tools to do it properly. Seriously? Why would you even do something like this if you don't have the right tools. The service technician who I found working on my vehicle admitted he wasn't even a service technician but rather someone that worked in cleaning new units for buyers. He also did not know anything about safety features that we asked to be repaired, to which he bent the safety bar making it completely useless and potential he hazardous on the stove.

I have given the owner many chances at my business and it has been nothing but talk. Their craftsmanship is worse than my kids school work projects and I have photos to prove that I can post later.

They installed event on my roof with my purchase. It kept rattling and I had them inspected and they told me they use the wrong screws. It eventually fell off and now they will not warranty their work.

Stay very far away from this place. I don't think I've ever seen such incompetence in a business anywhere. It's a wonder that they're still in business.

Even their service manager quit!  You know that's a bad sign. 

WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!
We are going to purchase a new unit somewhere else...too bad because their sales folks were decent people."
3,5,"I've had to take my trailer in a few time for service, and every time Leslie is amazing! She is always extremely helpful and explains the process thoroughly.  It's never fun when something breaks, but it's nice to know Leslie is always there to make it better. 
Thank you Leslie for all your help!!!"
3,1,"Very friendly but that's where it ends. Dealer prep was not done. Cabinet hardware loose and stripped. Water heater temp regulator not functioning. Toilet paper holder fell off the wall. Kitchen faucet leaks. The response?  ""Well, it's a man-made product. Bring it in."""
3,5,"I visited World Wide Rv and purchased a preowned travel trailer. Rick the Sales Manager did a good job giving us the confidence we needed to insure no problems at the pick up time. He gave us a 90 warranty but we never had too use it. 
Everything went well. So happy!"
3,5,"I have not visited the sales floor, the service center, or even shopped for anything at the actual location.  I found this location based on a Google search for parts for a trailer I bought.  They make sure the parts are compatible with your trailer, order any special parts needed, and call back when they say they will call back.   Top notch place for online business.  Friendly staff all around.  I'd definitely do business with them in the future if I need trailer parts.  Their prices for shipping are a bit steep though."
3,5,We were greeted by Cordell Secrist.  We told him we were there to look for a future purchase.  We saw several fifth wheels and enjoyed talking with Cordell. No pressure or pushiness. We will be back! Thanks Cordell!! The main thing is we were comfortable with Cordell and we did not leave unhappy and say we will never go back there like other places we went to.
3,1,"These folks have destroyed our RV. We took it in for warranty work in 2016. It took over 2 months. They put a hole in our paneling as you walk in the door...of course they denied it and blamed it on us and did not fix it. They bent a bracket on the main living room slide and did not fix it . They never fixed the levelers that we took it in for. Are you starting to see a pattern here. We had to have another dealer take care of it out of warranty and work it out with the manufacturer. Trim fell off of the ceiling between the dealership and the 5 miles to the park we were staying at. We fixed it. They cleaned out the refrigerator and my bottle of perfume was ""thrown"" out. Last but not least they unfortunately painted the back and cone of the RV. It's almost been two years. They informed me it's out of warranty. Of course! I didn't expect anything else from this establishment. I've never seen anything like this before. This is disgusting I can't even sell it. I'm not writing this to be vindictive. I'm writing this to save others from going through what we've been through. Find a reputable dealer."
3,1,"Wish I could give a negative star rating.....I almost broke a blood vessel in my forehead getting mad. We had a very painful/goofy sales experience with them a few months ago. My wife still cannot stop talking about it. When we bought a Jayco trailer (someplace else) I lost my memory and brought it here for service. They are a major Jayco service provider in the area......one goofy sales guy probably didn't represent the whole business....that was my thinking anyway. So now maybe one goofy service manager probably doesn't define the total business either, but crappy service is still crappy service. Save your blood pressure pills and take your trailer down the street to Cassone's RV, formerly known as Smooth Finish."
3,5,"we have been in the market for a, rv when we came in touch with, codell seacrist at world wide rv, he really took care of us and went way out of his way to get us not only what we wanted but,what we needed,also i cant say enough about the parts dept as well as others P&J L of show low,az"
3,5,"My husband and I have been looking for a motorhome for some time.  We found World Wide RV in Mesa AZ and walked away with a beautiful used motorhome.  From the minute we stepped on their lot we had great service.  We were shown a coach in our price range, our salesman Greg Pope was very helpful showing us see everything inside and out he worked side by side with the finance team to secure our loan. The concerns we had are being addressed and fixed while in the final inspection and detail before we take possession.  I recommend them to anyone who is looking for a new or used recreation vehicle."
3,5,"I have been all over looking for the perfect 5th wheel travel trailer.  I was looking for certain features and was on a tight budget. Sam Strok took a lot of time with us and helped us pick out the exact one we wanted.
We needed some modifications done to the camper before we picked it up so we also had a chance to deal with the service department. Everybody was knowledgeable and friendly."
3,1,"Went to this and it's sister location, neither wanted to help us. First location said they didn't have tent trailers while we were standing right next to one (awkward). Ho-hummed and when I asked if they were open he said, ""for 8 more minutes"" so he just didn't want to help us. He sent us to worldwide rv down the road (their sister store) and when we pulled up (5min before closing) they ran and locked the office door. When you're looking to spend $30k on a trailer, you expect some service right?! Go to little dealer little prices-they treated us so well-I know where we'll be buying from!"
3,5,"We live in California, but we bought our Jayco trailer from World Wide RV in Mesa, Arizona because they were able to give us the best price. 

Brian Dacey could not have been more accommodating, conducting the entire transaction by phone and email. 

After a shake down trip we had several warranty related problems that needed to be addressed and Leslie in the service department stepped up to make sure everything taken care of for us. We came from California for this work and it was worth the time and expense. 

We brought Leslie a list of problems that exceeded the time they had allocated to us, but they made time and completed the list. 

The service department also let our bird Willow stay in the air conditioning while we reviewed the work done with Leslie."
3,1,"That may be true but I was dealing with YOU not the manufacturer. Your company should know or at least investigate the shipping costs and allow the customer to decide at that point if they still want the item. I wasn't given that choice. You charged me for it and sent a copy of the invoice including shipping in the package when it arrived. You certainly had many weeks to find out what it would have cost to ship it. If I contact your company to purchase an item you should be responsible for the entire transaction, not place the blame on a third party. That's bad business practice. I appreciate that you want to explain but you did tge charging on my cc... not Jayco"
3,5,"I bought my trailer at a different location which was my first mistake, no other dealer would help me as i didn't buy it from them. I have never understand that rule! After talking to Camping World and Little Dealer Little Prices, I came down and spoke with Leslie who had no issues with me not purchasing the trailer somewhere else. She was more than willing to help me, she looked at my trailer issues via pictures, explained the process of appointments, drop off and approx the time the unit would be down. It's frustrating the timeline but she laid it out so I understood why and even gave me her email so I could go home walk through my trailer and make a list so we could make the most of the time while the trailer was there.

I also found out they have a body shop and a fabricator right one site! One stop shop, so I can also get my blow out issue fixed as well since I am running it through insurance. I've read through these reviews, most are very good and I am happy to say I agree. I look forward to working with Leslie and her crew. Completely worth the 65 minute drive knowing I am going to be taken care."
3,1,PLEASE CHECK YOUR SPARE TIRE BEFORE YOU LEAVE.I bought a new coach there and the first service I had they took my brand new tire and put a used split tire under my trailer.Please be aware
3,5,"Love these guys. I've dealt with them several times. I've never actually bought anything from them yet. I'm sure I will some day, but our numbers just haven't met yet. 

Nice guys, great atmosphere, and they don't lie about their campers. I give them my max price, they negotiate to try to get there and when we don't meet, they are always polite and say maybe next time..."
3,5,"Leslie, taking care of her customers... Parts department nearly always have just what I'm looking for... or can get it! Great service.."
3,1,"Absolutely the least reputable and dishonest dealership in the valley.  My parents bought a brand new RV the other week and thus far we are clocking 60+ items being wrong/broken.  Things like the flooring peeling back, bathroom mirror falling off the wall, inch+ gaps in the siding and roof, missing fuses, etc.   These guys are absolutely fraudulent in their dealings.   I would be highly suspect in buying a toy RV from this outfit."
3,4,I have a little VW eurovan that I needed to have a curtain rod replaced in.  I had gone to several other rv places and they couldn't be bothered with such a small job.  Not only did these guys do it but since it was such a small job they handled it right away.  Nice service and I didn't even buy my van through them.  Glad to have them around.
3,5,Once again World Wide RV saves the day! I have a mobile pet grooming business and generator issues are a constant. Leslie in services gets me in and the guys getting dirty get me out so fast. I am so glad I have them to get my business back up and running.
3,1,"I bought a NEW 2017 Jayco Pinnacle from World Wide RV. It has been the biggest nightmare I have ever gone through. When I took delivery there were parts of the unit missing and was promised they would be replaced immediately. That was February 6th 2018. The tires were worn much more than the 1500 miles from factory to Mesa AZ. They have tried to blame Jayco and that didn't work they tried to get the axle factory to replace axles so I could get new tires on a new coach. When that didn't work the service manager tried to give me undersized tires that someone had taken off a new coach that they didn't want.  Why do I want something someone else didn't want. This is a 39 ft coach. When I bucked him on the tires, he told me he would not offer me nothing. DON't be stupid like me and buy from World Wide. Once they get your money, it is GOOD BYE AND KISS YOUR BEHIND FOR ANY WARRANTY. I farmed for 40 yrs and a trucking business on the side. I am not an idiot like they wanted to think I am. Time to get an attorney. They are a bunch of crooks. Sick of their run-a-round"
3,1,I should give zero stars for this place. They kept our trailer for 5 weeks for work that could have been done in one day. The work that they did do was sub par. They just straight didn't do some work we asked for that would have made them an extra $300( they did not even tell us  they were not going to do it we found out when we showed up. This was also the work we were really concerned with). Their customer service is horrible in that they never communicate with you or each other. Please pray you never have to get repairs or warranty work done here ever. The only time they are pleasent or attentive is when they are selling to you an RV which is why I left the one star.
3,1,I ordered a part (a simple bent pole) for my pop up camper. This place said they would get it and the cost would be $10.00. I was ELATED as I really needed this piece. I waited for weeks and then called to inquire what was the hold up. The nicest guy called me back and said that he was looking into it. He said that they were waiting on the manufacturer to send it to them and they had no idea when to expect it. He called me three more times days and days apart to keep me in the loop. I thought...wow these people are great! I don't have my part yet but at least they haven't forgotten about me. Then I finally receive my part only to see they added almost $82.00 for SHIPPING!!! Unbelievable. 82 bucks to ship a 10.00 item??? I was robbed!
3,1,"They wont return a phone call.I called them with a problem that I had with someone in service stealing my brand new spare and putting old split tire under my rig,it wasn't even the same rim.But wont even return my phone call.Im going to better business bureau as soon as I get back into town.PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,1,"Let me start by saying that from the get go everything went wrong.  The sales guy was frantic and rude. During the purchase he just got up and left the property.  After i went ahead and purchased the trailer there was nobody there to explain the ""how to"" aspect.  We brought it home and did not use it until the past weekend.  That is when I found a bunch of things that were hidden from me during the purchase. Canvas was ripped is several places, radio didn't work. Lights, fan and anything on the upper level did not work. I WAS SOLD A LEMON!!!! Be aware before you purchase a trailer from this company."
3,1,"If I could give less than a ZERO star review I would. I am acting advocate for my parents, seniors in their 70's & snowbirds. They purchased their 2018 Jayco Eagle in Dec 2017 in Quartzsite & the sales person was amazing, however, when it came time to address punch list items for warranty, my parents, who snowbird in a 55+ RV Community in San Tan Valley, took it to the recommended dealership, Worldwide RV, in Mesa for service. What a GIANT MISTAKE! Bill Hanna & Leslie Fisher were verbally abusive & it was the nightmare customer service & warranty experience you fear of when making any sizeable purchase. Bill actually told my father to F-off & hung up on him on the phone. We were told he was fired, but it was a lie. The next time my dad went to the service dept he was surprised to see Bill & asked, ""I thought you were fired?"" His snarky response was laughter followed by, ""Yeah, I hired myself back."" Bill was forced to apologize as his punishment. The warranty work that was completed on my parents' trailer was pathetic & they actually caused additional damage on the interior, caused body damage on the exterior & workmanship was exceptionally poor & needs to be redone. When my parents picked up the trailer, Bill just parked it in front & said it was ready to go, never offering a walk through. My mother insisted & was disgusted to find not all the punch list items were completed, found the additional damage & saw the poor workmanship. Bill's response was basically a shoulder shrug & laughter. My parents contacted the Jayco manufacturer direct & they insisted the dealership make it right & my parents give them the opportunity to do so. Parts were supposed to have been ordered, but Bill came back in July (months after they had the trailer in their possession & the written punch list) & stated he needed pictures of all the issues to present to Jayco for warranty (which they should have taken while they had the trailer for 4 days initially), instead, I had to go out to my parents trailer in 110+ degree weather & crawl around to get all the photos they had to have in order to order parts. Bill said it would take 2-3 days to put the order together. My parents chose to wait until Fall 2018 when they returned so they could enjoy the remainder of the month they had before heading back to WA for Summer. My mom called Bill for follow ups & after the receptionist asked who was calling, was always conveniently in meetings & NEVER returned phone calls. Fast forward to my parents return to AZ 11/2/18, where my mother called Bill & left yet another message with the receptionist, informing them they were back in town (again he was in a meeting!) & ready to schedule the repairs. No call back again. I went with my mom to the dealership on Mon 11/5/18, we asked Bill if the parts he was supposed to order were in, he skirted the question & put the owness back on my parents as if it was their fault, acted like he had no idea who my mother was, said their 1st availability would be late November. I informed him that was not acceptable & he said take it or leave it, started walking away & told me to F-OFF! We went in today, 11/7/18 & met with the Owner/General Manager, David Skogebo. When I attempted to tell him Bill not only told my father to F-Off this Spring, he began talking over me & told us this issue isn't necessary to continue to bring up because Bill apologized. I literally had to tell him to stop talking & listen to me because Bill clearly didn't learn his lesson because he told me to F-Off too. I requested Bill be fired for gross misconduct, in which, he snickered, asked for my name finally & said ""you won't consider this resolved unless I fire Bill?"" in which I replied No, that's not all I'm asking for, I want to come to a resolution so my parents can live in their trailer again. His response was, ""well, this is a first, I've never had a customer request I fire an employee."" Based on other reviews I have a hard time believing this. We know we aren't the only ones who have had similar experiences. When David called this afternoon to update us on his research of our issues he said ""you are one person & there are 50 others that think Bill hung the moon."" I cannot fathom, in my Sales, HR & Customer Service experience over the span of my career, anyone would support or condone telling their customers to F-Off. This is grounds for immediate termination. Leslie is also extremely unprofessional, she got nasty too, telling my dad, ""You're always whining about something!"" This really comes down to CUSTOMER SERVICE & we are in fear now the workmanship will suffer & add'l damage will be caused. How can we trust the workmanship if the customer service severely lacks? I urge you not to purchase or have your RV serviced at this dealership, Worldwide RV located at 4660 E Main St, Mesa. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
3,1,"I am not one to normally post on these sites however this was unthinkable.  My recommendation is to stay away from the service department.  The sales department was great.  I will never take our RV here again!  The lady in service was rude, mean and unprofessional. They had it for 2 weeks and according to her, could not figure out the problem.   She never returned our calls and on the last phone call when we finally got a hold of her she yelled and told us to come pick up our piece of shit RV and she would leave it on the street. Seriously!!! Needless to say we picked it up and took it to another RV Service Department and in one hour had it diagnosed.  Sorry to say this is the poorest customer service department I have ever encountered."
3,1,"We should have known this was too good to be true.  We had to wait two hours for our walkthrough.  The walkthrough really wasn't that great.  I had to watch You Tube to figure out the leveling system.  They were fixing defects on the morning we went to pick up the unit.  We only camped 4 days and documented 43 more defects.  One of which was the grey water isolation valve for the shower tank failing to close.  I got a bath outside the camper when I went to dump for the first time.  The following week we saw the owner, he said these defects were cosmetic.  It took them over 2 months to fix our 'cosmetic' issues.  Another cosmetic defect was daylight coming from the top of the refrigerator due to the molding buckling.  I tried to enlist the aid of Joe from ABC 15, and the BBB.  The BBB even went onto say that World Wide RV is one of their AA rated businesses.  Basically, they both said that as long as the dealer is 'fixing' the issues we don't have a case.  I also feel like Mark F, I was sold a lemon.  All  I can say is be smarter than me and drive past World Wide RV.  Or to quote the mom of a famous movie hero, ""Run Forrest Run !!!"""
4.5,5,"Bruce and the team are great people to deal with they will go the extra mile to make you happy. I do a lot of business here and will always continue. Take the time and drive over as see what Bruce can do for you in all your truck, trailer, trailer part needs, and service."
4.5,5,The owner and his staff delivered top notch customer service. Had to make several calls and even needed to exchange trailers to fit our garage and each time were treated great.  They've been in business over 40 years. Do yourself a favor call or come here first when you are looking for a trailer they will take great care of you.
4.5,5,I purchased an Aluma Trailer from these folks.  Excellent service and fantastic product.   I needed replacement parts for my Snugtop truck topper.  Ryan was soooo very helpful giving me instructions on how to install the window track guide.  Thank you!!!!!!!  I highly recommend Hitchin' Post Trailer Sales.
4.5,5,"We have done business with this company for the last few years & highly recommend them to anyone that is in the market for any cargo trailers, car trailers, motorcycle trailers & more...    Bruce has bent over backwards for us & stands behind his word.  His competitive prices have gained our business back once again.    Thanks Hitchen' Post for coming through again.   We always appreciate doing business with u."
4.5,5,"I just got hitched at the Hitchin' Post... I bought an 8.5'x20'x7' enclosed Look trailer, and I gotta say for the price I came up big time. Big Thanks to Shane and Bruce for making my purchase hassle free. If anyone you know is in the market for an upscale trailer at an affordable price hit 'em up, they'll take care of you."
4.5,5,"Well I needed a snug top for my Chevy Silverado and didn't know where to go! So I was told about the Hitchin Post. I figured I would give it a try. I went down and began a process that was friendly, and been in business for over 40 years! I was able to get exactly what I wanted for my truck! When the top was being installed I felt the people knew exactly what they were doing and made sure to let me know step by step! When my truck came around the corner from the area where they install the snug tops and camper shells I could hardly believe how beautiful the snug top fit with my truck! I am very pleased with the snug top I bought from the Hitchin post along with the installation of the snug top! I will, and have already recommended The Hitchin Post to some people that were lokking for either a snug top, or camper shell for their open bed truck. Come to find out that the Hitchin Post also is in the business of supplying other things as well for a truck, off road vehicles, and vehicles you can use out on a ranch, or pure outdoor living! You been in business for over 40 years you got to be doing something right, is what I say to Bruce who is the owner. I also say once again, thanks!!!"
4.5,1,"I went in to buy a horse trailer. Filthy, cluttered reception area. Too much junk around to reach the brochures.  Mgr Bruce was berating some sad looking employees. He was knowledgable and civil while showing me a trailer. I was ready to buy and asked him ""What can you do for me if I buy today?""  He got real short and said, ""This is the sale price. If you want it, buy it. If you don't want it, don't buy it. I DON'T CARE."" I was still somehow willing to buy and said, ""OK, will you deliver to Henderson?"".  He said ""NO, absolutely no."" I called up the dealer in Hurricane, UT: free delivery to Henderson and $1000 cheaper for similar item."" Hitchin Post missed an easy sale by doing business in a filthy office and being rude. What salesperson says ""I don't care"" ?"
1,1,"These folks don't understand the term ""unsolicited services."" When I post an ad on craigslist do NOT offer me a service. I don't want your service. I did not ask for help selling my vehicle. I want a buyer. Unless you have a specific buyer in mind don't call me! Thank you!"
1,1,Seller Networks contacted ME about selling my car. When I would not give a phone number right off the bat the man berated me and yelled that if I would not give him a phone number than I would never pay to help him sell my truck. Asshole!
1,1,Scamming company. Say a lot good stuff but never deliver. They don't even know I'm their costumer and are still calling me to set up an account with them.
1,1,"I signed up with this company in Oct. Of 2016 i have recieved a handful of leads and they tell you we only pass along people who actually could buy your truck....very untrun i had a lead of a person wanting to trade which I specified no. I had another person that recongnozed the truck and wanted to just tell me that. I had another lead of someone that just wanted to tell me how.nice my truck was and last I had a guy that put in 3 or 4 leads same name and he even said he didnt have the money. They do not screen anything, that is a load of..... I regret signing up with this company bc it was clearly a waste of money. Ive had more viable leads through autotrader classic and craigslist on my own."
1,1,"Going on a year and a half now and absolutely NOTHING!!   I feel like this company stole my money.  I wish I had never answered their calls!!  Funny how when they want you to use them they call you all the time, but once they get their money they do nothing to help you sell.  NOTHING!!!!  
I am sooo pissed off."
1,1,"This place is a scam. The lady told me if my car was not sold in the time period of 30 days that I'd get my $149 back. This was in February. My car was never sold, so I ended up calling back in April which was two weeks ago. They told me they keep the money which that was not the agreement. I was told that the manager would be busy and I'd get a call back. That I'd get scheduled to go over my situation. I asked if all calls are recorded because I was told I'd get my money back that was the only thing that convinced me to actually do it, they said yeah they are recorded. It is now April 17th. I've never heard back from them..."
1,1,Yes they are pushy and I will not fall prey to their services. Thank you all for the sincere reviews and hope you sell.
1,1,"Zero stars! Worst service EVER! Runs closely to a scam. They take your money and disappear, when you call them they never let you talk to your original person and tell you the manager , which they can't give you a name or number for, will call you sometime. The reviews are spot on, what a joke! Stay away!!!!!!"
1,1,"i too, paid and posted in january... we are almost in may and i have not had one inquiry. sellers network is a total scam!!! i would give a zero if it would allow me to."
1,1,"These people made me think that they would sell my Harley in a short amount of time, after many phone calls to me and convincing me they were the best way to sell.  Supposedly posted my Harley on  20 different  websites, but I am only able to see it on 5 of those 20.  Very suspicious and after 3 months of lowering my price, still not sold.  The only reason we are selling is because I have medical issues and need the money to pay for my tests and surgeries.  So here I am suffering and not able to pay for my tests, because of the lies.  Oh, and haven't heard from them or have any hits in over 2 months.  I am very disappointed and hope that no one else gets conned like I did.  I love how guys do this to women...NOT.  :("
1,1,If I could give zero stars I would. It's been over a year and absolutely nothing!!
1,1,"If I could give this company a BIG FAT ZERO I would. My complaint is pretty much the same as Mar C.and Roger E. This company find individuals mostly on free sites like Craigslist who are selling their vehicles on their own. They then gather your contact number and FLAT OUT LIE TO YOU OVER THE PHONE. They suggest what price they can sell your vehicle for, promised when they can sell (3 weeks was when I was told), there is a refund if they don't sell, stated they even offer financing....Sounds good right? Total SCAM.... The individuals working for this company are nothing but a bunch of leeches and scam artists. They use deceptive practices and misleading information to get customers to send over photos of the vehicles for sale. By the time you discovered you have been scammed is weeks later when you do not get a SINGLE request/lead to see your vehicle. Then they have the nerves to list on their website that refund is given within 24 hours if you sell the vehicle privately. There is no mentioned of this during the telephone conversation. They also offer a 100% money back guarantee if the vehicle does not sell on their website...but the somehow ""FORGOT"" to include a timeline such as 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. Good luck if your vehicle gets SOLD IN 10 YEARS."
1,1,"SellerNetworks contacted me about them selling my enclosed trailer.  I happen to know what new trailers (like mine) are selling for and I had mine priced under what a new trailer sells for.  SellerNetworks told me that my trailer would be competitively priced at (and they gave me a much inflated price) and asked me to sign up with them.  This is a bait and switch. They wanted me to be excited about the great price they were going to sell my trailer for.  But, I know, there is no freakin way my trailer is going to sell for their inflated price.  This price was bait to get me to sign up with them."
1,1,I hope that my reviews save others from wasting their money. This company is a scam and should be shut down before they rip off too many people. They hassle and sell you upfront and then they're extremely hard to contact and if you reach someone they're not helpful. They'll inflate the value of your vehicle by 10-15% to promise to get more money than you can....it won't happen. Don't do it. The BBB should shut this company down. Avoid them and save your money.
1,1,"Do not waste your time with this company or any other the company which they use as names like---ClassicCarSellerNetwook,CycleSellerNetwork,Tradeco Media Group,  RvSellerNetwork,BoatSellerNetwork, Certified Auto Network, EquipmentSellerNetwork, and probable many other scam websites."
1,1,"Upon receiving numerous phone calls from these people, I finally agreed to sign up with their service to help me sell my vehicle. However, I greatly regret spending $299.00 for their awful service. I ended up selling my vehicle on my own through Craiglist without any issues. All I received from Sellers Network was a huge hole in my pocket and terrible customer service from the reps who work with Sellers Network. They don't try to help you at all. I've even had to reduce the price of my vehicle numerous times thinking that would help sell it. I don't get any notifications from them, EVER, and whenever I call they give me attitude and I am left still feeling unsure about their service. They also will not refund me my money, even though they did nothing for me. Don't sign up with them, block their number. DON'T PAY FOR THIS SCAM."
1,1,"What an abysmal way of doing business. I work in sales at a car dealership.  They called our main number and hung up before anyone could answer.  When I called back the number on the caller ID, the woman on the other end did not even know what business they were calling or what vehicle they were calling about.  This company should not be in business ant the ""employees"" there are unemployable by any reputable business."
1,1,This service is a scam do not get sucked into listing your vehicle. They will promise guaranteed leads and advertising throughout the country.  I did not receive a single inquiry or call from any of the websites. Don't bother talking to Jasmine the manager because her customer service is beyond horrible- unwilling to help.  Do not sign up if you are trying to sell a vehicle.
1,1,This sellers network will approach you when you have your vehicle posted online. Do not fall  into the trap! It might sound all good when they are trying to sell you the package and make false promises. Have gotten the car posted with them since May 2017 and nothing has happened since then from them!!!!! They will promise you that 300 dollars of yours will make your vehicle being posted with them worth it with financing options. You are better off trying other means!
1,1,Seller Networks is good at selling you the dream of making more money on your sale.  Then you realize that they are only trying to make a quick buck off the fake advertising they provide. Nobody will buy your vehicle with them!  Totally deceiving sales pitch..
1,1,"As others noted below - Seller Networks has terrible business practices. I've received many calls from them - forced to block their phone numbers; their reps are clueless, rude and disrespectful, I will never do business with them and don't recommend you waste your money on them either."
1,1,"Seller Networks is a total Scam.
I listed my car through them on March 8th. They asked to list about $2000 above the private party price. 
I never got a call from any party ever through seller networks so I called them few times and asked them why I am not getting any calls. 
And always their response was, ""We screen the buyers but none has passed their screening"". 
Then I asked them to provide me a list of buyers or count of how many have come through that they have screened and they said they dont keep that info. 
So it smells of total scam. 

PLEASE DON'T BE FOOLED by THEM. PREFER TO LIST THRU CRAIGSLIST, FACEBOOK or LETGO, etc. 

I wasted $300 but you can stay away from them."
1,1,"It has been over a year, no phone call from anyone about the car that The Seller Networks posted FOR ME, no phone call from The Seller Networks to update or check up on their customer, they made a lot of empty promises, especially their MANAGER! 

BEWARE, they got your $300 regardless while you have to sit and wait for other people to contact you (never in my case) so it's a win/win situation for them, not unlucky people like us. 

IT IS A SCAM, ONCE THEY GOT YOUR MONEY, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU!!!

DON'T FALL FOR THIS PIECE OF SHITZ!!!"
1,1,"Why did I listen to this guy's BS? Please listen to me...Do not give these guys any money! It's a complete SCAM!

I spoke with a guy named Shannon who told me everything I wanted to hear, and promised me the moon & the stars. Well, I should've checked Yelp first. I can't believe I got so suckered. I have an amazing car to sell  (2015 Audi A3 convertible with only 10,000 miles, if anyone is interested :) and I thought that these guys were professionals and they could do a better job than me. I posted on craigslist and got about 10-15 calls. I signed up with these guys and got ZERO. I mean, not 1 lead, not 1 call...nothing. I wrote to them several times asking for a refund...and nothing!

I was told there is a huge market for my car and it would most likely sell in under 2 weeks. I was given a suggested price and I was told that my car was a sure sell because of the low miles and perfect condition. Shannon was so positive that I would benefit from his services, but failed to mention that they post on the most obscure and unrelated sites and don't bother with the main ones like autotrader!

I feel like this has been a scam right from the start. I still have my car, and have had to extend my lease 3 times! 3 months later and still, not 1 lead, not 1 call, not 1 message!

Next, I'm filing a complaint with the BBB. I suggest you do the same. Don't let these people continue to scam innocent people."
1,1,"This is a complete joke. They told me during sign up that car will be sold in 1-3 weeks as there is major demand... Not a single inquiry and only solution is to drop prices more and more. Waited now for 2 months and customer service is extremely rude...

Stay away ..."
1,1,"This company AKA Classified Advertising Ventures, is a total ripoff.  I was screwed just like everyone else.  Paid $299 and nothing happened except my credit card was charged.  I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  It is what I recommend everyone else do as well.  Eventually the low BBB Rating will help take these predators out of business."
1,1,"It's useless, just save the money and do it yourself. They only post to sites that nobody visits--no big name sites at all. I received zero interest from the surrounding area and eventually sold the car myself on craigslist (a site they won't manage for you ) after struggling for about 3 months."
1,1,"TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!  They scammed me and are scamming others.  When I disputed with my CC company the company sends canned documentation back to the CC company claiming they fullfilled their service.  The service ""does not specify timeframe of success"" so they have no responsibility to perform.  When I asked for a refund they said no the day after.  This is a total internet scam.  I have had my car listed for 3 months with them and not one call on the car.  It is an Audi A7 2013 priced lower then any on auto trader so it is not for lack of pricing or effort either.  Their sites are fake or no-name sites.  They lead you to believe they will list on auto trader, eBay, you-tube, cars.com but they do not.  STAY AWAY."
1,1,"I was called by Seller Networks at 7pm. I didn't answer and they didn't leave a message, so they called again 40 minutes later. I picked up because it was the same number twice and in an area code that is near where I live. They were friendly and gave me their pitch, saying that they would sell my car for me. When I got the company name, I googled it and came to the bbb website, where I saw many negative reviews and complaints. When I mentioned this to them, their response was ""well we can't be that bad because we have a ""b"" rating"" and then hung up on me. I was genuinely curious about the negative ratings and was open to them giving me an explanation for it, but instead they hung up on me. Very unprofessional."
1,1,"This so called service is a JOKE. They are great at one thing, getting you to sign up and taking your money! I wish I had done more research on this company prior to falling into a hole of horrible communications, RUDE people when you inquire on anything and deceitful advertising. We didn't receive one inquiry on our truck (they will say that they only contact you when they have a serious interest) LOL RIGHT.
 Not only that they pulled our AD off of ebay without letting us know! We sold our vehicle on our own using a $5.00 sign. 
AWFUL ""set up"""
1,1,Thank you all for saving me some money.  I am sorry you were taken.  Karma will get them.
1,1,i was sent a generic text message and called to see who they were. shortly after they asnwered i was greeted by an aggressive sales lady who wanted to start taking my information right away. i asked for more information about the company (because i never heard of it) but she was insistent on just taking my info
1,1,ive had my car up for a month and i havent received one single phone call through seller networks THIS BUSINESS IS A SCAM
1,1,These people are scammers who prey on people trying to sell their vehicle online. They are incredibly rude and have no idea what they are actually peddling. Stay far away from these crooks.
1,1,"Pressure sale. Sleazy, rude and inappropriate selling tactics. Waste of time and money"
1,1,These jokers will try and charge you $300 to list your car on multiple websites.   if they were legit then they would just take their $300 out of the sale price when your cars sells.    But they won't because they don't care if it sells or not once they have got paid.   They call you when they see you car listed for sale online and tell you that they can sell if for more.   Total BS stay away!
1,1,"*********CONSUMER FRAUD ALERT***********Received a call in violation of the TCPA. I did not ask them to call me nor authorize them to call me.  They are skimming craigslist ads and call people randomly, pretending to be customers, then they switch the call into a sales call to pay them $299.00 to ""help you sell"" your car.   This is a violation of Federal Law (Telephone Consumer Protection Act) and also constitutes unfair/deceptive business practices.   If anyone else received any such calls, feel free to contact me.  I will be gathering names and asking a class-action law firm to file a lawsuit against the owners.  
 ************FRAUD ALERT************"
1,1,"What a worthless company.  I have never received any inquiries, questions, calls from anyone concerning the purchase of my Montana Trailer.  Pay them $300 and nothing.

1,1,"After 6 months with no activity on our vehicle, I requested a refund.  As they have done on a previous review.  The representive Jennifer promised to refund half.  3 weeks later, nothing.  STAY AWAY!!"
1,1,"Do not use this company unless you want to spend over $300 on hopes and promises. We were guaranteed our car would sell within 30 days.

When we started with the company, they stated that advertising links would be updated weekly, the last time they were updated was 8/22/18. When I questioned them, Denzel was condescending and rude. Scam! Run!"
1,1,"Just got a call from these guys regarding my Ducati for sale on Cycle Trader. Just listening to them on the phone makes it clear this is a total scam... they read their sales pitch off of a script and know nothing about prices other than your typical wholesale values that are readily available online. Both people I spoke to were extremely rude as well. You also have to pay them up front which is total BS... if you were really sure about your sales model you would have your customer pay when the vehicle sells! Thankfully, the only thing I wasted on these guys was 5 minutes on the phone."
1,1,I posted an add on Craigslist and specifically marked the box that said NO SOLICITING to this add. and low and behold this company calls me every damn time. their tactics are unethical and rude. basically just because of this business practice. I personally will never use this company and I will advise all people I know not to either. They are rude and start raising their tone and temper at you when you simply say something as simple as I am not interested please take my # off your list. this type of activity is completely unacceptable. and obviously reading the reviews they do it all the time. this company should be prosecuted.
1,1,"My car has been listed on Seller Networks since Aug 2017. I was contacted by their sales people from a Craiglist ad I posted and I had checked the box that I didn't want any commercial contacts. I was pitched that they could sell my car for about $2000 more than the KBB price and it would be listed on 20 common websites selling cars including Autotrader and EBAY motors. I have not received one contact from anyone that saw the car on any site other than the Craiglist Ad. Curious why not I went searching on 7 of the most common auto sales websites, several  of which Sellers Network claims to use  and I could not even find my own car listing. My car had low mileage( 40k under average), clean title and carfax and if their network did as it said it should have sold. Do not do business with Seller Networks, in my opinion they are just a scam. Other business names they use, as listed on the BBB site;
Alternate Business Names

After a couple phone calls and waiting all morning for Jasmine to call I finally got a call back and they agreed to a 50%  refund within 10 Business days. If I do not get a refund  consider this a 1 star review.

Update. Network Sellers called back and said they can't refund the money because the credit card company took the 299 bucks back. Called CC company and they said that is not correct, they still have the 299 bucks. They lied again."
1,1,"Do not use this company, horrible people with horrible attitudes!

They cold called me, the lady was extremely rude, when I said no thank you, I am not interested, she raised her voice, talked over me and would not let me talk. I asked for her manager and she said that is not a relevant question and hung up on me.

I called back and asked for a manager, the manager was very short and rude to me as well.

This is a terrible shame that they this company can even be in business."
1,1,"6 months now and no hits, nothing!!  I hope no one else gets suckered into this company's bullshit!!  I am sooooo fed up!!  Paid $200 (that I could not afford) for NOTHING!!!   I am not lowering the price of my motorcycle anymore!  I hope they go out of business!  Very angry customer!!"
1,1,"There really should be a negative indicator as Seller Networks does not even deserve a one star rating.  
I wish I didn't even take the call - a super shady and long drawn out high-pressure sales pitch is all it was.  I ended up selling my vehicle just fine and very quickly and even removed all craigslist ads immediately, but they just keep on calling me several times a day.  I asked the rep to stop calling me since it's not even for sale anymore and she just got a major attitude and said someone will call me again later then - now that just seems like harassment!  Do yourself a favor and stay away - this is a scam and a major headache.  
What a crappy company."
1,1,Seller Networks for cars is a Scam.  Biggest ripoff going.  Don't let them BS you because all they do is lie. Worst customer service
1,1,"Seller Networks,
The moment you post a vehicle online, be it a car or a motorcycle, on Craigslist or some other online method to sell something. These folks will contact you. They offer you an opportunity to use their service and guarantee that they will sell your item by advertising it on several different websites for $300. You do all of the work. You take pictures, develop a video, and give a brief description of what it is you're trying to sell. And, true to their word they post the item on several websites for you. I have had my motorcycle posted for nearly three months now. Steadily lowering the price of it to try and get at least an offer. I have heard nothing. I never hear anything from Seller Networks unless I contact them. THIS IS A TOTAL RIPOFF!!! I threw my hard earned $300 away. Beware, as soon as these people contact you turn them down and tell them to never contact you again. They are very pushy in their tactics to get you to pay for the service. Just hang up the phone and block the number. They will call again and again. That is how they got me. I finally just gave in because I thought I didn't have anything to lose and they would get the bike sold. It's a lie. The bike is still sitting in my garage and I'm out of my money. You're better off just advertising in your local newspaper."
1,1,"I'm not a customer. But, I was solicited by this joke of a company. This review is a bit of a test. I told them I read the Yelp reviews while we were on the phone. They completely tried to discredit Yelp by saying it is for restaurants. My business is on Yelp and we are not food service. These reviews are important and should not be discounted. 

They told me they would sell my car for my asking price and find the buyers. They publish classified ads and websites. Do not waste your money on this service. Can't seem to find even a decent review anywhere."
1,3,"I'm upgrading Seller's Networks from 1 star to 3. They have recently contacted me and agreed to refund half of my money as well as continue to run the adds for my motorcycle. I will say that the bike still has not sold but it was a fair effort on their part to make things right. So, going forward I would say they are not all bad, maybe I am just having some bad luck."
1,1,"They called to try to sell me on their service to help sell my vehicle.  The caller asked a few questions to qualify the vehicle was good enough for their services.  I was then transferred to a sales person or closer. $299 paid up front without any refund if I sell it on my own.  I only had the car listed on craigsist, which they seemed to know.  They knew I tried to sell it a few months ago for more money even though I didn't post the VIN.  Interesting they keep records even though they didn't call me last time.  The closer told me I would never sell it on craigslist and I needed their help.  I shared the overwhelmingly negative reviews on yelp, which they dismissed.  I declined which resulted in an unhappy closer. I then sold it the same day.  Do not use these people."
1,1,"This company is a total scam. They use manipulative tactics to get you to pay the $300. One such tactic, about which I have read on other websites is to suggest they can sell your car for more than you expect. 

Overall, this is a total scam and one would do best to avoid their services."
3.5,5,"We have had two wonderful experiences with this shop. The first time was doing the walk through on our new used rig. Shawn took as much time as we needed to explain everything about the RV. It was easily two hours. Our second trip was for service on our RV - oil change for the rig and generator. Since we live about an hour away, we made an appointment a couple weeks in advance, dropped it off on Monday after regular hours and it was done Tues for less $$ than quoted. They stayed after to accommodate our late arrival. Once again Shawn took the time to explain everything he fixed and recommendations for next time. We are very happy and will be back. Fast, efficient service even though they are moving locations soon."
3.5,1,"We placed our RV with Above and Beyond for several repairs, that necessitated us to go back several times before it could be fixed. They replaced our backup camera three times, each time we had to pay for it over again, the camera kept going out. 
We took it back 4 times to find out why it was drawing power, the said the batteries, we replaced them, still a draw on batteries, then they said, it was a unit in the refrigerator, we replace that part, again still drawing power and then they said it was a power converter, we replace it then, still we had the same problem. They finally said that the battery again needed to be replaced, we so we replaced it again.
This last time we took it in for the camera replacement, they put a dent in the left rear panel, when we asked them about it, they denied doing it. They have a lot of RV's and park them close. We had no dent in that panel when we dropped it off. We part in a RV lot that we do not have to back out of or into, and there was no movement on the RV parked beside us. Their denying that
they backed it into something, was the last straw! We've only had this RV 7 1/2 months and most of the time it has been in their shop for repeat fixes.
I do not recommend their services! I have recently heard from other RV centers, that they get a lot of complaints about this business. We used them because, their parent company owns a sales lot.
I will not be going back and have found a more reliable shop. Do your homework first before taking your RV in for repairs."
3.5,5,"Above and Beyond RV Repair is a family owned business and full service RV repair shop. We brought our  2013 Newmar Mountainaire to them to upgrading to Lithium batteries. They are the only installer in the area that installs Lithium batteries. We explained other issues, one due to a water leak, and they were able to handle every problem without an issue. Jim and his son Shawn explained every fix and performed them flawlessly. They have a 50 amp hook-up, water, and sewer available and let us stay five extra days as we were awaiting shipment of our batteries.  I would highly recommend their service and we plan to return for any future needs. Their pricing is well below their competition, but their customer service far exceeds expectations."
5,5,"The staff is super nice, polite and friendly.  The facility is very clean and secure.  In the years we have used them have never had a bit of trouble.  They have been extremely helpful with everything from truck rentals, storage space and RV storage.  I would highly recommend Debbie and her staff for everything they do including shipping, copies and faxes.  Check out their UPS store."
5,5,"We needed a storage unit in Goodyear and found this one on Yelp of course! 

I went in this past Friday for a tour and met with Alex. She was very friendly and explained how everything worked. I've never actually rented a storage unit so it was very helpful. 

We had a huge issue a couple days later. On Sunday, they are closed. There's nobody in the office but if you have a unit you are able to access the location via a code. Anyhow, after the ordeal on Sunday when there was no one there, I came in early Monday morning and Debbie, the Manager was there.  I explained to her what happened. She was so helpful. It had been a crazy weekend and both her and my Monday mornings where off to a rocky start. She was one employee short and I had hit my toe on a hard box earlier and for sure was broken and turning dark purple real quick. 

So fighting through the pain and limping, I explained to Debbie what was going on not only did she help me with ALL the issues but she took the time to make sure things went smoothly for the rest of the process. 

Monday mornings are very busy at her location. Clients returning moving trucks, or getting ready for the week to have their unit ready, so it was needless to say that the way she was able to handle my issues on top of other customers coming in was really outstanding. Plus she helps a few of the Penske customers, she definitely deserves Five stars and more. Thanks Debbie!!"
5,5,"My experience was very impressive, Debbie the general manager treated us with respect and professionalism,  she offers they services included they new UPS store. Now we can send and pick up are mails or things in this convenience location.
Thanks  Guys.... good job."
5,5,"Palm Gate RV & Self Storage is the best storage facility I have ever done business with. Great location, great facility, and great staff. Everyone there knows their job and very polite and professional. I have used them for not only storage, but also their UPS store inside. Love the drive in bay, so you can load and unload in the cool climate controlled building. Doesn't matter if it's hot outside or raining you can load and upload with no worries of the environment."
5,5,Wow!  Debbie the manager runs a tight ship. The RV storage is fantastic. It's covered its clean and there is 110v power to keep the batteries charged. There is a place to wash the rig and a sanitized dump area. I love this place. It's a little pricey but they have it going on hence the 5 stars. Using businesses in the area is important to me and Palm Gate RV storage is the place to be. Good job!
3,2,"We had stopped in around 7-8 moths ago.  The staff was rude as could be.  We got put on a waiting list for a all year site.  Also, every time we call and leave a message to follow up on wait list, we never get a call back.  Very unprofessional."
3,1,"Don't be deceived!  Some of the staff are nice, if they have the time! This place gets very busy and the staff then is not very helpful. Also because of the cabin rentals- sometimes we saw sketchy characters were in the campground!  We have stayed here several times and finally have decided the new owners are RUDE. The pricing is WAY TOO HIGH, even for the last part of the season. A MUCH BETTER place to camp with VERY reasonable rates, tons of trees and lots of beautiful acreage including a Cleaner Lake  is WOODSIDE CAMP GROUND in Streetsboro on Frost Road.  The new owners of the Streetsboro KOA are inconsistent and rude at times, they act at first like they care but trust me, these two ladies could care less if your stay is great or not!  When we returned our pass cards this last visit, the staff didn't ask how the stay was and barely took the time to write our name down."
3,3,"Nice grounds, We did the primitive camping. The spots weren't exactly laid out and I don't believe there are enough fire rings/picnic tables for all of the campers they let in. Check-in/out was easy. Showers are typical low pressure/cold for camping. I'd stay again for the price."
3,4,"Very nice setup. Clean showers and bathrooms. Great for RVs. Friendly staff. Easy to navigate. The cabins look cute. Nicely located near restaurants, fuel and shops."
3,5,We stayed here for 2.5 months in between selling our home and hitting the road in our RV.  We loved our time there.  The pool was kept very clean and we loved that it was a salt water pool.  The staff was so nice and accommodating.  We had a couple of requests for our site and they were taken care of in a timely manner.  The store makes their own fudge which is great and the ice cream there is some of the best I've ever had.  The grounds were quiet and peaceful and we always felt safe and sound.  We highly recommend this KOA if you are in the Cleveland/Akron area.
3,4,"Very nice campground, love the giant checkers and all the fishing ponds. Friendly staff. Not fond of the bathrooms though, they very small and seem kinda dingy. I really liked the Hocking Hills KOA bathrooms better. Other than that very happy with my stay here!"
3,4,"1st impression driving into park say nice! 
Most recent stay was 07/10//16 & 07/11/16 (I 'm late in posting my review) . . . We camp in a Little Rig ""Tear Drop"" style RV only 15' long w/o toilet or shower ~ plus we like to eat outdoors using the picnic table and set up our dining canopy for sun and weather protection and thus rely on condition of campgrounds facilities and being nearby our site ~ so our critique is focused in that area.

Park has 2 restroom/shower buildings - PROS and CONS of each. CONS: We camped close to very old outdated  restroom/shower building. While set up unisex style with private separate toilet/sink/shower rooms, all were dismal not cheery looking in need of some TLC w/new fixtures and updating,.Rooms were sized ok, but had poor ventilation and steamed up quickly and no way to escape the air but open the door, then you're exposed. Showers were very small/tight w/little room to move around. Rubber mats helps to absorb the water on the floor - but still wear your clogs. PROS: is the shelves and hooks for your stuff plus a small stool for sitting [all thoughtful convenience necessities for campers] Also the newer shower/restroom building located adjacent to the pool near the entrance of the grounds is very nice   All unisex rooms set up the same way but larger, more modern bright and clean. Nice if some day they tear down old building and replace with copy of newer building as described. 

 We camped at the back end of the campground on the grass and among the trees, which was very nice roomy and quiet. No issues there at all - nice area for big rvs down to tents. Campground layout was good w/pool, good condition gavel interior roads, cabins for rent, permanent and seasonal sites too - all well kept and neat looking. Appearance of grounds get best rating shows management cares.     ,"
3,5,This place was pretty nice and family and dog friendly.  There are many guests that bring their dogs so keeping your dog on a leash is a good idea..  They provide clean bathrooms on one side of their public area and showers on the other.  I was expecting this to look like a portable potty but it was far from it.  They provided nice clean flushable toilets and running water.  We were provided a map of the campsite when we first got there to figure out if we wanted a more primitive camping experience or something not as close to it.  We had a running water faucet at our campsite and they provided a ring for the fire pit which is nice.  Other than that great clean camp ground.
3,4,We stayed at this park for the month of July and thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff is very nice and helpful. We liked that they recycle and that they pick up garbage several times during the day. The pool is very nice and well kept. We were able to have mail and packages delivered to the office here. Very pet friendly.  Sites could be improved with more gravel and perhaps a patio area.
3,1,"Went camping for a friend's birthday. We had a great time at the campgrounds and using the pool during a hot day. Around 9PM the staff came up to our group as we sat in a circle talking. They instructed us that we were being disruptive and had to leave the site.  I was shocked. We had no warning or any indication of breaking rules. We asked for an explanation and they gave none. Totally rude behavior by the staff. Quiet time is at 10PM and it wasn't even 9:30.  Don't go here, they will scam you out of your money and ruin your weekend."
3,3,"The sites are very difficult to find in pitch dark of night.  We were late arrival, as we are at many KOAs across the country.  This was the most difficult to locate our site.  Then even more difficult to find the bathroom.  We walked down a steep dirt slope between two cabins to get to bathroom.  The bathrooms and showers were clean along with the general grounds.  However they lacked simple things that I couldn't give more than 3 stars.  Hooks should be in toilet room to hang towel and such.  Showers are separate from toilets in single room with door, no sink or mirror.  The amount of toilets and showers seemed low for the number of camping sites."
3,4,"Excellent campground, came here for a night this week and it was perfect. 2 lakes for fishing as well as a very large swimming pool. Campground was buzzing with things to do and had an ice cream/sweets shop on site. 

They had private bathrooms (like a toilet in shower in its own room, win!) as well as some solo toilet and showers. The bathroom closer to the front could use some renovations in the showers. There was nearly no water pressure and the showers were dated. Other then that really ideal place to stay, just use the bathrooms towards the back!"
3,1,"Avoid this place at all costs. The people are nasty, lazy, and the place is poorly maintained. The staff don't answer the phone and lie to you about holding spots.  Over all  this was the worst KOA experience we've ever had. The site they placed us on had wasps in the electric box then told us to move after we've already set up. Do not stay here in less you want a whole lot of misery."
3,4,very hard to find in dark spaces close together.luckily a nice lady who was staying here helped us .cable and wifi .beautiful lake .seemed ok for the night.
3,1,"Update on the BEDBUGS IN CABINS story. Still no sign of my money back. KOA HQ is no help. And my in person visit on the day I should have been checking out the  manager owner woman Tanya refused to speak to me.basically the only thing she said to me told me was to leave or she was calling the police if I did not leave. That being told to me upset me and angered me more I think then the BEDBUGS. 

If we could give this place negative start I think we would.....we got there for checkin about a half hour after checkin is granted at about 2:30 for our cabin a reservation was made for at least a week prior. Puking in there was a large RV parked at the gate so you could not see the gate itself really or anyplace labels for checkin/office turnoff number 1. Turnoff two was when we did figure out where we needed to go we see a sign on the door saying like be back soon on the grounds....WTF??? Really turnoff number 2. When we finally are able to check in we find out cabin easy enough, get settled in a bit for our two night stay. The cabin itself was ok enough the bigger mattress we would be using wasn't the cleanest but we tried to understand. Slight turnoff though. Found the showers and toilets right across from our cabin they didn't seem like they would be too bad. Decided we was both tired and would lay down for a nap before getting up to go have a good time at the recommended in the ligature FUN n Stuff. About the time both of us fell asleep we wanted rudely woken up by someone weed-whacking  right up against our cabin....turn off 3....like DO THAT WHEN NOBODY IS CHECKED IN.  Anyways when we got back from our fun time around 10 we find the shower heads to be practically unusable spraying every direction that doesn't help you wash yourself...turnoff 4. Go back to the cabin to lay down for bed and see what's on TV....well we will just call that thing a glorified night light, the thing was tiny and positioned poorly above the door so turnoff 5. We give up on TV and just decide time to sleep.....now this is about the time this place goes to negative start in the worst way....I'm laying there and I get itchy so I itch but it keeps getting worse and I can feel swelling of bites on my leg and arm so I get up turn the  light on and start looking around the bed very closely.... F#¢&ing Bugs! NOT JUST ANY BUGS the kind travelers fear....bedbugs....we freak out, AT this point it's like 12:30AM I call the emergence number and tell the staff member who  answered the situation. This person wasn't bad over the phone but when it was 20 minute of waiting when they was to meet us at our cabin I went to the front office to find two women saying they was having difficulties putting our refund back on the card with two trash bags on the counter they was giving us to put our stuff in. We bag our stuff and shower ourself again and checkout to say the least. At 2:00 in the AM we find ourselves 3 hours from home 45 minute always from our AM destination that brought us up here for the weekend in the first place,   Tired, angry and sleepy not knowing what we should do..... with all our stuff that was even in the cabin tied in trash bags in the car....soooo for sure negative stars ... worst KOA experience we have ever had will NEVER BE BACK!"
3,1,"Left in the middle of the night if I could give a zero I would terrible terrible terrible. For starters the women at the front desk needs a serious attitude adjustment sorry we inconvenienced you to do your job. The showers has big signs printed on them ""Cold Water Only"". After 8 hr day of driving that was the icing on the cake. Left and went to a camp down the street at 10:30 pm and world of difference ! Too bad because KOA's are usually on point."
3,4,"This does seem to be one of the closest campgrounds to Cleveland (we were off to the R&R Hall of Fame), but it was 40 minutes, albeit an easy 40 minutes. 

Nice people, nice campgrounds, good fishing, and clean. Had to ding them one star as the showers in one of the restrooms were out of commission for our Fri-Sat night stay, otherwise, just great!"

3,5,"Cleanest KOA we have ever stayed at. Office staff was wonderful. Pool exceptionally clean. Bathrooms were spotless and looked like they were recently upgraded.  This KOA gets five stars because they recycle, which is a huge bonus for us.  Homemade fudge in the store was a nice added touch."
3,1,"Another poor customer service experience at the Streetsboro KOA.

All had been well until my husband and I were locked out of our cabin. When I went to use the courtesy phone, there was incorrect information on the voicemail. We had no way of contacting anyone, as the after-hours number is not posted. When we were finally able to get back inside, I saw the after-hours number and called it-- with no answer and a voicemail that wasnt set up. I tried calling again to alert them to the situation and was finally met on the other end by a rude employee asking me ""If I knew what it was like to leave my phone in the other room."" (why, yes I do, but I don't have an emergency after-hours phone!)

This is a huge safety issue. I will not be staying at this KOA again."
3.5,2,"Spots to close together 
Internet is spotty at best. If you can get on at all. Other than no internet. It's ok.
Would we stay here again? NO."
3.5,5,"Great RV park. The staff does a great job in maintaining the site. There is never trash or litter and the upkeep of the landscape as well as the areas like the pool, etc..,, are well maintained. They are pet and child friendly. They provide dog waste bags throughout the park and I've never seen dog poo! They have onsite laundry that is reasonable and a very nice grilling area!!"
3.5,3,"Not as impressed with this park as I had hoped to be. The park is clean, close to the freeway, and the office staff are nice. Their website advertises many enticing amenities, but don't expect to have use of these when you move in because they have been paved over to make way for more RV sites. The basket ball court, putting green, dog run, and dog wash have all been removed to cram more people into the park... The majority of residents also appear to be retired, and it would seem this park is going 55+. I don't have any kids, but I would not recommend this park to anyone with a family.

I don't have a problem with the size of the sites but some people do. In the last two days I've seen two rigs crash into another parked RV, and a parking barricade."
3.5,3,"Decent RV Park except for nonfunctional WiFi Tengo Internet which  is $15/week for nothing. Don't bother with that!  Laundry is more than adequate. Sites have some landscape which is nice in Arizona.  All sites have a concrete patio and a picnic table.  Close to shopping, movies, etc.  the airport close by has constant plane noise, but that didn't bother me as much as no internet service."
3.5,3,"We have stayed here many times.  This visit was a bit challenging. Made RSVP a month in advance.  Arrived and was told we were scheduled for tomorrow?  After locating our reservation it was noted it had been typed in wrong.  Weekend management asked us to walk around the park to look for vacate spots? We requested a spot was told we would have to move in the morning because of someone else reservation?  It was a mess.  Next morning the manager took care of our concerns.  We did not have to move.  I was a little miffed that their website states they have a Good Sam 10% discount, only to be told they do not anymore?  They would not honor their own site information which I showed them. Highly recommend they update their site quickly and accurately. 
Over the Easter Holiday office was closed.  2 RVs arrived to find their reservations were not posted and no one to help them.  I recommended them to find an open spot and settle it Monday, which they did.  Seemed very unprofessional of the management knowing they had arriving clients.  
After all this, it has been noted the park has changed owners.  Lots of changes, landscaping, more RV slots, nicer dog area, clean bathrooms, laundry room (many machines were out of order), clean pool and recreation room.  They started a daily activity program also.  
I do recommend this park even if management bumps are being felt.  I'm hopeful in time these bugs would be taken care of."
3.5,1,"This is our 5th stay here (a week to 10-day stay per visit) in 2 years.  Each visit, we had a pre-paid reservation, made months in advance for a specific deluxe site.  Upon arrival on this visit, they inform us that they  gave away our requested/reserved site to a long-term tenant who came in one month ago and wanted our requested site... I made our reservation 4+ months ago!  And, they did not have any compatible sites to offer us in its place! UNACCEPTABLE!!   We require room in our site for our dog- gate fencing, and few sites in this park have the amount of room off-pad for us to set up in, that's why we reserve far in advance!  Park management will not allow the portable dog fencing on the cement pads at each site, even with large padded mats under it, but they allow metal tables and chairs that scratch and chip away on the cement pads... that rule makes absolutely no sense!  So, why would I continue to pay nearly $50 per day for a park that will not guarantee a deluxe-level site as requested, even with advanced reservation?!?  Not any more."
3.5,4,"Very nice park. Clean, friendly, and scenic. Has a nice walking path and large sites."
3.5,5,"I have lived in this park a little over a year and I love it! Since I have lived here, it switched owners. I have not met them, because they are so busy making updates, but Mary in the front office is great! Katie and Eric are always super helpful too. The maintenance crew works their butts off all year long. 
As far as residents, I haven't interacted much with too many, but the ones I have have been your typical friendly travelers. 

I highly recommend staying here, just get your reservations in early!!!"
3.5,5,"We recently stayed at Desert's Edge Rv Village for baseball spring training. The entire place was immaculate and well run. It's a family owned and operated business.
The pull thru RV spots we're oversized and super easy to get in and out of. 
All the bathrooms, laundry, and common areas were immaculately clean and kept up
(that was important to me and my kids).

Desert's Edge Rv Village is centrally located close enough for a quick day trip to Sedona, or go shopping downtown Scottsdale. 
We usually stay during spring training. To catch some games and golf. 
Next year we hope to go to Barret Jackson car auction also. 
We can't wait to come back to Desert's Edge Rv Village. 
Its 5 stars all the way"
3.5,4,"Quiet park, reasonable rates, good amenities, close to the freeway. Big pull through spaces. The employees are friendly. This isn't the nicest neighborhood you've ever been to, and I'd recommend you stay away from the 7-Eleven on Deer Valley Blvd. Lots of small airplanes overhead, all day long - as the airport right down the street has a very active pilot training program. But the park allows kids and dogs (many RV parks here do not). The freeway and airplane noise was not a problem, really. This is Phoenix- all noise carries far in the thin desert air. *** Warning! Be very careful driving in off the street. There is a big dip at the curb. You can see where many RVs have scraped through the asphalt. You could rip your sewer pipe or jacks right off. Be very very careful.! ***"
3.5,4,Nice place for an overnight stay. Especially enjoyed the dog wash. Kids had fun at the playground. Quick stay but met our expectations.
3.5,5,"Great RV park, friendly, clean and lots of amenities."
3.5,4,"Very friendly and accomadating staff.  Wifi was great, some sites have mature trees wich provided excellent shade. It is in an industural area and bordered by an airport and I17 so the noise level is a little high at times.  It was a good experience and would stay here again"
3.5,3,"Park has some good sites, the staff is friendly, but the bathrooms haven't been properly cleaned in nearly 2 months.  There is mold in the showers, people's trash laying in the showers, and hasn't been dusted in ages. 
I like the location, the east side of the park gets little highway noise, and I don't mind the airport noise (lots of WWII era planes fly in and out). 
Pretty nice place, but the bathrooms are really out of hand."
3.5,4,"Stayed here for 3 weeks in March, 2016 to attend some spring training games.  Park is super clean, quiet, and friendly.  Lots of doggies and nice doggie parks. Laundry a tad pricey. Easy drive to shopping and restaurants. We would stay here again"
3.5,5,"This park is meticulously maintained. It's close to the freeway, but very little noise with the surrounding shrubs and noise wall. It has the feel of being out in the desert. It's nice that there is a Walmart within 2 miles that's open 24hours. When it cools down in the late afternoon you can enjoy watching the small airplanes flying into the nearby airport. The noise associated is barely noticeable.  Because it's located in northern Phoenix, you don't get the smog or haze when the wind is still.  The bathrooms are immaculate with adequate water pressure.  They have a good sized laundry facility as well."
3.5,2,We used to stay here constantly UNTIL the new owners. THEY DON'T TAKE CASH! I work a lot of events and my credit cards get tied up with the events and my bank is out of state So depositing money to transfer it is impossible to say the last When your working 14 hour days at events. THEY wouldn't work with us and since i get the site for my husband to have with my 5yr old son to relax it was insane that they instead told us he would have to walk to god knows where to get the money order..the closest place is a 30 minute walk (in the heat with a 5 yrold mind you)... They will NOT BE GETTING MY MONEY ANY LONGER.
3.5,1,"Horrible. The place is ok, but the staff is atrocious. Rude, unfriendly, and unkempt and that's just the start. If I were the owner I'd fire them and pay a dog lay out front. Avoid this place until they find someone to run it with people skills."
3.5,5,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay here! There are so many amenities to take advantage of here! There was a living room, work out room, laundry room, pool & jacuzzi!! What more can u ask for? 
Dogs? U ask? There's a dog run and an area to bath ur dog. Very family friendly! An absolute yes when we come back to AZ from CA! Cheers!!!"
3.5,2,"Hubby and I stayed here one night~ that's all I could stand! They forgot to mention the Noise  included in the  whopping price of $47.00 per night in the description of this park. We had just come from camping in the desert of peace and quiet to this? A Freeway just about next to it and and an Airport!?!  I love hearing planes touch and go for hours. Gee, also the guy revving up his engine and dragging up and down the empty business park streets at 2am was sensational! You are packed in like sardines with no cable? Doesn't get any better than this!  :-(
  They did have a nice dog wash area which we used, laundry facility and pool. The grounds were clean. Older and kept up. People were friendly. We booked this online so buyer beware!  Planes and Freeway noise does not constitute R&R. We will not be going back."
3.5,3,"We stayed here for a month this season. The location is good, but the spots are a little close together and the cable is very basic (mostly junk channels no one watches). The laundry is way overpriced and limited machines available. Four dryers and one out of service the ENTIRE time. Also 2 washers out of service. The pool is nice and there is a community room where you can play pool or watch tv while you wait for laundry. There's a small fitness room in this area as well. My daughter enjoyed the swings and slide and there are designated dog areas. If you stay here beware of airport noise! Overall, it was a decent place to stay and the location made it very easy to get around."
3.5,4,"The Park is well maintained and the office is friendly. I was impressed with how friendly the longer term (monthly) residents and the daily residents were toward each other.  Spaces are a little larger then some in the PHX area.
Park located on the flight path of a small airport and therefore noisy at times.
(No jet noise). Like Dockweiler RV park in El Segundo (end of LAX), you will likely ask ""what airplanes after first hour.  We plan to return"
3.5,3,"Location is close to Mariners Spring Training Complex. The bathrooms are inadequate that are cleaned ONLY 3 times a week. 3 out of 6 Washing machines have been out of order for a week. 

Park is kept clean and is quiet.  Staff is friendly. 

I would like to keep our dog pen on the patio but They are not allowed."
3.5,1,"Tout themselves as ""family friendly"" but that is not the case. The old people rule the park. My 13 year old is not even allowed to take the trash to the dumpster without an adult with her. Do NOT stay here if you have children! Very disappointing!"
3.5,3,"Nice RV Park...second time we've stayed there (Dec 2014, July 2018). Liked it better in the winter. Pulled  in after hours; no power to my site. Had to find an after hours staff. Ended up just moving to another site. Friendly staff."
3.5,3,"The Desert's Edge RV Village is located just north of Phoenix in an industrial area. A good location while visiting Phoenix.
The staff is extremely friendly an nice. There are lots of amenities-heated pool and hot tub, dog park ( walking area), community room with a pool table and games, and a nice laundry room with newer washers and dryers. 
The space provided  is big enough of a for a class C and comes with a picnic table, a small concrete  ""porch"" and a extra parking space. 
The only negative is you are packed in like sardines. There is not any privacy between you and your neighbor."
2,1,Worse service experience. The service man Mike did nothing but lie for 3 months of having our RV to find out in the end that nothing was repaired. He even tried to blame the manufacturer approving and then denying the claim. I followed up with the manufacturer and this was a complete lie. We called several times during the process to make sure our batteries were not just sitting to go bad and when we received the RV back guess what. Batteries were completely dead. We are in the process of making a formal complaint as we have had nothing but issues with them since we bought this RV. Stay clear of all service and purchases with this company.
2,1,After spending hours with a salesman named smokey we finally had a deal. Spent over an hour doing paperwork and tired as hell left thinking we bought a camper. We spent the whole next day shopping for everything we would need. Not cheap. Then a week later we were told that we did not have a deal. They said it was because they forgot to pull one of our credit reports and the score was too low.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing. That couldn't be right so I got out all our paperwork and found they had run both my husbands and my credit reports and they were lying about the score. It wasn't too low. I tried to contact them and they are refusing to answer my questions now. They realized they weren't going to make enough money on the deal so they made up a story to get out of selling the camper to us. Don't buy from this place. They are liars! And the comment below is a sad excuse for an apology and means nothing. They are the worst place you could go. Their sales tactics and empty promises are pathetic. Actions speak louder than words.  We went to Camping World and bought a trailer there instead and it was a great experience and we are much happier now. Don't waste your time with La Mesa's bull.
2,1,"As a perspective employer they have to be the worst around here, I have applied as a driver for them and with many many years of safe cimmercial driving they wouldn't hire me for a part time job of moving RV's because ""I have had to many jobs"" in my opinion they are looking for the perfect old man who is retired and had one career job but the pay for this doesn't warrant that, and I will continue to voice my concerns on pleces like YELP."
2,1,"Don't even consider stepping a foot at any LA Mesa RV.  Consumer beware they sell you  junk.  But their customer service is junk. Your lucky if the service dept every returns your calls. Their corporate office is not any better, no wonder."
2,1,We bought a motorhome from them in October. Still have not gotten the repairs done that they have promised. The worst customer service and service department I have ever experienced. Do not buy from them.
2,1,"My husband and I bought a brand new Dutchmen Aspen Trail from this dealership June 2016, we took it on a short trip right away and we were asked to make a list of anything that needed attention so we did and we returned it for the repairs.  It was there for over a month and the service department did not return phone calls, etc.  A major defect was the awning was not installed properly from the factory and the door bumped into it.  The trailer was there for 2 months!!  We were told the service person did not order parts, wrong parts were ordered and on and on.  We finally got it back and after all the wait, the awning leaks, the thermostat is broken, the LED lights were installed all crooked, the TV wasn't installed properly and our battery was dead.  We are beyond disgusted with the service department at this dealership!!!!!!!!!!!  The only personal who has kept my husband from driving the trailer through the showroom window is Ed.  Honestly I don't want these morons touching my trailer again.  I'm going to share this experience with every review website, through social media, etc until these guys pull their heads out and start providing acceptable customer service!!  I wish we had never bought it!!"
2,2,"Staff was very helpful and worked with us on the sale, only reason for two stars. Pickup on our trailer was cancelled once because they over booked then tried to make us take off work to fit their schedule to pick it up.
Less than a month and had to take in for service, what a joke. They ask if you need help then leave you standing around waiting, I even had an appointment! Have been calling to pick my trailer up, they girls do t give message to service or he just ignores calls and won't call you back. Wish I had known had poor they treat you after the sale."
2,1,"I bought a 2017 Fleetwood unit last October from their RV show. Our sales team was awesome. Price was good and the salesperson was incredibly fair and informative and they were easy to negotiate with. This isn't our first RV and per the norm after a couple shake down cruises we had a small list of items that needed warranty repair. It's now Jan 17th. 5% of the items originally listed within the first 10 days have yet to fixed. Communication with the service department is poor although the service advisor we have is likeable. Calls and emails are not returned in a timely fashion and when I called Fleetwood to check on my parts that are ""on order"" I found that nothing has been authorized with Fleetwood and nothing is on order. Service falls flat on it's face. I want to like this dealership. I want to be able to refer friends here. I just can't. The service end of things is simply terrible. Stories don't add up, communication while friendly means nothing without actions to follow it up. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in the service department. It really has ruined the entire experience for me and it appears as though I'm going to have to drive 6+ hours to Riverside to the nearest REV center to get my warranty repairs done. They'll sell you a coach for sure and at a good price but the moment you drive it off you are nobody anymore."
2,1,"RUN...do not purchase from this vendor. I sure wish I would ha e read reviews prior to us purchasing as 99.9% of the complaints were about extremely POOR service or better yet, lack of service. It's been 1 1/2 years to get a couple of minor things repaired and still not done. We have the emails, which they say we will be contacted. NOT ONE INDIVIDUAL HAS CONTACTED US IN ANY MANNER. We are now hopi g we can transfer to another dealer. If only their service was as good as their sales pitch...not even close! BUYERS BEWARE"
2,1,"I wish I would have read the reviews on yelp before we bought there, lousy lousy service department. It's like they say, you get what you pay for, even if you get the product for thousands cheaper it's not worth dealing with them"
2,1,"My parents are spending the winter in AZ this year, and they were in need of a couple parts. We decided to visit La Mesa RV for some assistance and had a horrible experience. When we pulled in, we were greeted right away, and directed to the parts department. There were approximately 3 employees in the store and more in the hallway by the service counter. We spent a few minutes browsing, and headed to the counter. There was an employee at a desk that didn't acknowledge us. We waited, and waited and waited. We spent about 15-20 minutes waiting. With out a ""hello"", without a ""we'll be with you in a moment"" certainly with out a ""how can we help you"" we left and went to camping world where we were assisted politely and promptly. They are now in the market for a 5th wheel, with La Mesa's rv event coming. I'm disappointed to say this would be the last place we would go for a purchase. If you fail at service you do not deserve our sale."
2,4,"Just took delivery of a new 2018 Fleetwood Discovery. Process went fairly smooth. Doing an out of state delivery is challenging, but required unless you have an extra $10K lying around. The people at La Mesa RV are very nice and work very hard to please you. My unit had a large amount of warranty issues requiring repair before we could take delivery - about a month's worth. Good news is they went through the unit very thoroughly. Living out of state trying to get updates was very challenging. Their service team is very busy, which is fine, but they have no means for customers to know what is going on other than tracking the service rep down over the phone which proves very difficult. The assistant who all calls end up going to appears to have no access to repair status so while she answers the phone she couldn't answer any questions. Due to the number of repairs, I had to change my travels plans for delivery twice - which was difficult when I couldn't get a hold of anyone for a status update. Nevertheless, delivery went smoothly and I'm very happy with the unit."
2,1,"The salesman are well trained and will promise you the moon. The service department and customer service after the sale is the worst that I've ever experienced. You can leave all of the voice mails that you want with the service manager, but don't expect any calls returned. I've been waiting and waiting and waiting over a month now and still no return call.
I bought a new motorhome and some items need warranty work, but no return call to schedule it. I got notice from the manufacturer of a recall and called to schedule it with the LaMesa Phoenix Service Manager. Left a voice mail but again, no return call."
2,1,"Lamesa RV sucks!! Never again. No stars, bought a new Rv, sat there for a month while it had 3 hours work, there's a months warranty shot. And there sales person john screwed us on our trade in. Which we didn't trade in because he bought it!! Screwed us on another 500$ in tax,  thanks!!!"
2,4,Overall a great experience with this dealer.  I contacted them on-line for price on an RV on their site.  They were up front with the cost and all associated charges.  Many dealers won't tell you the price until you sit down to buy and then additional charges are added (like PDI and other charges).  There was no funny business with this dealer from beginning to end.  Well worth the trip from Southern California to purchase from them
2,1,"Do not do service with Me-mo!!! Terrible. Nice enough guy but nice doesn't cut it. Never returns a phone call. Bought a brand new 5th wheel, did the walk through and everything seemed perfect. Had it delivered and within 24 hours the frig stopped working. Memo sent somebody from LA Mesa to fix it and all he did was change a fuse and told us if it blew again put a bigger fuse in next time. Hmm umm ok! I'm not doing that because I am not going to start a fire if electric is pulling from somewhere else. Anyway, guess what it blew. Fridge out again. La mesa messes around and calls back says they overnighted a part and would come change it. Well Friday came and they never came to change it. Monday came and they never came to change it. We called and called Monday and Tuesday and never got a call back from memo. He did call a mobile rv repair company to come out and fix the fridge but that guy at the company said he couldn't fit it into his schedule because he was going on vacation. Called memo back to tell him this and still no return phone call from him or manager. Now it's been almost 2 weeks and no fridge. Threw away hundreds of dollars worth of groceries and meat from the freezer. Living out of a cooler and fast food until this gets fixed. Appears there's no end in sight to this because of the lack of customer service. Really getting frustrating when this is my home and have no fridge and nobody at LA mesa rv seems to care. Receptionist even got snotty and so rude yesterday when I would call. That was not her place to lecture me. I am not happy. Every person at the campgrounds I work at know about this bad service and every patient I care for knows as well. I am surrounded by rv dwellers so word of mouth la mesa is not good for you!!"
2,1,"We went to their show at the Cardinals Stadium, I will never recommend anyone to go to this place. They sales guy was super pushy...and the finance guy was extremely rude. We took our business elsewhere. For dealing with customers I would suggest the change their attitudes or go find a job elsewhere. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone."
2,1,"The finance manager is rude and insulting. Too bad there are so many other places to go. We tried them because they are new. Keep it up, boys. You will be out of business if insulting potential buyers is your definition of great customer care! Good luck. Going elsewhere."
2,1,"They have the worst customer service I have ever seen. Its not just this location. Its COMPANY WIDE!  All the locations.  Its really sad. You send thousands of dollars on an RV and then they treat you like they do.  I have called about an issue for 4 months!!  4 months and they NEVER CALL BACK!  I have to call and call.  I truly hate this place.  If you can find a better place go!  If you think you are getting a great deal on an RV from them, remember this.   You WILL pay dearly when it come to service.  It will cost you in the long run. So think really hard before you drop thousands in this place.  It true about the saying "" you get what you pay for""  cheaper does NOT mean better."
2,1,We purchased a RV at their big sale in February. We were traveling thru AZ so read reviews about LaMesa RV. We have been very disappointed in many ways since our purchase. We were promised our 5th wheel to be ready by 3 p.m. on sighing of final papers. It was not ready until after 5 and when it was it still wasn't fixed properly. It was 5 o'clock on Friday so the entire service department left for the weekend. Now we are trying to get our license plates and it was titled in AZ and we live in SD. We have emailed and called the business department and still no return call. At this point I would never recommend LaMesa RV to anyone. Seems they take you money and then you are not an important customer anymore. A very dissatisfied customer. Vickie G from SD.
2,1,"La Mesa would not help us when our elderly father bought an RV and we needed some information.  They told us to 'get a subpoena"" and this was a General question that anyone with access to paperwork could have answered.  DO NOT do business with this people they are not honest or helpful to their customers."
2,5,"I thought the overall purchase experience was average, and just a transaction. However, working with their service group, specifically Skip Beeswy has been a premium experience. He truly understands the coach, and is extremely responsive. I would not go anywhere else."
2,1,Went to check out a new travel trailer found a model we liked and were severely low balled on our trade. We liked the trailer enough to let them check our credit. Then came the story about their 40 year history started out as father and son and now this store alone sells a thousand coaches a month and how nobody can beat their deals. After their attempt to take our heads off I showed them what I had on paper from a much smaller true family run dealership in Tucson. The deal was met with laughter and how there was no way they could do that deal or get us the interest rate they promised and how we'd be back after our wasted trip to Tucson. It appears he was right about one thing they didn't get us the rate they promised. It was .25% LESS than they promised. Dutchmen and all other manufacturers they sell should pull their franchises. These guys are a disgrace. If this ever was just a father and son start up someone from the family should come into Phoenix and clean house from the finance dept and up. Save Thousands shop else where.
2,1,"We purchased an RV at a show.  They said it would be detailed and fully checked over before we picked it up, it of course had tons of people in it that weekend and there was some damage to a cabinet on the glide.  They said they needed to order a new glide 6-8 weeks.  OK we would pick it up before then and keep track of other issues.  They called when we were on our way to pick it up to say the speakers were not working and they needed to order a new one, did we still want to pick it up?  Yes, we picked up our new trailer and took it out the next weekend.  The water heater didn't work and the face plate on the door lock had come off.  Took it back when the stereo came in.  They replaced the face plate, the stereo and found out that the bypass system was not disabled to the water heater so that's why it didn't work.  This was something that should have been checked the first time.  My husband went to pick it up, he had an appt, but there was no one to help back up to hitch.  There was another customer there and they helped each other.  When he got home the water heater works, but the sound system does not.  CD's keep getting kicked out.  After researching the web we find out there is a screw on the back that needs to be removed after transport/before installation.  Had to remove the stereo from the cabinet and remove the RED TAG that said remove screw before installation.
Also we find out they still haven't ordered the cabinet face, turns out they don't need the whole glide, (go figure) and now it will still be 6 - 8 weeks out.   The service here is very slipshot, the receptionist is very short on the phone and you have to wait hours or never for a return call from you service person.  
Won't be shopping there again next time I want to upgrade."
2,1,"We found the perfect recreational vehicle for us at the RV show. We locked the doors behind us and started talking numbers with our sales guy and a numbers guy. We did the back and forth thing and after an hour and all kinds of different options WRITTEN down, we agreed on a price. 

The numbers guy left and returned with the final paperwork. I immediately realized the final paperwork was $800 MORE than our agreed upon price. I asked to see the handwritten paperwork. He didn't have it. And he wasn't willing to produce it. He claimed the numbers he had on the contract were what we agreed on and I called BS! 

I had a big problem with this situation. The guy claimed the paperwork wasn't available??? Sounds like a Hilary move to me!! Because of my persistence, he finally left and brought the paperwork back and then said ""it was a mistake"" and that he couldn't sell it for the agreed upon price!!

Anyhow, while we were inside the RV with the doors locked, several people were back to take another look, knocking on the doors and windows. Maybe THAT was another one of their tricks!!! I have to admit it worked because we felt a bit pressured that if we walked away someone else was going to grab it!!

We decided to sign on the dotted line because we wanted it, even at the higher price!! I figured I'd contact the corporate office, prove my case (which I did) get a credit, right?? HELL NO!! The manager at corporate simply admitted that it happens all the time and basically, too bad. We signed a contract, agreeing to the price. 

If you shop there, RECORD your experience talking numbers and, if they play tricks on you too, blast it on social media so they put a stop to their crooked practices!!!

So, although we love our RV, we don't like La Mesa, nor do we trust them!!!"
2,1,"I can't say I was very pleased with my recent repair experience with LaMesa RV. I brought our 2012 Winnebago Adventurer in for an oil service and some other needed repairs. After my discussion with the advisor I decided to have them do their 40 point Motorhome Maintenance inspection which included the oil change and a thorough check of all the other systems in the RV. The other repairs needed were as follows:

1. Water heater leak. (Pressure valve replaced.)
2. Rear slideout awning wasn't closing fully. (Spring needed retensioning.)
3. Cosmetic panel on side door needed to be reattached. 
4. Rear lock on the large slideout was not locking. A short in the wiring harness was the cause. (This short circuit was repaired by LaMesa RV in 2013, but failed again.) 
5. Small plastic bracket for sliding bedroom door needed to be replaced.
6. The alarm on the hydraulic leveling jacks would go off for no apparent reason while driving. Cause was low hydraulic fluid. (Needed a seal replaced which caused hydraulic fluid to leak.)

I was told by the advisor at that time that the estimated cost of the 40 Point Inspection and the other repairs I needed would be at least $800 unless other things were found during the inspection requiring more $$. I was asked at the time as to whether I had an extended warranty on the RV and I said no, we don't have an extended warranty. I was asked again before I left that day and responded negatively again. 

The inspection turned up a couple of extra things. The house batteries (2) needed to be replaced at a cost of $350 and the water heater needed a full service and valve replacement at a cost of $216 (parts and labor). The advisor contacted me to let me know about the above and also parts and labor involved in the other repairs. The cost of the parts was negligible and I assumed the cost of the labor was a large portion of the $800 original estimate. At the time I was given no final $$ of the repairs by the advisor. Given the extra cost of the batteries, water heater and other parts, I figured the bill would be approximately as high as $1400 -1500. 

When I was told the RV was ready for pickup, the advisor called and set up an appointment with me to be there at 2:30pm. I arrived at 2:30, but nobody seemed to know where the advisor was. As it turned out the advisor was at lunch and finally showed up 15 minutes late. (I wasn't the only customer waiting for him.) 

The advisor then escorted me over to the cashier so I could look over the bill. The cashier asked me twice if I had an extended warranty while I was looking over the bill. I responded negatively both times again. In the meantime the advisor was arranging for the RV to be brought around. I was totally surprised to see the bill was $1965 which included $1443 for labor alone. Much higher than what I was led to expect in the way of labor $$. 

It took another 30 minutes of waiting before I was ever able to get on the RV to check the work that had been done. Everything on the list had been addressed. The only problem was the small plastic bracket for the bedroom door wasn't properly installed and fell apart when I touched it. Another 20 minutes went by while they attempted to fix the simple plastic bracket. I finally told them to leave it as it was and I'd fix it myself just so I could leave and get on with my life. They did not offer to credit me for the labor $$ on the repair. Their inability to deal with the easiest and simplest fix of the list didn't do much to inspire my confidence in the more important repairs. 

At this time, I wouldn't recommend LaMesa RV for repair services unless you have an extended warranty. Their whole operation for pickup was unorganized and not well handled."
2,3,Thank you to Elliot and Nathan for making what started out as a Very Bad experience end up an OK experience..Appreciate the time and attention both of you guys gave to us and our motor home issue..Renee
2,5,"My uncle just bought a new camper van from another location but stopped in here because something wasn't working right. The service department told him to pull up the van and within minutes the problem was solved. 

We walked inside the showroom and the sales guys were nice. We had a dog and a kid with us which they didn't mind. The best part is they let me use the employee microwave!"
2,5,John went above and beyond. He is a sales person at La Mesa RV. We called on Labor Day and the service department was closed John talked us through our repair. He was considerate and took care of our problem. Rate to find nowadays.
2,1,One of the worst companies i have every purchased something from. Beware everything at the dealership that is new comes AS-IS and the dealership does not stand behind their products or their customers. I purchased a BRAND NEW quarter of a million dollar coach that had a major problem after six days and a ruined vacation. All I received is there is a 1-800 number in your Manuel to get is home. After I got it home they basically gave it a spit shine and said it was like new SHAME ON LA MESA RV... I would give them negative stars if I could. :(
2,2,"We went to this dealer not knowing much about the inventory they had, but because we are in the market and were nearby so we thought we'd see what they carried.

They closed at 6pm this day. We arrived at 4:30pm. We were greeted with ""we like to close up early- most trailers will be locked by now, but I can walk you over there.""

They don't carry lightweight trailers (they have a couple, but they were heavier than what we are in the market for.) Salesman took us over to they few they had and showed us around. I'm warming up to him at this point.

But then, after telling us incorrect weights (I kindly pointed out he was reading the stickers wrong), he proceeds to insult my tow vehicle and choice to get a small trailer. I honestly don't even think he realized how rude he was being--it seemed to just be his personality. I've done my research. I don't appreciate know-it-alls.

Basically because they didn't have what we were shopping for, what we were shopping for was lame to him and he was not afraid to say so!

Based on this experience, I wouldn't recommend. If I'm ever in the market for a larger trailer, I would seek out help somewhere else. This salesman was with the company for 19 years. Based on the other locations poor reviews, and this experience- it's clearly not the company for us."
2,1,"If you are even thinking about an RV - Don't buy it.
There is NO SUCH THING AS CUSTOMER SERVICE AT LA MESA AVONDALE.
SUCKS!!!
Believe me, had I known how this experience was going to be I would NEVER have bought a brand new 2016 anything from these guys. The salesman was fine, but once they had my check it was pure BULLSH*T. Waiting without our vehicle and our plans for Christmas trashed because of their incompetence."
2,3,"After speaking with management at la mesa rv we were able to take our new motorhome back in to have repairs made that were missed during inspection prior to the sale.  Eddy our service advisor took very good care of and made sure that everything was working correctly.  It was unfortunate that to get the exceptional service that was promised when we were at the rv show meant speaking with management, but we are glad in the end it all worked out!"
2,1,"This has been my worst experience in buying an rv. What was described by the sales person as how we would be treated was far from reality. We purchased our rv at a show and anxiously awaited them to do the 102 point inspection and schedule delivery. When the day finally came to pick up the rv and take home our new pride and joy we discovered where the service really stopped.  We checked in at our appointment time and after 20 minutes someone finally came to get us. He informed us that he had just received the rv and had barely time to look it over.  He also told us that because it was late in the day we would need to hurry because service was closing soon. So we did the walk around and expressed our concerns on items, which we were told would be fixed or weren't covered by them. The items on the list to be fixed would be scheduled and taken care of. Then because of the late hour they couldn't fuel our rv, empty the tanks, replace the battery in the smoke detector, replace an electrical switch, give a new rv dump hose, look at a failing leveling jack, and the list continues. This was all to be scheduled.  We were then rushed off to finance.  The people there were amazing at getting things done quickly and one of the only highlights. We finally make it home and it has now been a week and several emails and calls and still no progress on the list of missing repairs. 102 point inspection is a joke. They barely detailed it and pushed us out the door to fend for ourselves. I would not buy from this dealer ever again."
2,1,"DO NOT BUY FROM LA MESA !!!!  There is not enough room on this page to give all details. Started with bait and switch pricing, Now its poor quality product.  Brand new unit, been in the shop for half the time I've owned it and its still not fixed, and more things break every time I use it.  PLEASE LISTEN TO MY WORDS......DO NOT BY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!  I will spend many years regretting my decision not to run away at the first sing of problems.  You have been warned, if you buy from here, don't blame me, I doing all i can to spread the word to anybody that will listen.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!"
2,5,"I would like to thank the employees of La Mesa Rv in Phoenix Arizona. Salesman Micky Hammond was outstanding. He took time out of his busy days to be on site whenever we were there, even came in on his day off, Sales manger Derrick is the best, listened to our needs and made sure they were meet. Thomas Grader is the best service advisor in the state, if it doesn't pass his inspection he has it re-done. Our rv tech Cole did a fantastic job. Doing things for us that was not included in the work order (shhh don't tell anyone) Overall I would give the whole crew A + .. If we purchace another RV you can bet we will be back .. Fantastic job... 

Thank You 
Dennis & Sharon Hulbert"
2,1,"Update: I finally got ahold of a real person on my third try today, after letting it ring for a while. They are all still safe and alive at La Mesa RV. I was legitimately starting to worry! 

The Service Receptionist had service agent call me back and the manager returned my call shortly after that from the voicemail I'd left yesterday. It still blows my mind that toy can't leave a general voicemail for parts or service.

______________________________

This place gets one star because I couldn't leave no stars.  La Mesa RV cares about one thing: selling RVs. Once you are out the door, they prefer never to see you again. 

I don't know why they even have a ""Service"" and ""Parts"" Department option when you call their number, because for 5 days straight, all of my calls have gone unanswered. They also don't have voicemail for either department so I can't even leave a message. The phone just rings. FOREVER.

Interestingly, you can actually contact a real human being by selecting the ""Sales"" department, so this is not a fake business. There are real people that work there, some where. The gal that answered didn't work at the McDowell location though. She transferred me to the manager's voicemail (so they DO have that technology too!) but my message has gone unreturned so far. 

My frustration level is through the roof, clearly. I've reached out on several social media platforms in hopes that my cries for help will be answered. I haven't gone there in person yet because 1. It isn't real close to my house and 2. I question if anyone will actually be there because no one has answered the phone in 5 days. They are all probably at an RV show, trying to sell RVs they will never service. 

If anyone from La Mesa RV is there to read this...all I want to know is if my less than 1 year old battery has a warranty. It won't hold a charge.  

Even if you don't answer my question, please let us know that you are okay!  That you aren't all being held hostage and can't answer the phone...or that you haven't fallen and can't get up!  

It is very rare that I leave a bad review (seriously, check my past reviews.) I prefer to focus on the positive. 

With that said...the sale process was smooth and I feel like we got a decent deal. The gentleman that did our walk though and showed us how everything worked was AWESOME!  Just a Genuinely nice guy. It's sad that someone with so much knowledge and passion for what he does is working at a place like this, that has no regard for its customers. 

Also, when we picked up our camper at their location after purchasing it at RV show we had to wait for them to repair the power cord that plugs into the truck. It had been worn completely thorough to the wire. It wasn't like that at the RV show. They had to tow it back to their lot from the RV show and it blows my mind that someone unhooked it and didn't notice several inches of exposed wire. Or they did and just didn't care.  To send a family off their lot with damage like that is unconscionable. 

We've had several friends buy a new toyhaulers in the 11 months since we purchased ours and we have warned them all to stay away from La Mesa RV. We won't purchase from them again. Even though the sale went well, this is just not the kind of business we want to support."
2,1,"They will tell you what they think you want to hear and when the customer finds an issue Management (James) got upset and tries to bully you. James refer me to Customer Services Management in San Diego Jay Castro who still has NEVER Returned my messages or phone calls. Our problems started in the orientation when we went to pick it up, Johnny was told we changed our mind and nothing was ready (mind you it is over 100 degrees out when he does a fast track orientation) and does not explain everything to us. We are told to leave and fix the issues we found for a week and they were not fixed. We went to pick it up the service guy told us we had to pay for his help to hook it up. They we bring it home and NO ONE told us about the battery breaker or the generator breaker until 3 days later after I had to continue to call.
Our main Problem is we told them what Off Road vehicle we had and they showed a picture that had a 4 seater in the toy hauler that we were purchasing, and that our 2017 4 seater Razor would fit in the toy hauler - We did measure and yes it should but it does NOT, when I tried to get the problem solved no one would help and I finally talked to James and his solution was for us to cut and move the door, sale our Razor or remove patio. Or trade the RV in that we have NEVER Used and they would figure out how much they could give us probably $5 to $10,000 of the price we paid.  Customer Service is so dysfunctional...
I would NOT Recommend this Stress or HELL to anyone...."
2,1,"Where to start?  Know this:  THEY WILL SAY AND DO ANYTHING TO MAKE THE SALE!  We told the sales rep, Alex, that we wanted to order a new coach and take factory delivery.  Magically he found a new RV in the model we wanted on it's way to the Albuquerque store and he said he could have it re-routed to the Phoenix store for us.  We agreed, based on the fact that he insinuated that it was coming from the factory.  We waited a few days for it to arrive and get cleaned up.  We made the deal.  Our walk through was scheduled at 1:00, but didn't start until 4:30, leaving us no time to move our things from our old RV to the new one. We had to be back at the RV park before dark, in February, on a Friday.  The man giving us the walk through stated he had never been in our type of motorhome before...and spent a lot of time just trying to figure out how the remote controlled awnings worked.  

After reviewing the paperwork that night we noticed that the manufacture date was 6 MONTHS prior.  So technically yes, it was new because it had never been sold before, but it had sat around at shows and on the lot for 6 months. When we asked Alex where it had been he would not answer our questions.  He deflected, saying ""I don't know, I haven't been following it around"".  He absolutely knew we did not want a show or floor model.  Rumor has it he was fired for telling a lady that the shower wouldn't seem too small if she lost 60 pounds.  He had the most foul mouth and dropped the f-bomb fluently.

After service was horrible as well.  We had 2 water leaks, which affected a other systems.  They fixed the easy and obvious water leak under the sink in the rear bath.  They did a few of our requested warranty items, but some things were beyond their capabilities and we ended up with a 40 item punch list. They created problems while attempting to fix things.  Our baggage door had to be tied down because it wouldn't stay closed after they ""fixed"" it.  We were promised $100 credit in the store, and induction cookware for the cook top.  It's 7 months later and we just received the cookware- and it's not induction compatible!  Seriously, how hard is it to do a little research to get the right thing ordered?

They still owe us a bedspread.  The one on the bed when we took possession was stained.  We didn't notice until the next day because it was so late and dark when we got the coach.  We're told that the factory didn't send the right bedspread.  7 months people, how long does it take to get a bedspread from the factory?  At this point I don't believe anything they tell me.

We ended up going to the manufacturer in Indiana to get the balance of our warranty work completed.  While there we talked to other couples who had the same experiences with La Mesa RV in the Phoenix area.  2 were from the Phoenix store, 1 was from the Mesa store.

The bottom line is that if you want honest, go somewhere else."
2,5,"We just recently purchased a new class B Roadtrek on the Dodge Promaster chassis. Our sales rep was Alex. We got the exact van we wanted, and we got it for a great price. The van arrived at the dealership without the backup handcrank for the awning. They shipped it to our house as promised. On our first trip we discovered we had 3 water pump leak issues. This was a problem because we had to turn around and make another trip in three weeks in the heart of the holiday season. Even though they were booking service appointments into the end of December, they managed to turn us around in less than two weeks. All the repairs were of course covered under our warranty, and we were not jerked around in the slightest bit. Our service manager was Freddie, and he was amazing and thorough. I also want to say that the service reps really took their time going through all the features of the RV with us thoroughly and patiently. We've seen a lot of bad reviews about all the RV dealerships in town, and I would just say that everyone should be thorough before they go to a dealership and know what they want and understand that there are not a lot of RV repair folks in town so you have to know how to plan for repairs and to advocate for yourself. Read the fine print so you are not caught off guard, and I do believe your experience will be very positive as ours has been. I do like La Mesa RV on McDowell very much and recommend them highly."
2,1,"My husband and I are seeking to purchase a Pleasure Way Ascent RV in 2019. We have done extensive research on this vehicle, including traveling to the large RV show in Hershey PA and having a one hour meeting with the Pleasure Way rep there. Unfortunately we were unable to test drive the unit we met with the rep in at the show, so problem solved our best paths to accomplish this important task. He said our best bet was to find one at a dealership to test drive it before ordering.

We have been making plans for this purchase for months, financially and otherwise. We have had extensive communications with the dealer near our home in central PA about this purchase in 2019.

We are also homeowners in AZ, so were in town for one week managing an extensive home remodel, but made the time to seek out an Ascent to test drive. These vehicles are like finding a needle in a haystack, so seeing we will be plunking down over 150k on this vehicle, we obviously will need to test drive one at some point. None have been available in our area to date.

My husband phoned LaMesa to see if they had any on the lot , explaining our goals. He was told they did not, so we knocked that task off our lengthy list of items to accomplish during our short visit.

Yesterday the salesman phoned us saying they just got two units on the lot and we could take one out. We rearranged our entire day, extended our rental car, changed the time for my birthday luncheon in order to drive across Phoenix from Tempe to make this test drive.

The salesman who invited us had the day off, so arranged for another salesperson, Damon, to take care of us. We drove 40 min through heavy traffic for this test drive.

Upon arriving, Damon informed us he had another appt so handed us off to another salesman Barry to show us the RV.

We were taken to an office and left there. After 10 min. Barry returned with his manager Angelo who informed us that we actually would not be allowed to test drive this RV- the sole reason for our visit.

He used words like ""we can't let the general public just come in here and drive our vehicles if they are not planning to buy one from us"". 

My husband had been abundantly clear that we live across the country in PA and had been seeking this specific vehicle to test drive in preparation for our upcoming order in 2019. My husband got so frustrated he walked out. I then spoke with Barry and Angelo
who treated me with astonishing disrespect, even with my repeated explanations that we had been invited for the sole purpose of test driving this Ascent. That it was my birthday, we had driven 40 min to get there and had just arranged our entire last busy day in town via this request and offer of their dealership.

They were unmoving and I walked out only to have Angelo hurl an insult at my back.

We are professionals with the means and plans to purchase this vehicle. We may have even considered an AZ purchase and driven it back to PA next year.

But after the rude and unnecessary abuse we received from Angelo and Barry (Russ the salesman who invited us to come today, was called after this debacle and said it should have never happened, and there is no dealership policy that indicates you can't test a car without signing a contract to purchase, as Angelo has the audacity to try and sell my husband), we will never do any business on any level with any LaMesa RV.

And I will be following up with a letter detailing this fiasco to the Pleasure Way Company educating them on how their vehicles are being sold...or not."
2,5,"I couldn't be happier with the La Mesa team!! They took the time to answer all of my questions, I had a lot, with honest answers and opinions. All aspects were perfect, sales, finance, delivery, and customer service. These guys are true professionals! After reading the posted reviews I kept waiting for the glitch and after going through the whole process there wasn't one, just nice people, happy with their jobs, eager to help us with a gorgeous new toy hauler!!

Thank you La Mesa, you guys rock!!"
2,1,"The most important point of this review is the fact that warranty service can be provided at any authorized vendor.  Even though you may purchase a RV at La Mesa you can have it serviced elsewhere.  In my case I am getting great service from Camping World Phoenix.  The service at La Mesa was non existent, lied, didn't communicate and didn't know what they were doing.
Found a beautiful 5th wheel at one of the numerous La Mesa shows.  A lot of people go through these rvs so we spent about 45 minutes with the sales person identifying things that were damaged and needed to be resolved.  A month later when turnover was happening found that none of these items were taken care of.  Not only that but I was misled that the 6 point auto level was working.  They had the unit all hooked up and leveled.  Found left and right wires on leveling board swapped after taking delivery.  With these swapped the RV could NEVER auto level yet it was level at turnover.  If auto level was pushed it actually drove the RV to a dangerous position because it was driving the wrong side.  There was no way they could have used the auto level feature.  Unfortunately I had to figure this out on our first shake down trip.  Took a bit of google research and time wasted.  There was an obvious hydraulic leak that was ignored as well.  There was fluid all over by the fluid container.  It was clear that they tried to clean and hide the issue so they could get it out the door. Found this when I was loading the front of it and also noticed fluid dripping down one of the jacks.
The person doing the turnover instructions was very nice but made multipole mistakes.  This wasn't my first RV so I knew he was wrong about such things as the reset on the AC converter and telling me erroneously that the small fridge in outdoor kitchen was powered during travel.  These were small things but you should expect more from a so called expert.  The biggest mistake was telling me there was only 1 grey tank and all valves and hook ups were behind one outside door.   This would be a great feature if it was true.  After kitchen sink started filling up found another release valve back by one of the axels. 
The salesman who was great at the show stated that he would always be calling service on my behalf and communicated with me early on but nothing ever got done.  The major disappointment I had with the salesman was that he didn't bother to show during my turnover.  There were issues at turnover and no one to discuss these with.  I was told 3 different times that they would get the service manager and that he was in, but he couldn't find the time over about 3 hours to show up either.  After the turnover information my wife and I were left standing outside waiting for a manager or a sales person.  From that time we were completely ignored.  After about an hour I hitched the RV up on my own and left.
From this point the communication from service and sales on the remaining punch list items just got worse.  I never received one return call from service.   After figuring out that another company could service the unit I have since received great communication and service from Camping World Phoenix.  It has been so good that I feel somewhat guilty that I didn't make my purchase with them.
In closing their wasn't one aspect of this purchase that wasn't handled poorly with the exception of a large selection of RVs at the show.  If you can find a unit you love and avoid La Mesa it would probably be a good thing."
2,1,"I need to get service on my RV that I bought last December, the heater is acting up and not working it would come on when it wasn't even on and not working at night when the temperature got done to 32' as we went camping in the month of February . So I called to make an appointment they told me they can't get me until May 15 so they hold me hostage right now and  can't going camping. This is ridiculous they should be sending me somewhere else to take care of this, Think about this before you buy there or do you service there"
2,1,"Thinking about buying a RV La Mesa on 75th Ave wife was quoted on price monthly payment down payment
Monthly payment about $550.00 per month down payment of $2,500.00 after my wife took it out for test drive. Then they said ok to run credit report. So now we have a hard credit inquiry for no reason n they use one credit reporting company THAT'S RIGHT ONE CREDIT AGENCY NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY. 

That's when everything started to change payments went from  $2500.00 down payment up to about $4500.00.  Had to put $500.00 down to hold it n now I have to try n get my deposit on hold back started out with one sale person (Dan) he was very nice but ended up with 3 people 

Try n get pre-approved before hand urself though ur bank or credit union 

They claim to be the largest RV dealership in Az.  

We r learning a lot about buying an RV 

PLEASE DO UR HOMEWORK BEFORE STEPPING ON TO THE DEALERSHIP LOT"
2,5,"After having a horrific experience at another RV dealership I turned to La Mesa RV service dept for assistance. I couldn't be any happier with my experience. They scheduled my appointment for the following day, listened to my concerns and communicated with me constantly with updates. I had a trip planned for the weekend and was hoping to have my rv ready for use in just 3 days time and they delivered that promise. When I arrived to pick it up it was pulled foreword and ready for hook up. Thank you Keith, Nathan, Freddy, Skip and the technician, who's name I don't know, for your exceptional performance. I appreciate your service. Because of you my family Was able to enjoy our weekend with confidence!"
2,5,"we bought our RV from LA Mesa 2 months ago, last week we were going to take it out for our first trip and found a problem. With only a day to get it corrected they made room for us in service and in just over a hour the problem was fixed. Outstanding service!!!"
2,1,"We purchased a toyhauler from La Mesa RV.  At the time of purchase the service was fine.  We bought it used and it had some flaws and we bought it as is so that was fine, it was still in good condition.

Unfortunately, we wanted to order some very simple parts, just for cosmetic repairs.  Three times we sent emails, made phone calls, sent pictures of what we needed. We went round and round with the parts department, terrible service, a very rude incompetent woman,would not return phone calls, and most of the time nobody would answer the phone when we tried to call them, and left multiple messages still no response.  When we were able to reach a live person they acted like we were bothering them, and we have not received any information, not even to get a price or if they are even able to get us our parts, its been a month and nothing.  Don't bother with this place."
2,1,"Well now I know why they have 1 and a half stars. Where to begin. Bought MH in October and took it back for repairs in November. They had it til April. Damages the body and put hole in dash. I have photos to prove it. Didn't repair everything on the list of items. Kept telling me it's not covered under warranty but never offered another way. Sent them four emails and never received a call or response. Had a survey on the phone. Lady said corporate would be calling me. Never did!! 
They have you by the  because you are traveling and now I cannot leave it there for the necessary repairs. Theybrag about their service but don't follow through. 
NEVER GO THERE YOU Will Be SORRY!"
2,1,"Made a deal with the sales guy and when I went away to think about it, I came back and said that I would accept the deal.  Sales guy said the price would actually be several thousand higher.   I asked what happened? I thought we had a price?  He said that was just a starting price to take to the manager.  Total and complete BS!   We agreed on a price and I told him I would consult with my wife and he said let me know after you talk to her.  Why would I even consult with my wife on a price that was not the actual price???

Also he failed to be up front about a delivery charge to bring unit in from 11 hours away.  He said it would be 2500 dollars to have it delivered!!!!! What???  Wow that is some serious delivery charge!!!  What a joke. That came up after we had a so called deal as well. 

Shady sales guy that gives the industry a bad name.  Went straight to camping world and was treated with honesty and integrity.   Never again"

2,1,"It would be a less than star if possible. DON'T EVER buy anything from the LAMESA RV on 
75th Ave and McDowell. The one and only good thing I can say about this place is we liked the salesman. Unfortunately since we signed on the dotted line, we have had nothing but trouble. LOTS, and LOTS of craftsmanship issues. Extremely poor quality THOR product. So needless to say the coach we bought has been in the shop more than we've been on the road. Even though the product is sold at this location, evidently, everything that is wrong with it has to be approved by the manufacturer to be repaired. EVEN if it's brand NEW and has a warranty. That's the excuse we've been given several times for our RV being in their possession for VERY long periods of time. Wouldn't you think in these days of the PHONE, COMPUTER, our Hi-Tech times of the year 2016, you could get approval almost momentarily. When they want your money they sure get that approval fast. HMMMMM

Now about the service department. Our assigned service advisors name is EDDIE CLAYTON. Whatever you do don't accept him. He is a LIAR. He tells you what he thinks you want to hear then denies it later. I've asked him through an e-mail to communicate with us through e-mail so we won't have so many misunderstandings but he won't do that. Obviously, he doesn't want anything in writing, I wonder why. He never follows through with anything. He called us to tell us our coach is ready and hasn't even verified everything he said would be done is done. Then when I question him about when it will be ready he gets flustered with me and hangs up on me. NICE right? I have so many more examples of problems with him but I'd have to write a book to include them all. We're in our sixties and have purchased many homes, automobiles, RV's and major purchases and we have NEVER had such POOR customer service.

Suffice it to say we would NEVER recommend anyone to use this location of LAMESA RV"
2,5,"We cannot begin to tell you how pleased we are with LaMesa. We have been traveling from FL since the beginning of June; 7,000 miles. We had some maintenance issues my husband wanted taken care of. We had an appointment, arrived a little early but no worries Skip came out, wrote up our issues and we left, knowing that most likely we would need to bring the coach back in tomorrow as they would probably need to order parts. In our minds we knew this would be a project and allocated a week to get or come close to getting things fixed. Now, for the cool part. We stopped back by the service center around 2:00 just to find out how things were going and discovered everything was done! Done! The guys were out there washing it off and after shooting the breeze with Nathan we were back on the road. Who would have thought?Repairs (major repairs)done in one day! Thanks Nathan and Skip!"
2,4,"I had a mixed bag experience at La Mesa RV. Found the motor home on craigslist at their dealership at an incredible price so we bought it with the understanding that it was in great shape. FYI - we live 1500 miles away. Did all the paperwork remotely and gave them a down payment on our credit card. A month later we flew out to pick it up.
The dealership was super-slammed trying to deliver a ton of vehicles they had sold the week before at an RV show, but still I was a little surprised our unit wasn't waiting for us since they had a month to get it ready. We waited and finally they sent someone to give us the walk through. I'm not sure if they were short-handed and sent someone that wasn't used to doing it but he tried to tell me that of the two batteries under the step, one of them was the coach battery. I corrected him and we moved on. Pretty much everything else went well with the walk-through with one issue of the faucet leaking so they took it in for service while we did the paperwork.
Did the paperwork with a great lady, but there was a glitch on payment. Our credit union check was $5000 short of the price (which we knew going in) and we expected to put the amount on our credit card. They told us that we put $5000 down payment on a credit card and that was their limit per transaction. I understand that, but we typically don't carry checks so there wasn't an alternative and they accepted the card. They did try to sell us (expensive) gap insurance but considering we bought the coach for $40,000 LESS than it was insured for, we passed.
The whole process took much longer than expected but they were slammed so I can't fault them for all of it.
After we got home they gave us a follow-up call to see if everything was alright and a month after that a part for the motor home showed up. There must have been some kind of confusion because we didn't need a window locking lever but we now have one for a spare.
All in all I would go back to La Mesa RV if I was in the market for another RV."
2,1,"I wish I would have read the reviews on yelp before we bought there, lousy lousy service department. It's like they say, you get what you pay for, even if you get the product for thousands cheaper it's not worth dealing with them"
2,3,"Due to the 5 and 1 star review we are giving the company as a whole a 3 star review.

Sales: 5 Star
We purchased our Class A motorhome from here. Noah and Ryan worked with us in the beginning and they were nice and helpful. When we looked at a Tiffin Bill Rogers (brogers@lamesarv.com) came out to assist. He is incredibly knowledgeable about Tiffin, and he was so informative. Bill went above and beyond explaining the difference of the RV's, and he worked to ensure we had the best fit for us. Angelo is the Sales Manager. He literally answered every question no matter how small, and he was the most gracious person to work with for us. We were brand new to learning about RV's. Angelo held our to hand and helped us with everything from purchasing to questions after we were home figuring things out. We recommend working with this sales team when purchasing!

Service: 1 Star
On the complete other hand is the service department. We purchased the extended warranty for our rig, and we had to use it a few times on different things. We have had our rig since September 2017. It is now May 2018 and we still have a Blu Ray/DVD player issue that has yet to be resolved. We have endured no call backs, having to follow up ourselves for parts, and at some points people have been rude to us. We only went there for service because of the warranty. Do your service somewhere else. 

Due to the 5 and 1 star review we are giving the company as a whole a 3 star review."
2,1,"Well now I know why they have 1 and a half stars. Where to begin. Bought MH in October and took it back for repairs in November. They had it til April. Damages the body and put hole in dash. I have photos to prove it. Didn't repair everything on the list of items. Kept telling me it's not covered under warranty but never offered another way. Sent them four emails and never received a call or response. Had a survey on the phone. Lady said corporate would be calling me. Never did!! 
They have you by the  because you are traveling and now I cannot leave it there for the necessary repairs. Theybrag about their service but don't follow through. 
NEVER GO THERE YOU Will Be SORRY!!
In addition, had body work done after hitting a deer. Was on a trip and started getting dark. I had no headlights. Got to destination and checked under hood. They never plugged them into the electric harness. This just tells me they never checked their work before releasing the vehicle to me. I can and will go on and on.

26 days ago A reply from LaMesa stated they were conducting an investigation. First you need to talk to the unhappy customer and I still have not received a call from LaMesa RV. That tells me they are looking one sided and they will not know what really happened that made me unhappy."
2,5,"We were most pleased with our experience at La Mesa.  The building and facilities are impressive, and even offer free brats and hotdogs daily. Their inventory was incredible, having 100's of units to go through. Upfront, we met the best salesman (Maurice) for our RV.  He immediately made us feel comfortable and we told him EXACTLY what we wanted. He didn't try to show us units we were not interested in or up-sell us. We had searched their inventory online prior to going in and we also told him the max budget we wanted to stay within.  After discovering the unit was actually at the other La Mesa location, our salesman offered to drive over to pick it up for us.  We got the unit back and immediately fell in love.  Talked numbers and told them what we had to put down.  The finance manager took extra time out of his day to talk about different tow vehicle options for us.  Lauren (in fiancé) also made us feel comfortable when signing paperwork.  We bought the unit in AZ but live out of state, so we hoped to have unit ready within a few days so we could be on the road ASAP.  They fit us in to pick up the rig within 3 days (we were told this usually takes at least a week to have them be ready for delivery).  Again, when we went to pick up the rig, our salesman was there (even though it was his day off) to make sure all went smooth.  Lauren again was very helpful in answering any questions we had.  She also didn't try to pressure us to buy extended warranties, clear coat, etc. (although we did buy them) but she did not pressure us.  Everybody was also very friendly when we were telling them our travel plans...they told us RV-friendly routes and even gave us a travel map book to go by. 

Kenny (in service) did our walk through and he did more than meet our expectations.  He spend at least 1 1/2 hours with us, answering any details and made us feel comfortable.  This was our first Class A unit and although owning travel trailers before, the information was overwhelming.  Kenny was patient and did not make us feel dumb for asking many questions.  After buying the unit, we were told we had 15 days within delivery to fix any kinks we notice.  Since we live out of state, we contacted Kenny and Danny about getting those (minimal) things looked at the next time we were in Phoenix (which will be in March).  They were very accommodating and also have answered questions over the phone about using special features with the rig (without feeling annoyed).  

Again, overall our experience was fantastic.  We will go to La Mesa every spring (we are snowbirds) to have them perform all the servicing on the rig.  It is unfortunate to read the negative reviews with this place, as we experienced such a positive one.  We will most likely buy our future rigs with La Mesa.  They worked hard to please us and have deserved our trust.  Will report more once we go through our walk-thru in March."
2,5,Hands down the best transaction. Everyone was so nice. Even got freshly baked cookies. What a great team. Thank you
2,5,"La Mesa RV and their staff were absolutely amazing during our ""Emergency"" purchase on 6/2/16.  Our 22 year old motorhome broke down on our road trip back from NY and we were stuck in Phoenix not knowing the area at all.  My daughter back at home directed us to a dealership (La Mesa RV) that was only 4 miles from where we were.  She called ahead to let them know that my wife and I were on our way.  They greeted us by name and could not have been more accommodating or friendly.  My initial intent was to repair the old motorhome and be on our way, but they had such a large inventory of beautiful motorhomes that we couldn't help but buy a gorgeous Pace Arrow by Fleetwood.  Angelo Arena, the sales agent literally spent two days with us helping unload our old RV and packing up the new one.  We had all of our grandson's belongings because we had just celebrated his graduation from West Point and we were helping him cart everything home.  Needless to say there was a ton of unpacking and packing up of the new motorhome, a truly exhausting job, but Angelo smiled and helped through the whole ordeal.  We also dealt with Eli the service manager and Penny Foray the service advisor and many of the other staff members.  Everyone was exemplary.  They took what could have been a desperate and upsetting situation and made it a wonderful memory.  We absolutely love our new motorhome, it is everything we have been searching for at our local California dealerships and had been unable to find.  We truly were treated like royalty!
We highly recommend La Mesa RV!

Tom and Linda Giandomenico/Happy Campers!"
2,1,"DO NOT BUY A CAMPER HERE!

I purchased at Rowley White (love them)  for a Genesis and before them i had a Stellar Fifth wheel which i purchased from Cactus RV in Tuscon (also love them) and I REGRETTABLY bought my third camper from LA MESA RV. They are absolutely horrid, good luck trying to get a call back.

I dropped my Cyclone fifth wheel (which i purchased brand new 10/15/17) off at their service center at the end of November because all the jacks failed, the slider stopped working and the fascia fell off.... it is now 1/31/18 and no one bothers to return my phone call and let me know the status of the repair. I should also add this is the third time i have had to take it in, i have called 4 times over the last two months and my ""service adviser"" Richie, has NEVER called me back. 

I called Heartland and complained to them, only to be told that ""La Mesa RV is the worst of all the service centers that repair Heartland products.""

Don't make the same mistake i did, don't by a Heartland product and certainly DO NOT go to La Mesa RV."
2,1,"My husband and I have a fifth wheel , stopped in more so to see what's available because we're looking to trade in and upgrade in the near future not necessarily right now. First salesman who greeted us, nice guy but swore in front of my kids 1 minute after meeting us (they're 3 and 1 years old) and asked us a few times "" what turns you on?"" When it comes to the type of rv we were looking for. Creepy. I would like to mention me and my husband cuss like sailors so we have nothing against foul language but it just showed how unprofessional he was to do that to people he just met. Showed us a couple new fifth wheels, then a used one that is the same model as ours but bigger and newer and the price was decent so we thought we'd do some numbers to see our trade in value and payments etc. Different salesman took over and did our paperwork, kissed our butts, overly nice and tried to relate to us. I know the game but anyway, they wanted to offer us HALF of what our rv is worth. Secondly, they came back with astronomical numbers as far as payments go and the finance guy is a total jerk. The more we said the offer wasn't going to work and to see if they can give us a better one the more they insulted us saying we got ripped off on our rv and we shouldn't have paid that much. They do the take your drivers license before the paperwork trick and my husband had to ask them multiple times to give them back and every time he did the guy would go get another offer instead of our licenses. Eventually, my husband just said we'd have to talk about it at home because we were there so long my kids fell asleep in the car and I was waiting outside. The guy ripped the offer out of my husbands hands and said rudely "" happy hunting"". I don't care if I won the lottery tomorrow, I still would not even buy anything from them and weird not even an hour or so later after we left  we get phone calls from the dealership . I'll pass. Thanks!"
2,1,"Worst customer service I have ever gotten. I purchased a new $100,000 plus RV. It has tons of problems. A lot of things that leak, don't work and are falling apart. I've been waiting for 5 months for the sink faucet to be ordered. My phone messages and emails are not returned. When I spoke with the manager about the problems he shrugged his shoulders."
2,1,"There is not a zero available so had to rate 1 star. During our orientation, we were told if there were any issues we would be put at the top of the schedule for repairs since this is a brand new coach. We have had our NEW Winnebago in for repair since July 24, 2018 for something that should have been fixed before we even picked it up on July 6, 2018. Tom Grader was our former service advisor and we were notified on July 24 he is no longer with La Mesa. We waited around on July 24 for an hour for another service advisor to help us. We spoke with Little James (just hired) and he advised it would be approximately 2 weeks for the repairs. We told him that we haven't even been able to use it...it is brand new and these issues should have been caught prior to us picking up. NOT HAPPY!!!! 

We were told last week by Little James the parts would be in August 9, 2018 and pick up would be August 13 or 14, 2018. We called today and talked with Little James and he said the parts are not expected until August 15, 2018, and we are looking at August 21, 2018 at the earliest for pickup. This is unacceptable. We sent an email to Ken Allen, orientation tech, today asking for his help. Let's see if what he told us on July 6, 2018 was sincere. Will be posting daily until we we this resolved."
2,1,"Awful customer service and no accountability. The sales reps are little to no help when you actually need their help and the manager could care less about the customers.
Beware going through this company. I would avoid at all costs."
2,1,"DO NOT BUY FROM La Mesa RV. Many reviews have already stated similar experiences to mine. Horrible customer service. They smoke and have filthy mouths. This is not okay especially around my children. Found a camper I really liked at Camping world and they talk so much crap about any brand or dealer that is not them. I had many dealers greet me however once I started asking questions or being ""too much"" for them to handle the sales person would disappear. You better believe I'm going to ask a million questions and nit pick the heck out of a TOY I am purchasing for over 30K. Stay far away from the RV shows they have at the stadium as well."
2,5,"I just bought a new 2014 Tiffin Allegro Open Road from Bill Traynor at La Mesa RV in Phoenix (not their Mesa store).  He was great...very knowledgeable and patient with us.  This is our first RV and I know we made the right decision to work with Bill.
Bill is honest, helpful, courteous, kind, trustworthy etc etc.  
Give him a call at 623-295-3000 or visit him at 7525 W. McDowell Rd, Phoenix.
Mike F."
2,5,"Purchased a used RV from them. My sales person, Bill Traynor, was extremely helpful and very patient. He addressed all my issues and concerns and I feel he gave me a very good deal. I can recommend Bill as your next RV sales person."
2.5,2,"I'm unsure why it is called Camping World when all they really have is mobile homes, camper trailers and equipment designed for such. Their website advertised that they had pop-up tent trailers and camping equipment. They did not really have either. But if you need a satellite receiver and a memory foam king size bed topper for your 'camping' experience, they have that sort of thing. 

The sales associates ignored me completely, and chose instead to speak exclusively to the man I had with me, even when I tried to talk to their floor staff about their selection while they took him out to see their 1 pop up tent trailer. (Which was so far away from their store that they had to drive him to it.)  I stayed behind to look for camping gear, and came up disappointed and un-helped there, so we went to nearby Gander Mt. for that afterwards.

Eventually when the men folk returned from a disappointing viewing of their 1 relevant item, he decided to leave his information with the sales rep in case they had something suiting our needs come along. They asked him for a copy of his drivers license, which he said he would do but on the condition that he be allowed to see them make 1 copy only and block out his license number.  So, they took him to an office room to do this.  Once they brought him in, a different sales guy was sitting at the desk and turned to him and said ""Sir, can I ask you to please leave.""  Of course the answer was no, not until I have my license back. He was quite rude about wanting him to leave him alone in the office with his sensitive documents. Eventually he backed down until the license was copied and returned. 

Overall unpleasant experience, yielding no results, and making us feel uncomfortable with the idea of making a large purchase with them.  Maybe they would have treated us with more respect if we had been looking to buy a $40,000 mobile home instead of a basic, more rustic pop up trailer in the range of 'only a few thousand dollars.'"
2.5,5,Camping world of Wisconsin provided excellent service from start to finish. We received our 2017 coleman 3015bh with the best price and service over any other camping world. The finance guys provided the financing that was superior and even shipped the unit to me and sent registration directly to DMV. The general manager followed up by contacting us to ensure the service met our expectations.  Great service and customer relations is why this camping world is A+ with us.
2.5,5,"Camping World / Madison, goes ""GOLD"" with us! We recently purchased a 2017 Forest River R-Pod 179.  Our experience from beginning to end was one of the BEST I have ever had in my entire life. Seriously!!!  In a world that seems to be spinning out of control and where Corporate ONLY thinks about money or gain, this was truly an exception to the rule.  I quickly presented my medical challenges, vehicle size towing capacity and financial limits in order to give Valerie Tinberg-Larson, my RV Sales Associate, an idea of what would fit our needs.  We immediately viewed several of the 2017 R-Pod trailers, the 171, 177,  & 179. The 179 Series met all three conditions stated with more then enough room to go on the road for months. I asked for a night to think through and study everything that was presented, and texted Valerie the next morning to meet and sign.  (She did not have to be in until 9:00am, but came in 45 mins. early just to give me another walk-through and help me get the paperwork rolling.) We have forged a lifelong friendship because of her compassion and consideration that was taken to heart from the get-go.
Once approved by her manager on the price requested, I had the privilege of meeting and working with David Arndt, the Financial Solutions Manager. Again, I was made to feel like family and David considered my medical challenges on how to advise me for adding Trip Assistance / Roadside Assistance / Emergency Alert and the Paint Protection in an affordable package with 5-6 year warranties. He made me ""worry-free."" 
His tender-hearted demeanor and genuine concern for all my needs was clear and I will be forever grateful for his advice and encouragement to purchase the options. 
Paul Miller, Walk-Through Genius (!) gave me the most comprehensive tour of my camper I could ever have hoped for.  I took extensive notes with added information based on Paul's personal experiences ""over a lifetime"" that will be endlessly helpful.  Paul gave me his phone number to call so that on my first night camping across from Camping World, I would be able to access him for ANY questions or concerns.  And when I had a faulty LP gauge, he ""came to my campsite"" at 8:00am the next morning BEFORE work, to answer my questions and help me fix my two glitches.  Like Valerie and David, Paul is another genuinely amazing individual focused on my specific needs, who came out of friendship to assist me with ""experiences on the learning curve"" with a new camper.
I cannot thank them enough for helping to begin my ""next great adventure,"" starting my golden years.  
Please stop in and meet them, you will be touched by their kindness, expertise, practical suggestions and polite and courteous manner.  They are quality individuals who love what they do and are ready to give you an experience of a lifetime. Corporate may be lurking, but they remind me of ""Make A Wish"" staff that I once worked with, and no matter what, they'll help you find a way to make your dream come true!

2.5,1,"Arrived on 8.7.15 out of Ohio. Just stopped in to get a tube of roof leveling chalking. They had only two registers long lines with some type of confusion at both registers. Meanwhile the service desk had plenty of guys behind computers at the counter, hopefully not playing games, and nobody offered to get up to see if they could help out. I placed item back on the shelf and left without a greeting going in or a thanks for coming in when I left."
2.5,1,"I had the displeasure of stopping at camping world today. I was on the lot for 90 min, forget about getting a sales person to help you. There are happy to point and one person actually stated ""maybe I will stop back but be sure you leave before they lock the gate or you will be stuck. Apparently no sales person walks the lot to see if any customers are there and the prices for most of the  A class are kept on the sales person sheet so you don't get to see them. Now why would you not post the prices on something you want to sell? Sales people and management don't seem to care. Overall I will spend my money elsewhere. 
I don't know how they got the 1/2 star, they should be happy to get that gift. I give them 0 stars but Yelp is very generous and makes you give at least one star. 

8/8/16 well thanks to camping world 's performance I am happy to say the I purchased an ACE Rv from Collier RV in Rockford.  Amazingly enough we were greeted, treated wonderfully and did not feel like a trespasser .
So any way, Camping world can suck it."

2.5,1,"Don't go here for service.  Poor communication.  They dont fix it.  They overcharge and their customer service is poor at best.  I have brought my RV there 3 times for various fixes and nothing but a nightmare every time.  
Bad.  Really bad."
5,5,I was referred by a good friend and just wanted to say they did a fabulous job on my car!! Looks better then before the accident! I will recommend these guys to all my friends.
5,5,"This shop is great in many ways. I am very picky with repairs to my vehicle. Paint job was flawless, all parts align perfectly.  The manager, and front desk staff are more than helpful, and professional. Picked up my car spotless as if nothing had happened to it! Thanks guys!"
5,5,"5 star Incredible Service! They paid my deductible of $1000.00. They went way over and beyond what was expected. Took the time to wash, wax, and polish my Prius before giving it to back to me. It looks better than when it was brand new."
5,5,"I would like to thank master tech very much for solving my issue in a heartbeat without any stress. A few days ago I damaged my left mirror while backing out of my garage and left the mirror cracked and some pieces ended up being out of place. Once I requested assistance from Master Tech, they solved my problem immediately the very next day. And their service was very polite as well. I would highly recommend for you to choose Master Tech when it comes to any type of collision relating to your car. You definitely will not regret your decision."
5,5,"I was visiting Phoenix and got in to small accident,
I didn't know the area,so started to look for a auto place true yelp,and believe me this guys deserve all the stars they have!!!!
Professional costumer service!!!!
Reasonable prices!!!!!!
They didn't take advantage on fact that I am a visitor hear,they gave me a quote,and fixed my car like nothing happened!!!!
Thank you guys!!!"
4,1,"This place is an absolute joke. I dropped my car off Wednesday night to get a exhaust leak fixed(a foot long pipe). Thursday I get a call telling me they have 3 price options, including fixing motor mounts???? I told the guy there I just wanted the exhaust fixed. He told me it will be done Friday morning. Friday came and I hadn't heard anything by 3pm so I call to check. Once again the guy tells me it will be done by the next morning. Saturday around 10 am and still no call, so I call back to check. Once again the same guy says that it will be done this afternoon. I told him I will be there at 12pm so have it done. I get there at 12:15 and he hands me the keys and says try Meineke!!! I couldn't believe what I heard, I asked him why it was not done and he said he doesn't work on the cars and he has no idea why it is not done. I reminded him that when we spoke Thursday it was on the lift, so why not finish then? Again an I don't know. This was the worst experience of any shop I ever had, very unprofessional. Go at your own risk."
4,5,"This place is amazing. The owners of this company are MORE than willing to work with you in any circumstances. They have a ""no"" BS attitude and treat you with fairness. I would recommend them to ANYONE! The service is s wonderful and the friendly attitude is refreshing. And a woman, I feel very comfortable having my car worked on there and know that I am.not being taken advantage i
Of."
4,5,"This place is amazing! Not only do they offer great prices and solid work, but when I totaled my car 4 days after having some major maintenance done, they spoke to the insurance adjuster with me and made sure he was aware of how much money I spent on the car just the week before! They actually helped me get all the money I spent on maintenance back through my insurance claim! You can't beat that kind of service!!"
4,5,Always great and fast service very friendly staff always helpful in trying to give advice on the upkeep of your vehicle
4,5,"You will not find a better mechanic in the Charlotte/Concord/Harrisburg area than the guys at Automotive Anything. When we moved to Harrisburg I had a van that needed some work. Originally I took it to another mechanic who quoted me over $500. On a whim I decided to stop by Automotive Anything and see what they would quote me. Not only was the price lower but they were honest about what really needed to be done versus what the first shop quoted me. That was almost 3 years ago.

Since then we've brought our cars in for everything from regular oil changes to full service jobs. We've recommended them to friends and family who have since all become loyal customers. 


If you're looking for an HONEST, FAIR and WELL QUALIFIED auto shop that will do quality work then definitely check out Automotive Anything."
4,5,"Wow!  What great service!  Both Andrew and Chris got me in and out super fast!  Fixed the issue and I was out the door! 
Thanks for the great service on my Tommy Lift gate!"
4,5,Thank you ASH from One Big Party Bus. I really appreciate your honesty on my AC unit. I can't thank you enough for quick and cost effective turn around allowing me to keep the bus going. I will never go anywhere else and will continue to highly recommend your services to everyone I know.
4,4,This place specializes in all sorts of equipment for auto and truck. They install bed liners tool boxes and strobe lights for your work vehicles.  If you need parts for hitches RV or trailers the check it out.
4,2,Went inside with my 3 kids in tow to get some things a police officer told me I needed on a traffic inspection of my truck. Walked in went to back counter and talked to a man named Juan I told him I needed help he immediately just started jawing off isles to look in??? So I went to another counter bumped into a man I am assuming was the manager he was very kind walked with me to a place I was hoping would help however he took me back to Juan who wasn't interested in doing anything other than telling me where to look !! When someone is shopping with kids especially at a store like this it's ok to help them carry heavy items to their truck so they don't have to make multiple trips in and out also carrying a car seat I believe Juan deserves to be fired but I am giving this store 2 stars as the manager was very kind and helpful.
4,3,"Well I came for what would have been expected to be a quick visit for 4 small issues to make me safe to keep going on the road with a truck I just bought. 

Rayce was my service advisor and Paul was my mechanic. 

#1. My turn signals and brake lights worked but the running lights were not working when I plugged my trailer in. Without a trailer the circuit would reset and work fine so I asked for them to start by replacing the trailer connector on the truck first to see if it would help. 3 Hours later the tech had looked at possibly every other wire on the truck and not the plug I asked for. Finally the plug was not the problem but apparently a bad wire under the truck... So my guess was incorrect after all. 

#2. The trailer brakes also were not working which also made me believe it was the connector or wires going into it. The power was to the controller and going to the wires in the plug, but not actuating the brakes. It turned out there was a missing all time power wire to the trailer to run the pump for the hydraulic brakes. The tech ran a power wire and that was that.

Since it took 3 hours to find the first one wire problem I asked for status updates every hour or so while I was waiting and walking around outside to kill time it seemed I was bothering the service writer even though he was not on the phone or doing too much. I don't think they guy was trying to be rude, but I was getting anxious as the labor rates were building up...

#3. I had an air leak for my airbag leveling system where the air lines go in and out of the leveling controller? (not sure what it is called) on the frame. We didn't get that done for lack of a part for this trip. 

#4. My trailer axles were out of alignment from the factory by more than 1.2""!!! They fixed that super quick and that is a relief... Apparently PJ Trailers does not have great quality control!

When you are paying anywhere near $100 an hour you really want to see progress and feel respected and know your money is buying services and not merely time taking that builds your bill.

I would recommend this place but as with anywhere do your due diligence and pay attention to what is going on. There must be faster service somewhere. Paying that much for service means the customer has a right to feel frustrated to see the tech talking to other techs leaning on the truck talking and taking so much time. 

3 hours to diagnose a wire seems crazy since we knew which wire it must have been as it controls the running lights only. One could have replaced the entire wire in less time. I feel that was quite a lot of labor for that issue. 

My other issues were resolved in a reasonable time. All in all I can continue in my trip now with less worry. 

Rayce worked with me in some of the labor for the long diagnosis and I appreciate that a bunch. That was worth the 4th star!

In summary, a quick fix can be costly here or anywhere if you have bad luck or less than speedy diagnosis! One experience cannot judge a place based on one visit but I also cannot give a super awesome recommendation either."
2.5,1,Horrible. Dave at the front desk used the F-word on the phone when I called in. Very rude.
2.5,1,"Front desk not knowledgeable. Maintenance staff has no clue how to properly make repairs on many issues. Manager knowingly hides significant and dangerous problems with residences when selling ""as-is"" contracts... which is illegal, even when selling ""as-is"" it must be safely habitable. They have meters for each lot, yet charge a ""flat fee"" anyway, regardless of water usage. Their contracts are so full of binding wordage that you will never be allowed to make repairs to your residence.... so most residences are falling apart in the park, even when the residents want to make repairs and keep their place looking good! Do NOT trust these people... You will regret it!"
2.5,5,"I like it here, not much drama. Most are rented by couples with families, my son enjoys the park and pool. For a mobile home park it is extremely clean and quiet. I do not think you will find one in mesa this clean or quiet for the price. I also like that the management is not in your business but they know your name..They let you pay half rent if you dont have the entire amount with out fees (which is hard to come across in AZ) I found everyone at the office to be extremely helpful. I have never had an issue with them being rude, they always give my son ice cream or a balloon. I love this place and will continue to live here, the only bummer is the extra amenities that I can not use because I rent, but I think that the trade offs are even :)"
2.5,5,"LENGTHY BUT WORTHY review. This is the best place I have lived for ""apartment"" and rental living. One of the best things about this place is that they are not apartments. They are single family manufactured homes available for rent or purchase. The office and maintenance staff are genuinely friendly and maintenance response is quick. The crime rate is very low. Neighbors are friendly. Pet- and family-friendly community. Great location, easy freeway access, and close to shopping centers. There is a large lot in the south of the complex with open grassy area, a gazebo and table for picnics etc, and a jungle gym for kids. 
The rent is fair; it varies per unit, but we are paying $700 (+ tax) for a 2010 two bed two bath manufactured home, and the only reason we did not purchase was because it was actually less expensive to rent. We also have free access to the pool, gym, and only a pet deposit vs deposit + add'l pet rent. It is a GATED community, and infractions regarding are taken very seriously, which to me is a great thing! Previous places I lived that were ""gated,"" the gate was open almost the entire time, so what was the point of that? 
Yes, the water is shut off every 4 weeks, but they give plenty of notice, and it's always the 4th Tuesday of the month. It was never inconvenient."
2.5,3,"Great location to live, easy freeway aceess. Close to all the new shopping and city re-developments.  Would give better rating except that they offer better amenities to seasonal residents then the permanent ones like us.  They get to use the billiards room, hot tub, rec room, etc.  We are not allowed to use any of that.  Just a pool and an exercise room. Sad!"
2.5,1,"I have had such an awful experience with this place. Me and my husband put a down payment on a property on 4/4/16. Our estimated move in date was originally June 15th, was then moved to July 15th, then to August 15th me and my husband waited because we honestly wanted this property, it's a nice neighborhood and the prices were fair. A few days after being advised that our move in date was postponed AGAIN I received a call on 6/15/16 at 11:05 AM and was advised by Claudia Moreno that they decided that they were going to sell the property, I was fine with it because Claudia advised me that they would have another 3 bedroom 2 bathroom available on 7/15/16. I told her  I would speak with my husband just to be sure. I called back at 11:33 AM on June 15th and was on the phone for about 2 minutes with Mrs. Moreno. I advised her that I would like her to apply our down payment towards that property. I recall asking her about the floors and she advised me that most of their properties have vinyl I asked her the year 1998, and the square feet 1152 sq ft and I asked her if she had pictures(multiple times) and she said that she would email them to me. ( never did) but she did advise that she would reapply my down payment. Today on 7/1/16 my husband called in to see if we were still able to move in right on 7/15/16 and she says that I never called back so she sold the property. That's complete bull. So I called Mrs. Moreno and advised her that I have in my phone records that I did indeed speak with her. Mrs. Moreno continued to speak over me and state that she never spoke with me. I told her I had a conversation with someone that was pretending to be her then. I cannot make up phone records. I have proof. But apparently I had a full on conversation with myself at this number. Now me my husband and my son who is 4 months are homeless. This is such an awful thing to do to someone. If you don't want them living on your property then you should tell them that so they can at least have somewhere to live. And by the way do not leave a voicemail because they don't return calls."
4,5,"I could not be more pleased with the customer support I received from APR RV. We also had a dual tire blow out on our 5th wheel which caused significant damage to the RV and down Jack equipment. Cindy, the service manager was extremely helpful with explaining the repair process and basically how the process works with insurance claims. She really cares and I quickly realized I could trust her advice. Although these experiences are stressful and inconvenient, she went out of her way to make my problem hers. Big THANK YOU to Cindy and the entire team at APR RV. You're the best. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE APR RV TEAM."
4,5,"We started going to APR in 2009 because they were the only one I could find to handle our issue at that time on our Class A coach.  The work has always been great and we have been bringing it in every winter since 2009 after a summer on the road.  Oil changes, generator service, AC work, cabinet work, upholstery, exterior paint and dents, nicks or scratches, they take care of it all.  We usually have a window or two fixed each year to remove the internal fogging that seems to plague all coaches over time.  We just bring itin and say call us when it's done.  Always taken care of with a smile."
4,5,"I found this company after concerns with the previous shop I chose. APR is far away from my residence, however I am glad I chose them. APR did an excellent job repairing my Toy Hauler. They got me in immediately, and they kept me informed about the repair process throughout, till completion. I received email updates and pictures of the repairs. Mine was an insurance claim. APR RV was very professional throughout my repair.  The rep asked if I needed my Hauler back by a certain date, which I did not. The repairs were made quickly and they dealt directly with my adjuster. I highly recommend this company for your RV repairs. One downfall, bring cash, cashiers check, money order, or personal check when making payment.  Their credit card usage fee is high, however they told me upfront. This is a very honest and professional business. Hope my review helps someone."
4,5,"I recently had a blowout on my Motorhome and it destroyed the Grey tank, fender and shower p-trap along with many other issues. APR was the only one that would even consider talking to me as I needed everything fixed in less than 2 weeks because I had a trip planned to UT. They not only accepted the work and started the second I dropped off the Motorhome but they also worked with my insurance company to make sure everything was accomplished as fast as possible. Their customer service was AMAZING!! They kept me up to date with everything that was going on and made sure I understood everything. APR has gained a customer for life. Don't take your RV anywhere else for repairs. Great service, friendly and great work!!"
4,1,"My 5th wheel roof was replaced January 2015 by APR RV (aka Arizona RV Specialist) with the Rhino Eco-Coat and APR said it had a lifetime warranty.  In September 2018 the Eco-Coat started peeling back and exposed wood.  They initially said they would repair it using their current product since they no longer are a representative for Eco-Coat.  Before I took it in as scheduled, they called to say they would not touch the roof and that I should contact Rhino.  Rhino did not issue the lifetime warranty, they did.  Now what???  Is a lifetime less than 4 years???"
4,3,"We are over the moon happy with our new roof ! Even though it took 9 days to get it done instead of the advertised 3 days. They experienced a problem with their supply chain and the essential material did not arrive , not to mention unseasonable hail and cold weather  BUT APR RV took good care of us. Footing the hotel bill for the additional 7 nights we needed to stay , giving us gift certificates for local restaurants. They  were very concerned with all the little details and did their best to make sure that they had delivered  an excellent product. Thanks to Cindy and all the guys in the back for making it happen."
4.5,4,"Our family joined the JCC 2 months ago. After having spent 10 years at a YMCA, followed by 7 years at a higher end gym as a comparison, this is what we've found:

This center is very family friendly. Like the Y, the focus is on fitness, not what you're wearing. Our kids have enjoyed their introductory orientation, and the flexibility to use the facilities at an age 3 years younger compared to our former gym. Family here is a priority.

The sports trainers are very knowledgeable and have your best interests in mind. We were very pleased to work with a corrective exercise specialist who listened to each member of our family and provided a thoughtful appropriate workout to each of our needs. We so appreciated the thoughtful service, which isn't ""based on a sell.""

Great class instructors who know their specialty. So far, I've only taken yoga and tai chi classes, and am pleased that the individuals they hire are experienced and able to work with a wide-ranging demographic of ages and abilities.

Facilities are clean and well-maintained.

Aquatics: As a swimmer with a changing work schedule, I appreciate the available swim hours and the pool temperature!

Positive atmosphere: The J keeps a board welcoming members to ""say something nice."" That says it all.

Welcoming environment: Like the YMCA, people of all backgrounds and religious faiths are welcome."
4.5,4,"Excellent equipment and staff.  I really enjoy this gym, which has all the perks of lifetime and urban active yet has a sense of community.  I only wish their weekend hours were better."
4.5,5,"When I was deciding which gym to attend, I went to 3 different places in the Beachwood area. LA Fitness was too intimidating, LifeTime Fitness was too expensive. The JCC is great, clean, and I don't feel pressure during my workout from anyone but myself. The atmosphere is very different in the mornings vs. the evenings (older vs. younger) but I like both crowds.

When you sign up, you get two free sessions with a personal trainer in order to go over the machines, and help you manage your fitness goals. They also offer a bunch of other free trials for different classes and aquatics.

I use their AMT's, ellipticals, stair mills, rowing machines and general strength equipment. I will try the classes and the pool as well.

Tip: If you go to the gym in the evenings, you might want to bring your own face towel, since they can run out later in the day. In the morning there is no need to bring your own."
4.5,5,My son did preschool here.  Good experience.  He does winter and summer camps there now.  Nice facility.  Friendly people
4.5,5,"I like the atmosphere here and the yoga classes are great.  Nice pool, great hours, good swimming lessons too."
4.5,5,"This is an amazing facility!  They have done many renovations and everything looks brand new.  Their hours were changed from the previous post and are very accommodating.  I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness and services offered.  Tons of classes, great equipment, tv's in the cardio equipment, well-kept locker rooms, and plenty of extra amenities such as sauna and steam rooms, manicures and pedicures, and massages!  I found the price extremely reasonable for all they offer.  Naomi gave me a great tour-ask for her and you will want to sign up too!"
4.5,5,"The Mandel JCC is easily the nicest, most welcoming, and most lavishly equipped gym to which I have ever belonged. Since joining (about 9 months ago) I find that I look forward to my semi-weekly workouts more than usual! I look forward to remaining a member here for as long as I live on the East Side!

I really enjoy the friendly, welcoming environment of the JCC, which is far above and beyond most gyms in my experience. 

The staff also keeps the facilities absolutely spotless and clean - a fundamental asset for a fitness center!

The JCC also offers some niceties that many gyms do not: your membership includes access to the pool, sauna, steam room, and whirlpool, which I try to make time for as often as possible. It's a real added value!

Though I am not much one for group fitness classes, they are abundant here. If it is your thing, you'll be well covered!"
4.5,1,Very rude customer service. I've been a resident of Shaker Heights/Beachwood for 20 years and I was treated very poorly by one of the newer faces at JCC front desk. I came in to try a guest pass after being in between local gyms in the area. I've been a member of the facility previously over the span of 7 years and never complained until today. I was so ready to sign up that is until the lady at the front desk told me that I couldn't. She explained that since I used a guest pass last year that I was not eligible to sign up for an additional pass. Now I understood her clearly however she was completely RUDE AND DISMISSIVE towards me! I never used the guest pass because my sister signed me up (Who had been a member forever) but I never physically came into the gym to workout. I explained that I didn't even have an opportunity to see if he gym was a place I wanted to join once again. I asked her how much time before I was eligible for another pass and again she was very blunt and dismissive! She keep repeating herself EVERY 18 MONTHS! She then asked if I wanted to try to facility so bad then to buy a $15 guest pass for one day which is beyond stupid! I guess I'll keep my other membership for the time being.  I guess since I don't fit the description for the more frequent guest at this facility that I was not any shown leniency. Not happy about this at all.
4.5,5,"Excellent facilities, valuable programs - fitness and cultural, good instructors, and the customer service has improved tremendously.   The JCC is a staple of the Cleveland-area."
4.5,5,"Love this place - great fitness center 
Plenty to pamper your body 
Yoga, Pilates, free classes including Zumba, gym, track, machines galore, weights, racquetball courts, pool, hot tubs, steam, sauna, massage, manicures & pedicures.
Tomorrow going to use the racquet ball courts! Can't wait!"
4.5,5,"Y'all pregnant mamas: this place offers the best prenatal yoga on the east side! Before I signed up, I investigated all yoga studios, including places that's not yoga studio but offer prenatal yoga. Think hospital, ""wellness center"", counseling center, etc.

I'm careful about selecting yoga instructor in general. What qualification does one need to start teaching prenatal yoga? I don't think there's any regulation. 

- Instructor quality:
The prenatal yoga instructor here, Eleanor, has the most comprehensive background - Master's Degree from The Ohio State University in Somatic Education, which is the study of movement from holistic perspective. And of course a certified yoga instructor. She said prenatal yoga is her favorite class to teach all week, because yoga helped her so much during her own pregnancy.

- Cost:
You don't need JCC membership to take the class. Just pay a bit more than regular members. The cost per class is $12 for non-members, comparable to regular classes at nearby yoga studios. 

Religious affiliation is not required to work out here. No one is preaching in your ears while exercising.

Friendly staff. 

- Environment:
They've got big windows everywhere that put me in a good mood thinking about coming here. This is very important. In the past I've worked out in gym which doesn't have any exterior window. I found it depressing to stay in a space like that for the long term. Work out is an activity that needs motivation already. Gyms should remove any mental friction that gets in the way of it.

- I'm glad JCC offers this class to the general public and I sure hope they continue to do so."
4.5,5,"I gotta say. I really love this place. The machines are state of art. The staff is very friendly. I agree, this club is a best kept secrete."
4.5,5,"I love the JCC. It's a well kept secret, at least on yelp :-)

Pros: Awesome pool, great classes which are included, nice aerobic equipment, 2 raquetball courts, tons of trainers, relaxed atmosphere, kosher Subway, (smallish) indoor track, really nice people, low traffic at night.

Cons: Some hours which are inconvenient, older free weight room, some gender restrictions.

I'll address the cons. Basically, this is a Jewish community center, which caters to orthodox and non-orthodox jews. However, you don't have to be Jewish to go there (I'm not). As such, the facility closes at 5 on Friday, but the way I look at it, I'm not working out then anyway, I'm relaxing and/or having a cold one. The other thing is that there are certain parts of the gym that are women only and certain times the pool is men only or women only. This is because of orthodox tradition. As long as you know the schedule, it isn't a problem at all. As for the free weight room, the stuff is a little older, but it's just free weights. As long as they WEIGH the right amount and don't fall on me, I'm happy. 

Now onto my favorite parts. The cost is the lowest I found, I pay roughly 30 per person per month because they let me and my girlfriend join as a couple (take THAT you stuffy catholic community centers! j/k). Additionally, this is only a year contract instead of 3 AND I'm not paying to have the latest and greatest exercise equipment around (It really hasn't changed that much folks, just work up a sweat somehow...). Best of all, since it's laid back there aren't a ton of gym rats giving you the stink eye when you're using their favorite machine nor is there 2 year old sweat caked on the machines (I'm looking at you Bally's). 

Anyway, great place and I'm glad I joined there. If you're on the east side, I'd highly recommend it."
4.5,5,"This facility is HUGE!! 

Do you want to play racquetball? Shake it at Zumba? Swim some laps in the Olympic pool? Chill in the hot tub? You name it, they've got it.

The locker rooms are spotless (bring your own shampoo/conditioner for showers) and they provide towel service.

The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I mostly use the pool and hit the steam room after. Pool can get crowded in the evenings because there are some lessons for all ages (which is a good thing) but they keep a lane or two free for those of us trying to get in our laps. 

After you've sweated and earned your dinner head on over to the INDOOR Subway!! Yes, you can grab a footlong sub after your workout without leaving the building. Score!"
4.5,2,"While the JCC is a clean and very nice facility to workout in, their customer service is certainly not up to par. Having worked for many years in the fitness industry, the Mandel JCC lacks in caring about their members, and providing them with the best service possible. They claim to be the #1 gym in Ohio, but they do not act like it. 

Here is why:

6 months ago, I purchased personal training sessions for my parents to use. My parents reached out to trainers, fitness managers, and general managers, trying to schedule something. No one ever returned their calls. I then more recently reached out to their fitness manager, and general manager, and once again, no one returned calls, and no one was ever there to help. It's just unacceptable. Personal trainers along with fitness managers, should reach out to members within 24 hours. There is no excuse not to. 

My family had plans to refer other members, and to purchase more sessions, and now their trust in the JCC is lost. It's really sad. The gym is a nice facility, and offers many up to date amenities and equipment, though it does lack in allowing people to use the TRX, and it needs updated foam rollers. 

But for the price, I suppose its worth it, but don't expect quality customer service."
4.5,5,"Going to this gym for over a year has made me downright spoiled. You walk in and are greeted by friendly security staff (and on some mornings, fresh baked challah for sale). Each member gets their own membership card and scans in ensuring that the facility is safe and secure.

The gym floor itself is extensive, with a variety of weight machines, free weights, and cardio equipment. The equipment is very up to date, especially many of the cardio machines which feature touch screen controls, Netflix + Hulu compatibility, and a log-in system so you can keep track of your progress. Also the group fitness classes are great! Aside from very few exceptions, they are complementary with the membership and hold up to classes that I've paid big bucks for.

After a workout the retreat to the locker room is always welcoming. Inside, you've got your standard lockers, showers, and vanities, plus some fancier features like a sauna, a steam room. There has never been a day when I was disappointed with the cleanliness of their facilities.

While all these features make this gym a great place to work out, I'd say the community within it makes it a truly 5-star experience. The members are courteous of each other, always cleaning up after themselves and treating each other with respect. This, and the hardworking, welcoming staff, make the JCC the place to be."
4.5,4,"I really loved this gym when I was a member, the major downside for me were the hours.

Weekends close at 6PM.  That was always tough when I wanted to take the family out for a workout weekend.

I like the pool.  Fits all ages & sizes, although I would like a 12 foot deep end (their's goes to about 5-7 feet deep.

They have great competitions, including the Indoor Triathlon.  That was really fun, and low stress."
4,5,We had such a great experience with Elite RV. They were very easy to work with and the rental process to the return process was very simple. The RV was clean and we never questioned how it ran. It did a great job and we took it far enough to know it was reliable!! We will definitely be recommending your company to friends and family and will travel with you guys again. Thank you for being available while we were on the road!!
4,5,"The RV we rented from Elite RV Rentals was just as expected: clean, well-functioning, and spacious. Nathan--the manager in charge of Elite RV--was amazing. Before we drove off with our rented RV, he gave us a thorough walkthrough to make sure we understood how to operate it. And, when we needed his help during our trip, he was always available to answer any follow-up questions. The entire experience was very pleasant and we would definitely rent from Elite RV Rentals again!"
4,5,I highly recommend Elite RV Rentals they have clean units and prices are the best I've come across anywhere they take great pride in their customers we will definitely keep them as our go to RV rental
4,5,"My friend and I did a girls trip to Sedona, horseshoe bend and antipope canyon. We wanted to be able to rest where ever we wanted without being confined to a hotel in one of the city's. We looked around for the best price and RV we could get and safely drive. I called a few other places who weren't very helpful and didn't seem to care about what we were looking for But when I called Elite RV rentals, Nathan was extremely helpful in explaining what to expect and what would work best so we went down to the lot and he walked us thru and found us an 29ft sunseeker class c motorhome. Walked use through the RV. Shower is everything and made sure it was something we were comfortable with. Is was clean, comfortable and easy to drive. It made our girls trip even better."
4,5,I highly recommend Elite RV. Thanks Elite RV for making our country thunder trip Awesome. Nathan was available to help with any needs that we had the whole trip. We will be using you guys again next year for sure!
4,5,I can't say enough of good things about Elite RV -- friendly and professional.  Nathan did a thorough checkout and the return was just as easy.  Great rental prices and no fuss cleaning was super -- highly recommended.
4,1,"The unit we rented from Elite should not have been rented without some maintenance. It was a 2016 Leprechaun. Problems......awning broke when we got it home (was repaired by Elite however we still had issues with it and never used it), heater didn't work (and we needed it), kitchen faucet handle would not turn and no plugs to do dishes, batteries would not hold a charge etc. When talking with Elite about the issues we were told they wish we had told them about the batteries and they would have replaced them.  We were 5 hrs away without cell service. The only thing they were concerned about was the batteries. In their defense they did give us a $200 back and a $100 credit towards a future rental which we will never use. Just beware when renting with them."
4,1,"I recommend go elsewhere, dirty RV & in need of repairs."
4,1,"They look good on paper & at a good price. Just remember, you get what you pay for. Then you put a deposit & go down to pick up the RV. It's a lot shared with a junkyard or storage junk lot.
 As soon as you arrive, you know you made a mistake. If your rental is clean it's only because the last people bought it back that way.
 Usually they come back & go out the next day with nothing done. prep fee is just money in their pocket. You already paid a deposit so you are screwed & not getting it back.. A fast walk around & you are out of there. 
So many things are broken or don't work but it's a cheap rental & that's what you paid for. The sewage tanks may be full or the RV is out of gas but that's how it came back. Then there's Nathen. He Will tell you what you want to hear & then do nothing. He's Like a cheap used car salesman that will say anything to make the sale. .Bring it back with any damage & you better expect to lose your  $500 deposit. He won't use it to make repairs, it will just go in his pocket & out it goes again for the next renter to complain about. If you want a great vacation , I would recommend paying a couple extra dollars & go elsewhere. You will thank yourself!"
5,5,"Mark & Mike are very professional handle customers with respect. 

We were given an estimate for a comprehensive suspension upgrade. There work was done on time and the quality exceeded expectations. 

The cost came in less than the estimate. 

Our vehicle performs better than ever. 

We highly recommend them for any of their work."
5,5,"Took my 5th wheel to have bearings packed.  They went over and above our expectations, and was 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than other quotes.  Very knowledgable and honest."
5,5,"Came in today for some help setting up my weight distributing hitch.  Not only did they take time to set me up properly and give me some pointers, they wouldn't take any money from me.  They have earned my future business.  Good group of guys.  Thank you."
5,5,"We were traveling through southern Arizona when the leaf springs failed for the third time, so we spent a few extra days researching ways to eliminate the problem. We decided to go with heavier springs and to install air bags. Then we went looking for a reputable suspension supplier and found Straight Line Suspension. Marc Knutson took our call and knew what we really needed. He seriously upgraded the leaf springs as well as he had a better suggestion instead of air bags he recommended a different type of support. If you want more information call them!!"
5,5,"I took my RV in to Straightline Suspension to get a suspension overhaul.
Not only were they 15% less expensive than other quotes but when I picked up the motor home, they stuck to the quote and didn't charge me a penny more (not my experience working with auto shops of any kind).

The work was don't proper and very fast.
These guys know how to treat customers!!
A++"
5,5,"These guys Mike and Marc are true professionals and do superior work. I towed my 18,000 lbs toyhauler trailer on 2 of the three axles all the way from Southern California to the shop in Mesa, Arizona. My third axle had busted a leaf spring and was torn out from under the trailer while towing. I researched the issue for a couple weeks and figured out that the suspension assemblies on these big trailers are extremely light-duty junk! I researched shops and heard good things about Straightline. I showed up before their starting hours on a Monday morning and they took me right in. They further explained to me all the components of my junk suspension and had all the heavy duty components on hand to show me the difference. 

I had them change out all 6 leaf springs, cut and re-weld 4 sets of suspension mounting brackets, install a complete heavy duty set of equalizer components, replace my third axle and do an alignment on all three axles. They also went above and beyond and welded 2""x1"" metal stabilizer bars from side to side connecting and strengthening each axles mounting bracket. 

I was in no hurry to get my trailer back and they still turned it around in a day. Best part is they were very, very, very reasonanle. I can't say enough good things about my experience, they have a perfect shop with everything you could ever need on hand ready to go. They are extremely knowledgeable and very high quality. I will recommend these guys to everyone!!!!!!"
5,5,"It's been 2 months and 2,000 miles since Mike and Mark upgraded my suspension.

I have a 32' gas motorhome on the Ford F-53 chassis. It rode exactly like the delivery truck the chassis was built for. After doing research, I decided to upgrade the shocks to Koni all around and Sumo springs as well. Mike talked me out of spending the extra approximately$1,200 for the front and convinced me that I only needed the rears.

When was the last time YOU had a repair shop do that?!?!

Well, after driving up to Flagstaff, Grand Canyon, Canyon de Chelly, Monument Valley, Zion, Bryce and back to Tucson over a variety of roads, elevations and wind conditions.... It's time to give Straight Line their due.

My motorhome's ride will never be mistaken for a Cadillac but it's 100% better. No more white knuckle days with gusting winds or 5 and 6% downhill grades.

As a bonus, they referred me to Redburn Tire where I got 6 new tires and about 30 minutes of tire maintenance instructions that was extremely helpful.

If I could, I'd give Straight Line 6 stars"
5,5,"Great service from Mike today (Saturday). If you need something for your trailer, they have it. I was looking for new hubs to convert my 1998 camping trailer from 5 x 4.5 to 6 x 5.5. Straight Line had the parts.  He was very informative and it shows that they care about their customers. I will be back."
5,5,"Thank you Straight Line! Saved our trip with a quick, friendly repair of our travel trailer."
4,5,Our neighbor had purchased out of state from always R.V. and expressed how satisfied they were so the wife and i thought we would give them a shot.This was truly a great experience. Everybody was friendly & informative and we appreciated the shuttle from the airport. The service was great and our sales process with Patty was awesome. 5-Stars.
4,5,"We were very pleased with Always RV's crew of Patty, Mona, and the technician guy from Iowa (sorry, can't remember his name) who all dealt with us quickly, thoroughly, and honestly. 

We found a trailer via RV Trader and quickly received an answer to our query, plus someone was always available to answer our phone calls. Patty gave us a fair quote and since we had to drive 140 miles to view the trailer, had it ready up front for our inspection. We purchased the trailer and we were pleased with all of the service we received from the entire crew. Yesterday we picked it up and the gang made sure everything was working before we left the lot. Plus Patty made sure we took homemade cookies for our return trip home. We wouldn't hesitate to return to Always RV if we ever needed another RV; however, this is supposed to be our ""forever"" trailer so we most likely won't return--at least that's the plan."
4,1,"Disappointed with this company after a clear bait and switch practice.  Patty, one of the sales agents, failed to make an appointment I set.  I was shuffled between three other representatives as I test drove two motor homes.   After striking a deal with one of them, Patty then objected after hands were shaken.


Brief update, Sahara RV in Las Vegas took the trade for the value originally offered and they sold it in less than 60 days for $15,800.   Bait and switch warning!!"
4,5,"They are great!  We are so pleased with their quality of service because they actually went above and beyond our expectations.  We wanted to buy a 2005 Gulf Stream Endura but there was a vibration issue at highway speed.  They ended up replacing ALL 6 tires with a good brand and actually sent the motorhome to a suspension shop to make sure there were no other issues.  My husband is extremely happy with how well it rides now!

Upon pickup we found out that they did more than we asked for by finding an issue and replacing the radio/CD player because it wasn't ejecting CD's.  We also contracted them to install a rear ladder.  Later we found out because of the coach's design it needed to be ordered straight from the manufacturer.  I am sure this was at a much greater expense than expected.  

My husband and I absolutely love the coach and have already recommended Always RV to several friends and would positively do business with them again in the future.

Patti and Dave are an awesome team!"
4,4,"Very pleasant experience. Trades in our elderly motor home for a newer toy house. They cleaned up our purchase, put on new tires, and included new hoses and such. We were overall satisfied with doing business here."
4,5,"Best rv Dealer in Arizona.
what a breath of fresh air to deal with people that are Honest and are looking out for the customer .
They are doing Warranty work on my trailer and the manufacture sent the wrong parts . they could have put them in and collected the money and I would have never known. 
But ALWAYS RV in Mesa where looking out for me and told the manufacture that they got the wrong parts and need the right ones to make it right for ME The customer. 
I will never take my trailer anywhere else but ALWAYS RV IN MESA . thank you for looking out for me not just the $"
4,1,By far the worst experience I've ever had dealing with any professional business.  We wrote a check and then were told we had to write another 8000$ check to get the RV promised by several representatives and were barely able to get the keys to our RV back to leave. This place is a rip off.  Be aware.  These people are trying to steal your money.
4,4,"I wanted to give this place one star at the beginning but have to give it four now and here is why. We needed to purchase a toy hauler for an elk hunt. We needed it fast! They were prompt with their service, even staying after hours to make sure everything was taken care of. Well, their trailer tech must have been in a just a big of hurry because when we drove it home (3.5 hr trip) we had a blowout and several other issues with tires. Come to find out the bearings were a mess. Had to get them all redone. Total repairs almost $1000. Then took it hunting and had a couple other minor issues. Called Always RV when we returned and they told us they'd fix our problem and that the tech was now gone from the company (idk why). Came and got our trailer, fixed it promptly in time for another hunt, and reimbursed us for the money we lost. Thank you Always RV for being a stand up and doing fair business! Thanks Dave Matson!"
5,5,"Started to shop for a new toy hauler throughout the state and quickly ended up at Rowley White. A sells associate, Zach, led us around the lot showing us units that met our criteria. He ensured that we knew what features and options were available and that we were getting everything we wanted and kept our budget and needs in mind. We left with the perfect toy hauler for an incredible price. I highly recommend the McDowell ave store, but as we looked at units on their other Phoenix metro lots, all of their staff was very helpful."
5,5,"Wow. Great customer service and great group of people with honest prices that just want to sell a food rv. We got a great deal, like all people who buy from Rowley white! Don't buy anywhere else."
5,5,"This place is hands down the best place to buy a new trailer.  We had been shopping around for a little while and stopped at a few other places before we ended up at Rowley White. This place stands far apart from the others. There was no high pressure sales, service was amazing. Jed was SO knowledgeable and friendly and helpful. The prices at Rowley white are what you see, which cuts the frustrating sale price game playing out of the picture- AWESOME!!!! We paid far less for our wonderful brand new trailer than we would anywhere else for anything a couple years used.  The follow up service is top notch."
5,5,Had some hiccups with our transaction but they made everything right. Will definitely be doing business again in the future.
5,5,Bought a new Toy Hauler from David at Rowley White on Cave Creek Rd. Had the pleasure of using it twice and last weekend on the third try my vehicle broke down while pulling it from Sedona to Flagstaff. After finding out my AAA Premier membership did not cover the trailer I called David my sales guy. He immediately put me in contact with the Flagstaff office and arranged them to receive it and store it until I could make arrangements to get it back to Phoenix. Because it is Flag and colder they drained all tanks and winterized it. Picked it up a week later and got it back home. NO CHARGE!! Just great service from great people. A shout out to David and Steve in Flagstaff office. Appreciate all you did!!
5,5,"I dunno.  Five, eight years?  I've been dreaming about getting an RV and thumbing my nose at the corporate world, losing myself somewhere in America.  Research, CraigsList Ads,RV Shows, RV Forums, more free hotdogs than I want to count.  More ""gotta have it now"" deals, but only if I buy now! that I care to discuss.

I finally got serious this last year and narrowed down the size/type that I wanted.  I purchased a truck last year to pull my new ToyHauler.  I researched local dealers and prices for the make/models I was interested in.  Hands-down the best advertised prices I could find was at Rowley White.  There are no add-ons like ""dealer prep"".  You pay the taxes and registration.

The wife and I finally bit the bullet and visited the lot in Cave Creek.  It was here we met a young man named Jed Bredsguard.  Jed knows his shit.  having immersed myself in RVs for so long, I had a pretty good idea of how they work.  So does Jed.  He showed us a variety of RV's that we liked.  He was easygoing and personable, he answered a myriad of questions.  We told him we wanted to check the other RW lots - way out in Mesa and downtown.  This is usually code for ""we are not buying today, but thank you very much"".  Not today, we would be buying somewhere by the end of the day.  Jed took it in stride, and recommended who we should talk to at the other lot.  Two hours later, we were back to see Jed with the search narrowed down to three.  Thirty more minutes and we were talking prices.

Amazingly, still no pressure.  In fact, Jed sweetened the deal by tossing in some accessories.  We dropped the deposit that day.  Last week the accessories came in and I took the trailer back to the shop - I needed a quick turnaround as I had a big trip scheduled with my off-road group.   Once again, with a smile, Jed and RW came through for me.  I am so impressed with this organization, everyone has been polite and helpful and just made the experience that much more cool.

If you are in the market for an RV trailer, I would very much recommend taking a look at their inventory and comparing it to others.  You will not be disappointed.  Ask for Jed, you won't be disappointed with him either.

Thanks again Jed, and RW - you've made me a very happy camper!"
4,5,Looking for a family-oriented place to take the kiddos for Fall activities and Pumpkin picking?  Go here.  This place is great.  $7.00 will get you a wristband good for more than 15 fun activities on their grounds.  The scavenger hunt is the best.  We thought it would be so easy but some of the items were hard to find...and that made it so fun!  Great destination!
4,4,"We drove from DC to Ohio this weekend to hike in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park with friends. My friend called the national park to book a campsite for us and since they were all booked for Memorial Day weekend the park referred us to the farm. It was a little difficult to get our stuff to the campsite from our car because we couldn't back our car into our camp site and we didn't have our own fire pit. However, all in all the Christmas tree farm was beautiful in the light of day and the owners of the farm were very generous enough to let us sit on their porch and play games during the crazy thunderstorm. It was a great bounding experience."
4,3,"I'm reviewing based on my experience of the fall festival for toddlers.

Compared to Patterson's fall festival, Heritage is more expensive and a lot less of things to do for a toddler. We didni't go on the scavanger's hunt, but I imagine it would be more fun for adults and older kids.

Heritage's hayride is longer. It takes you on sort of a tour around the farm, cruising through the Christmas tree, woods, and camp ground. 

The most fun my tot had at Heritage is its corn pit (like a sand pit). 

There are two Heritage Farms in Ohio with same name. So make sure you have the right address.

There was pumpkin rolling down a super deep hill (for toddlers). There was only one slide. 

The Straw tunnel is very minimalistic ....and too dark. No comparison with Patterson's straw playground.

So if the two farms are equal distance to you, and you have young children, go to Patterson."
4,5,"Camp away in Peninsula, OH!  This Christmas Tree Farm has several sites you can rent for a very reasonable fee. Some even have a basic wooden shelter available if you don't like tent camping. (Think Yurt) They provide a nice fire pit at each site and even wood for you to use. 
Owners are friendly and helpful. This helps supplement the farm in the summer months. There are some nice hiking trails right on the property, but you are within walking distance from the Towpath and several CVNP trailheads. 
We like to really rough it) and go into Peninsula for breakfast at Fisher's Tavern every morning. Winking Lizard is also very close. 
Every Memorial Day weekend they celebrate ""Fairy Days"". It's a quaint little festival on the premises that any little girl, (and to tell the truth most big girls) would love. A small entrance fee gets you a day of dancing in the Fairy ring, finding your fairy name, building a fairy house, searching for hidden fairies, browsing the fairy market, planting a fairy garden, and visiting the fairy post office. It's so charming and well done. They sell burgers and dogs on premises. I told all my friends with kids about it!  
I love this place. We have camped here two years for a weekend hiking trip and enjoy their hospitality. Port a Johns are available but no shower facilities. I am even inspired to try a real tree this year for Christmas. You are surrounded by them at the campsites. We heard coyotes and owls at night. Enjoyed the beautiful scent of Honeysuckle on the trail and were able to get away from it all. Reservations can be made online but they appeared to get quite a few drive up rentals as well."
2,1,"Absolutely the most disgusting RV I have ever seen. The generator didn't work, the fridge was broken, there were piles of dog hair everywhere, and the seats which are the beds, were so stained and full of grime that you had to wash your hands if you touched it."
2,1,"Rented me a broken down piece of trash and then had a bad attitude when I turned it back in. The toilet shot water out the front, the roof leaked, the frig was broken, the grey water tanks leaked and a bench seat was broken. Their response was that it had been winterized."
2,5,"The guy who works there is amazing, he took great care of my group, above and beyond expectations. Best Cruise America location I've been to yet!"
2,2,"We had great luck the first time we rented an RV from this location but we didn't the 2nd time. The RV smelled like a wet dog and there was dog hair everywhere, including the stove.  It was so bad that after spending $1650 for a week for the RV we had to rent cabins for 5 nights at the KOA because we couldn't sleep in the RV.  When returning the vehicle the associate acknowledged the problem and said he knew one was bad but didn't realize we got it.  He said they tried to remove he smell but were unsuccessful.  I explained the additional expense of having to rent cabins (didn't mention all of the air fresheners and fabreeze we bought) and he offered a $100 credit (cabins were $50 x 2 x 5 nights + tax = $550).  No empathy, no apology, just a $100 credit.  I won't rent from here again because I can't risk ruining my family's vacation.  I'll pay more next time to rent from a reputable location.  And I'll know next time to verify that the RV is clean and doesn't smell like an animal."
3,5,"I was very pleased with the service and friendliness of the service writer Jimmy Ainsworth, and WW Williams. We had a bad oil leak at the sending unit on a Mercedes engine in a Freightliner. We had heard of so many bad reviews at the other dealerships, we were apprehensive getting any work done in Vegas, but we had to!. Not only was I able to get in the same day, they evaluated the problem, told me they could have the part out of Reno the next morning and have it ready by afternoon. Jimmy called me as promised, had us back on the road and....... the shipping of the part was less than quoted, so I saved about $40.00 that I would never have known about, in shipping. They found a small water leak at the compressor but was told it would make it back to Phoenix, which it did and we repaired it at home. My overall experience was way more than expected, and they were up front, honest and my truck was cleaned when I arrived, never knowing I would have had an oil leak. Many Thanks to WW Williams, we will be back.

3,1,Don't even try !!!!Group of liars..quoted over the phone one price when arrived they tripled the price very slow in organizing .try to avoid them in any price !
3,5,A good experience from start to finish. Straightforward quality mechanics and everyone we spoke to on the phone couldn't of been nicer. The technician was on time got the job done quickly and really knew what he was doing. He replaced our driveshaft in a diesel pusher in less than an hour. Would highly recommend
3,1,"Terrible shop, terrible employees, and even worse management.
Good luck trying to get an honest person to talk to, because there isn't one in this entire organization.
And the teenagers in the shop don't care if they burn through you're money by using too many hours... they sure know how to throw parts though.
Ridiculous, worthless business.
Save yourself a lot of money, and a headache.... go somewhere else."
4,2,"Jared Munk our Salesman was great! Very personable and helpful in finding  the right RV for our family. We had such a good rapport with Jared. 
When we went in to sign the paperwork, we were assisted by Denny. I found him to be way to pushy about us putting  deposit.  They advertise ""we will not be undersold"" but when we showed them the exact same RV, we were told that they would only ""split the difference"".  I was very dissapointed  but we went through with the purchase anyway. ( kids were already in love with the trailer).
 Paperwork signed, we set a date to have the towing gear installed on our vehicle. We were planning on taking our new trailer to California for Christmas. 
When we arrived for installation we were told that the part we needed had to be ordered and would take a couple of days. When the necessary part arrived, my husband spoke directly with the supervisor and advised him very specifically about the placement of the brake control. We arrived to find that our wishes were not respected. Holes were drilled into my car and the brake control was not placed where we wanted it. There was an apology and the holes were filled in. You cant see the holes, but I know they are there. Since Dec 2014 no one from Johnnie Walker has followed up with us. 
My husband wanted to buy from them because a co worker of his had nothing but excellent things to say about this company.

Jared and the women who took care of the financials were the only good thing about our dealings with Johnnie Walker."
4,5,"We had a great experience with Johnnie Walker RV. About 8 months ago we stopped by to look with no intent on buying. We were approached by Steve and we told him that we were not looking to buy. With this info, he still spent an hour with us and was awesome. A couple weeks ago we went back and talked with Steve again. We had a bad experience at BlueDog and came back here. Steve helped us find a great RV and within a few days we were driving home with it. Steve was great and even took us to the other Johnnie Walker lot to look at RVs that fit our needs. I would recommend talking to Steve if you want an RV."
4,4,I'm editing my review because Ken at Johnny Walker RV has contacted me and really showed is that they care and will help with any problems. Thank you guys and I'm looking forward to getting this issue resolved with you
4,5,"You think buying a car is a pain? Try buying a travel trailer! The good news is that owning a travel trailer is way more fun that owning a car, and if I would have found Johnnie Walker sooner, the process would have actually been painless.

Drinking wine around a campfire while my kids cook hot dogs over a flame was the extent of my camping skills 3 years ago, barely. I have really enjoyed taking my boys to KOA's where I could rent a cabin for $150+ a night and actually try and learn some camping skills in comfort. Since the last time I camped in an actual tent was about 30 years ago, when my dad did all the work, I felt that a cabin with running water, electricity and a bathroom was a more appropriate choice for me and my boys. And probably the safer choice since I had no idea when it was a good time or a bad time to hang your food in tree's so bears do not get them or us. 

My wife hates camping. Wanted to mention that.

Anyways, I have been admiring RV's from afar these past few years. Me and my boys would walk around at gaze in amazement at these cabins on wheels. On a trip this summer to a KOA in Utah, we saw an incredible RV and I had to have it. After doing some research, I realized that that particular model was priced at around $800k. Um, $800k for an RV is probably not going to work for me right now no matter how much I want a Ritz-Carlton on wheels. But seeing that RV changed me. I knew I had to get the wife onboard with my new RV fascination. 

I forced my wife to come with us to a KOA a few weeks ago and stay in a cabin. I would call it ""glamping"" but that is a stupid word. Surprisingly, she too was interested in all the interesting RV's around the property. She too enjoyed gazing at them in awe. We both were super curious as to how it all worked. What were those tubes? What were those wires? Why did some people have cute and quirky signs like ""Home Is Where My Trailer Is"" posted by their front door? Who were these people! Well, we were going to find out.

If I could offer my wife the comforts of home in a travel trailer, she was totally into it. Who knew that a KOA near the Grand Canyon could convince my wife to camp! Well, kinda camp. Glamp? Ugh, you get the picture.

I went to Camping World first, and boy did they waste my time. I have an Audi Q7 that can tow up to 6,600. If I did not do any research myself, they would have had me in a very dangerous trailer and a dangerous situation. Luckily they had no follow through or I may have made a bad, expensive decision. Next up was Findlay. They did not have what I wanted, in the size I needed. I was suppose to see 4 trailers with them, I ended up only seeing 2. I was frustrated. At this point, 3 weeks had gone by and I wanted a trailer 3 weeks ago! I had done the research and knew what I wanted, but nobody could give it to me. I seriously was about to give up. I drove away from Findlay, and then I saw a Johnnie Walker RV sign and decided just to give it one more shot. I pulled in having no idea who they were. But I knew I liked Johnnie Walker scotch a lot, so how bad could it be.

Well, it was incredible! I met a dapper guy named JJ who did not beat around the bush with me like the others had done, and within 24 hours I had purchased an incredible trailer that worked safely with my car. To say the team here knows their stuff is an understatement. They seriously go above and beyond in every way. Since this was my first trailer, I had countless questions, and Darcy along with JJ would answer my ignorant questions even if it was over the weekend, or at night. When I brought my family in, they treated us all like part of the family. I am not exaggerating.

Allowing me to stay on property overnight after spending time with a tech learning the ropes, was more than priceless. I left this morning with my new trailer behind me feeling 100% confident. 

Do yourself a favor and do not go anywhere else to purchase an RV. Go see JJ and he will take incredible care of you. No joke. Not only did I get an amazing travel trailer at an amazing price, they also throw in all sorts of goodies to get you started! And free overnight stays at locations in NV and UT as well? I'm in!

The experience I had with this business was absolutely incredible. These people CARE about you. These are the people who put ""Welcome"" signs on their RV. These are the people I looked at from afar on my KOA trips and wondered who they were. These are the people I will see hooking up next to me on my next trip. These are my friends. I guess I now need to go buy a sign for my trailer that says, ""Home Is Where My Trailer Is"".

Thank you everyone at Johnnie Walker RV for making my first trailer purchase something truly special."
4,5,Wow the parts department had the best people I could have ever hoped for in helping me with my issue. Walked in there with a picture of my part and the person that helped us got it within an instant second of what I was looking for.  Great service and knowledge first pick now everytime I need a part!
4,4,"Stopped in yesterday to pick up a part for our RV.  But since we had been researching the newer motorhomes, we made time to look at the units on the lot.  

They do have some of those trendy Retro vintage camper trailers, which were fun to check out (saw one at Divas Day Out).  There are also some very space-efficient compact motorhomes, which is what we're considering since it's easy enough for me to maneuver.  For hubby, any size RV is easy.  I'm a little more tentative about driving anything as large as a moving van--I can handle a minivan, no problem.

We were free to roam to our heart's content and when we were interested in speaking with someone, a sales rep came to greet us and to assess what we were looking for.  Mark was very easy going; friendly, straightforward and knowledgeable--he's been with this company for years and confidently answered our questions.  Hubby really liked his manner, too.  Mark also shuttled us in a golf cart in order to show other models on the back lot, new and used.

It was nice to make this connection, even though we're still in the early stages of our search.  When we're ready to purchase, we feel comfortable in coming back here and asking for Mark's assistance."
4,5,"Johnny Walkers is a unique experience. Family owned and super friendly staff!  Angela was exceptional as we toured through the RV's they had on site. Going with the must haves in the RV she showed me my options and gave me pros and cons that I hadnt thought of. I had been to the other RV lots, and didn't care for the high pressure, or lack of presence given to me at the other lots. She helped me find the right trailer for me, and let me take all the time I needed to make my decision. Yes, there were a couple of things that went wrong with the trailer, but the service department fixed everything up, and let me stay on site, in the trailer while they were working on it!!

  Just a note to Douglas S, first of all, if there were specific things you were looking for, why didn't you pass those along, or is the salesman/woman supposed to be psychic?? She tells it like it is and helps the customer find what they are looking for! Its interesting how Angela supposedly told you the plate number of a trailer, as it takes a few weeks to get just the ""green sheet"" to take to the DMV, and sales department would never know what the plate number is. I'm still trying to figure out where the Trump campaign material is! or why it's even an issue?  My guess on why you didn't like Angela as your sales person is because you just don't like an educated, happy bubbly woman, who believes in protecting herself, and her country. I'm going to take an educated guess here, that your the kind of man who insists on people telling you what you want to hear and want everyone to bend over to kiss your ass. I'm quite sure that you wish that our country was like your country, but as long as I have anything to say about it, the United States will continue to have freedoms, the right to bear arms, and freedom of speech!  I'm glad you found someone to hold your hand as you were making your purchase, hope you have a great return trip to Canada.  By the way, stay there, we have enough whinny bags who we have to take care of and deal with here that are U.S. Citizens."
4,5,"""LOVE my 2013 Forest River Wildcat 5th wheel"" - Tony T the mailman 
 


Sometimes i don't make the best monetary decisions when making a LARGE ITEM PURCHASE, thank goodness i went to Johnnie Walker RV !!! They really listened to me, then answered all my questions and concerns WITHOUT the HIGH PRESSURE TO BUY that I was expecting. Their selection is amazing, their knowledge and kindness is TOP SHELF. After ""SCHOOLING"" me, they let me spend 2 nights HOOKED-UP in their lot to LEARN how to RV and become familiar with my 5th Wheel. They even gave me the GATE CODE, so i could come n go as i wanted after hours those 2 nights. WHO DOES THAT?? Thank you very much Johnnie Walker, it feels GREAT to finally make a good decision on a big money purchase! Hi Moose  your friend, Tony T."
4,5,"Mark in sales was excellent. We got good deal on a new 5th wheel and EVERYONE there was nice and helpful. I especially want to call out David in service who walked us thru everything on the RV and handled all the little things which inevitably popped up. He was extremely helpful, friendly, courteous, and polite. Also Allan whom installed our hitch was very helpful and friendly. With all the little things these guys offer it makes the transaction that much better and keeps customers satisfied and likely repeat customers. Thank you everyone at Johnnie Walker RV!"
4,5,We just want to share our great experience with Johnnie Walker RV.   We are very pleased with their sales staff & the finance manager Darcy - she went over & beyond any expectations to make sure that we had the best deal possible when finalizing our paperwork.  We were very pleased with them keeping their word from start to finish.   That's rare these days to find!  We would recommend them to anyone that's looking for an RV and wants great customer service to go see them first!!
4,1,"Decent looking place, and they have some very unusual amenities, such as allowing buyers to spend a coupla nights on the lot in their new RV so that they understand how everything works. Very impressed. 

The ""impressed"" ended there.

The salesperson (Angela) was very bubbly and friendly as we walked to the lot. She began showing us a 5th wheel that she felt we'd like. She hadn't asked a single qualifying question, so she didn't know squat about what we wanted, beyond us wanting a 5th wheel.

So, she showed us a coach. It was a very nice coach, but nothing like what we were looking for. I told her we'd looked a couple of particular Montana models, and why we liked them. EVERYTHING that spilled out of her mouth moving forward was about how badly Montana sucks. This woman didn't know what a level memory was (for when you want to re-connect to your truck after a stay, and even after I explained it to her, she was baffled as to why it's a benefit), but she allegedly knew everything about every other brand, as she explained why Pinnacle, Jayco, Montana models all suck compared to the Elkridge that she was showing us. She'd just returned from a three day training and couldn't remember much about what she'd been told. 

When I pointed out that she was selling against the Montana we knew a little about, she told me she was already sure that we'd made up our minds on the Montana (We hadn't), and that we were essentially wasting her time.

Then she told us we could look at another Elk Ridge at the Oasis resort, it had XXXX state plates, and we could talk to XXXX and XXXX, who are staying at the Oasis. Apparently they'd just purchased the Elk Ridge and done some modifications to it. Whether she had their permission to pass on the names or not, my wife and I were shocked at how freely she shared very private and specific information. 

As we were leaving, a man came up to Angela and playfully slapped her lips, saying ""Angela is a talkative woman. We only allow women 1400 words a day here, and she used em' up this morning."" Again, shocked. The misogyny seen here, along with the very proud NRA stickers, Trump campaign materials, and Angela's snobby, negative sales pitches against every brand of RV that she didn't sell was off putting. 

THEN, she pulled out a list, a printed, laminated list, of why Camping World, Blue Dog, and another RV place were so terrible, and why they're all ""dishonest."" We were grateful for that, as we hadn't heard of Blue Dog.

The final icing on the cake was when I commented that years ago I was a sales trainer for two of the biggest training companies in the world, and with her negative pitch, that she would benefit from training. She practically threw us off the lot.

Angela, if you're reading this, you should know that we immediately left your lot, went to Blue Dog, and are in the process of buying a 2015 Elk Ridge from Nelson, who quit Johnnie Walker's two months ago. Your over the top negativity led us to a very positive, happy place that didn't have a single negative word about your lot.



[after a nasty note from one of the folks at Johnny Walker, I've downgraded my review.
My review echoes the sentiments of *many* people on Yelp. 
We went to Johnny Walkers again just a few weeks ago; they told us over the phone they had a part that in fact, they didn't. It's a long drive up there only to find our time was wasted.

But we sure do love our RV we bought from another dealer, a dealer we'd never heard of until the people at Johnny Walker denigrated and talked down every other dealer in Las Vegas."
4,5,"I walked into the dealership not knowing whether or not I even wanted to leave with a trailer. I was met by a very friendly and helpful salesperson in Jim. I felt at ease and I never felt pushed during the process. Jim listened to my needs, expectations and hopes for the way in which I would like to use the trailer for work travel. He showed me a number of trailers and I found me exactly what I was looking for. The paperwork was processed through Angela in the office and she was a rockstar. Throughout the process she kept me informed and communicated very effectively. At no time did I feel as though she was just trying to push a sale on me. After an incredible experience through the processing it all, I was led in a walk through of the trailer by Chase who was incredible, answering a number of silly questions and really making sure I understood the in's and out's of the trailer. 
All in all I couldn't recommend this dealership anymore!"
4,5,What an amazing place for service. Broke down in Zion a guy camping gave us Ed Clarks card which had his cell called him on a Sunday he actually answered got us in the next day .Parts got special ordered motor home fixed  and repaired at a reasonable price.Trust them at anytime.  43 country coach.
4,5,This place is amazing! JOE in parts is a godsend! He took time to help me and my small family get everything we need. I would highly recommend him and JW to everyone! If your thinking of buying an rv this is definitely the place to go.
4,5,Overall a great customer buying experience starting with Troy who really took the time guiding us on our purchase followed by David who exceeded our expectations with the schooling. Thank you guys !!!
4,5,"After having a really bad experience at another RV dealer I was hesitant about going into another.  Boy, am I glad I choose Johnny Walker! Everyone I encountered was very friendly and helpful. I was shown several RV's that fit what I was looking for and I had all my questions answered. I recommend visiting Johnny Walker if you are looking to buy an RV."
4,1,so once we drove the rv off the lot this place no longer gives a crap about you. i am getting so ticked off no one seems to care or return messages or to help slove.  I gave a message to the service department twice to have one of the techs call me and 2 months later still no phone call.  the warranty is a waste of money don't buy it because hardly any one will take seems like only johnny walker stores.  we bought a year old trailer and after one month the furnence took a crap and its below freezing where we are at.  you guys just simply always say bring it down but i am more than a couple hundred miles away if you take the time to listen to customers when they speak you would have heard that part.   never ever ever will i buy here again.  they treat you nice when you buy then after you sign your sign away and take it off the lot your on you own. SO DISSAPOINTED
4,5,"Came here to get some parts that we ordered last year.  Yes, last year.  One thing led to another and we didn't originally pick up the parts that were covered under a warranty that was now expired.  They had the parts and gave them to me.  Quite friendly people.  Will come back here without hesitation."
4,2,"Very disappointed. Our sales person was rude, my husband and I were ready to leave before we found a trailer... we thought ok we like the trailer we will hang out.

I started talking about what my parents had... the sales person just shot it down talking about how crappy that company is.  Well that company was bought out by Winnebago. Add that to the report you kept telling me about.

We wanted to bring our truck back to check towing capacity and we are people of our word. We showed back up. They came back with another offer countering our first, we countered, they said they would call us back. That was 2 days ago. Haven't heard a word.  I'm tired of awful customer service. We don't need a trailer, but would have loved to work with this company.  My husband is a native las vegan and wanted to buy from this company as it is well known in Vegas. I'll be honest blue dogs was a lot more respectable and actually was willing to work with us and approved our credit, calling us back right away. We haven't bought our trailer yet, I wish i could say it would be from Johnny walker, but I don't want to buy from people who lack in customer service skill."
4,5,"Great experience purchasing our first travel trailer. This is a good, honest company, and they make sure to take care of their customers.  They answered all of our questions and were very helpful throughout the whole process. I am excited to go camping this weekend!"
4,5,"Great experience, and we've purchased from other dealers in the Midwest and in Texas. Angela was our sales person, and we couldn't be happier. No pushy sales, no negativity, and a purchase agreement that was simple and black and white. No shady math here. Angela was knowledgeable and very easy to work with. Thanks to everyone at the 3700 Boulder location for being so accommodating.   We love our new North Trail!"
4,5,"We bought a used fifth wheel from them and we couldn't be more impressed with the service. They let you stay overnight to get a lesson on how to work everything and to test everything out. We noticed a small leak last night and they guarantee everything. They took it in this morning and are replacing the part that leaks no questions asked. We even had our dogs stay with us last night and they were so welcoming to them. Their prices, quality, and standards can not be beat."
4,5,We came from Tucson. AZ to Johnnie Walker to purchase a 2017 Heartland Bighorn.  Price and  amount given for a trade was very good.  Saved a fortune from a dealer in Tucson.  Everyone we dealt with at JW was great.  Our salesman Mark was very helpful during the whole process.
4,5,I have purchased 3 RVs from JW over the last 13 yrs and have been extremely happy with sales and especially service.  We bought a new Class A MH last Sept and the one my wife fell in love with was not a brand JW sold.  We were unhappy with the service we received from the place we had to take it and were overjoyed when Ed called to me to let me know JW is now a full warranty service center for Thor.  The MH will not go to anyone else if we are in the valley and need any kind of maintenance.
4,5,I got the best service and best prices that I got anywhere in the country!  Doug and Curt were amazing!!!  I learned things I never knew and would highly recommend them to one and all but especially women because they treat you like an intelligent human being and not like an idiot.  My only regret is not finding them sooner as I would have saved a lot of money and received better service and products.  I'd like to give then TEN stars!!!!
4,5,Fantastic company and fantastic people! The whole team is dedicated to customer service and creating great relationships with their customers. Great job!
4,5,AMAZING SERVICE... the customer service that every and i mean every person provides is outstanding they make you feel like family.  i wish car buying was as simple as this. you don't feel pressured and they don't drag things on for hours like other companies.
4,5,I was very happy with my experience buying a trailer. I would definitely use them again. They were more interested in making sure we were happy with our purchase and not at all pushy to make the sale. If your buying an rv don't go anywhere else.
4,5,These folks are always the best. They fixed my hot water tank and my refrigerator. I will be back.
4,1,"Way way overpriced, staff is lazy ane can't be bothered, I have found that their prices run about. Three times. What others charge I bought a solar panel on amazon and noticed they wanted $450 more than I paid for mine."
3.5,5,"We have been Full Time RVing for over 5 years and this has earned our business as or ""go to place"" when we just want to kick back and relax. The staff here has become our extended family.  This is not a resort or Heck raising park. It's a no frills yet comfortable campground close to everything you might need or want in this area . If you respect the few rules and others this is a great place."
3,4,"After researching this side of Phoenix, I finally decided on 9920 Apartments. It wasn't the cheapest, but it was the cleanest and I loved the idea of having a garage in this climate. I'm almost at a year on my lease and re-signed for another year. The complex is quiet, and, as a guy, feel safe walking around it at any hour. My unit was clean upon move-in and rarely run into any maintenance issues. If I do, the maintenance staff has always handled problems with 24 hours. Having lived in over 12 other apartment complexes, 9920 is easily among my top favorites.

To be fair, as with any apartment complexes, there are things to consider as downsides. Currently, there is ongoing construction of a new wing that has been going on for well over a year. Also, it is true that the facility has changed ownership, but I have never run into any issues with the current management. They have always helped me with anything just like the previous owners. Lastly, there are a few times where neighbors have revved their engines at the wrong hours, but those are few and far between. Additionally, the management has done a decent job of placing notices about noise levels and restrictions.

Overall, I have really loved 9920 apartments. For me, it's exactly what I need and I couldn't be happier."
3,1,"Do not reccomend!

Stay clear of this place! It is over priced for what you get. The water pressure is very low and in the supper when you turn on the cold water it is so hot it burns your hands. So if you take showers you have to do it while the sun is down.
Upon moving in the place smelled like smoke and the office said the attempted to remove it. The carpet was bad and we were sure to document it! The management keeps changing not sure why...
Not to mention there is an office worker that really freaks me out I don't feel safe because I feel like she is stalking me. One night when the sun was down she came up behind while my headphones were in and I was walking my dogs and she startled me just to say the new keys were at the office. Though I appreciate the concern I knew the keys were there and was going to have my husband pick them up because I use the garage.
They put on a good front when you are looking to move here but don't be tricked. They are robotic with responses and have the ""there's nothing I can do for you"" attitude. There is no genuine concern for residents. 

To sum everything up just stay away from here it looks nice but there are much nicer, only come here if you want a crazy office lady to stalk you, your place to smell like smoke, and if you want to be boiled alive by your so called ""cold"" water in the summer."
3,3,"I used to living here back in 2015 with my husband and loved how quiet & private the area was .We had moved  out after our lease ended for a good 5 months and decided to move back , instead I got rude remarks about credit scores and income which by the way I was making 3,400 monthly yet to Lauren/ Lisa said my credit score had to be 600 and up .. We ended up moving to a town house in Glendale .. Sadly they look down at everyone.. working at a fancy complex does not make you high class ! As soon as you walk in if your skin isn't white enough they will find any excuse to not rent to you especially Lauren/Lisa .. This apartment complex needs some respect to all cultures !"
3,5,"Love living at theses apartments. Very friendly and safe quiet  neighborhood. Can not complain. Very clean too. Great places nearby for shopping and getting the essentials. The staff are great. The new manager Deea and her employees Lori and Lisa are nice and friendly always helping me right away. Packages are always there in the office to pick up, easy and quick because it's organized. I even get water offered everytime I go. They   even threw a catered breakfast for all of us here living at the apartments. I had a small leak and the maintenance guys were at my door ASAP with friendly smiles. They fixed the problem in no time. I would definitely recommend living here out of all the other apartments nearby."
3,1,"This is the WORST place to live! With the amount of money you're spending. You're definitely wasting it here at 9920! Management is by far the RUDEST, and most INCONSIDERATE! The staff knows NOTHING and don't know how to go about certain situations! None of them can get their story straight! Definitely filing a complaint! They're horrible!"
3,1,"Hands down the worst apartment complex I've ever stayed at/wasted money on. The double tandem garage was nice and spacious, great apartments themselves but the management is a COMPLETELY different story!! I advise you stay far away from this complex as it is like Germany in 1941. They are extremely rude and forget about requesting a fix to your apartment, they'll drag it on for several days until they ""attempt"" to fix whatever it is. They say dog friendly... forget about bringing a dog unless it's a chihuahua because big dogs are a nuisance to the management. Have a sound system? Forget about that because the neighbors will complain about a little sound at 6 pm and you'll get an eviction notice. I will never step foot in this place again nor will I ever for the life of me recommend this place to anyone looking for even a DECENT place to live. Once again, apartments are nice but the management makes the apartments as nice as a studio in north Phoenix. STAY AWAY!!"
3,1,"When it comes down to there management team we never had a problem except with ""LISA"" she  acts a certain way if you're not white, yet she's not white herself. She acts like she's better then anyone and carry's herself in such a rude way you would think that working in costumer service she would value her job and carry herself in a more professional manner. It sucks that such a beautiful property has somebody like her reflecting bad on them. Corporate well also be contacted as it seems there has been more people with the same issue as me."
3,1,"9920 has gone downhill ever since there new management team has joined. It's unsafe now SWAT teams coming in to raid apt. The gates are left open all day, my car got got towed while being in the visitors parking do not move in here"
4,5,"Stayed at many RV parks on our trips and this is rated the best. Amenities and good people to serve you. They actually act like the are there because they want to be. Nice pool at the perfect temp, clean and the patrols are always out and safe."
4,5,"This campground is your best bet if you do not want to stay at the Thousand Trails with kids. They accommodated us a few times over the last year, we even stayed as a monthly (1 month). We enjoyed this place. Great easy in and out, super excellent location, and the staff are great. Never had an issue receiving mail here. 
We stayed in two spots:
Backin spot near horse shoes
We loved this one! Tons of grass to play in and it was clean.
Pullthru -
Was very nice! We had a young couple as neighbors and it was just perfect for us.

Hands down, best campground in Vegas. This place operates like it and you get what you pay for here."
4,5,"Really clean sites, excellent staff,
Restaurant serves breakfast and lunch
2 great pools, general store, full hookups,
Directly across 15fwy from Bass Pro Shop"
4,5,"Great, great, great!!!  First time here and we loved it.  Everyone was so nice and helpful.  They keep it very clean and maintained. We also felt very secure.  I can't wait to come back!"
4,3,Nice place to stay for the price. It was $21 a night for a premium spot not far from the strip. Spaces are kind of crappy though with long grass and not much maintenance. Pool is smaller than the pictures but the check in area for RVs is pretty and security at the gate was always attentive.
4,5,"Our friends bought a new RV and stay here until their new house is built. We went to visit and it has a guard gate and is very secure. Their lot is right next to a grassy area that is also a miniature putting green. They have a huge nice building in the front that looks like a club house, a store, and extra showers and bathrooms that are very nice. The lots are spacious! Very nice place!"
4,5,"We checked in with the nicest staff member (Cee Cee) she was so helpful and worked hard to make sure we got the best discount.  They offer quite a lot of discounts. This resort has a heated pool in the winter and jacuzzi.  The grounds a clean and they have propane, air, dump etc... this place has it all with great prices. Thank you Cee Cee!"
4,4,"First night our electricity kept shorting out due to a problem with it throwing our breaker but we moved the next day and had no problems. I would suggest not selecting your ""upgraded""site until check in unless you have to. We had plenty to choose from and the cheapest rate turned out to be just as good. 
Park is very clean. Staff is friendly. Karaoke, bar and store all good. Pool questionable ... not my fav.  Vegas is HOT in summer; too hot for my dogs."
4,5,Great place to stay. Dakota at Security went out of his way to make sure we were happy we stayed there as i had bought a new vehicle and didnt have room at our site to load up to leave. World needs more people like him
4,2,"Large, very over-crowded.  very little open space, not dog friendly.  Rude and confrontational management.  Upside...  bathrooms seemed clean.  Can't recommend unless you have no other options"
4,5,"This is a really nice park.  We have eaten breakfast here everyday.  The food is good and where do you get two eggs, sausage and an English muffin for $4.99?  The hook ups are great.  The wifi has been excellent.  We are in space 802 and when I pulled up on the pad, the rig is level.  Some have complained about the RV wash but we thought the rig was fairly quiet.  And so far, haven't seen anyone speeding around the park.  I strongly recommend Uber or Lyft for getting around.  I've seen them come up to the camp spots.  The cost to go to the convention center was 12 for two of us.  It would have cost $10 to park.  We definitely like staying here."
4,4,I came here for a wedding and it was quite nice. The place is pretty and the setup for the wedding was done nicely.
4,4,"Beautiful RV Resort. Clean and well maintained. Only complaint is the WiFi, it's awful unless you are in the cafe or registration area. For such an up scale Park I expect the WiFi to better than it is. We have stayed here every year during NASCAR for the last 4 years."
4,1,"I hope that Ray Koroghli sees this review! I have stayed at your park many of times and this trip something has changed drastically. People don't seem to care when you voice concerns. Security is very friendly with people that constantly disregard your park rules to the point that nothing gets done. The permanent people are driving out your visitors. I am actually going to leave early from my stay, that is how horrible it is. I am not going to inconvenience myself any linger. Maybe you should sell it for a hefty profit like you do everything else--someone else can do a better job."
4,5,"We have been here for a few days and our experience has been great. Friendly people and nice place to have as a base is Vegas. Away from downtown but close enough to get to it quickly. Two nice pools, putting greens, cafe, small store with food items, RV items, clothes etc. 

Very secure and every space has a picnic table and a patch of grass next to your cement pad. They even have storage for car trailers for a small fee.

Grounds are very clean and pretty with trees and plants. Laundry rooms, large private showers and bathrooms if you need them. And they now recycle which being from Washington we really appreciate the effort to be green.

We planned on leaving Monday but decided to stay a couple extra days it is so nice.

Be sure to take a drive to the Valley of fire that is about 1 and a half hours out of town. It is Stunning! A beautiful drive through red rocks and silica rock formations. You can RV camp there too and it is wonderful as well."
4,5,"We visited for the first time this past weekend and had a great time. 4 of us in my new to me motorhome.  WIFI was strong we were in space 173 a pull thru site on the eastern edge of the park. When we arrived I was given without asking an additional discount on my space because of a promotion that was going on, impressive. The ladies (my wife and daughters) saw an early show Friday night  and wanted PIZZA when they got back, we called the place listed on their brochure but they were closing it was only a little before 9PM on a Friday nite.I called the office the young man gave me the phone number of a Great PIZZA place that delivers, Fantastic. In you need a rental car Oasis has a business relationship with Enterprise rent a car they will pick you up.  Not knowing that we rented a car from budget and the location was at the airport we had to pick it up in a 40 foot motorhome. We found out they have 2 RV parking spaces at the airport just in front of taxi line. When you turn in to main area stay left spaces are at end just before exit. We ate at the cafe inside the main office area 2 thumbs up from all of us. We all had different meals.  You cannot go wrong staying here, can not wait to go back."
4,4,"Very clean, equipped with just about everything you could want from a 'campground'. The registration resembles a five star hotel lobby with its marble floors and considerate staff. 
Since you'll probably not spend too much time in your RV on the campground itself when in Vegas, I'll neglect the fact that the sites resemble a parking lot and miss a shady tree or two.
All in all, a clear recommendation!"
4,5,"Now this is a TRUE Rv Resort (park) in Nevada!!

Awesome pull thrus with grass in between spots and paved grounds with 2 pools, (even an adult pool) clubhouse, exercise room, restaurant, putting green course and a convenient store. Love the staff and all the friendly people here. Great security of the entrance and grounds. There are laundry rooms in several locations. Well maintained and manicured. 

If we were going to build a RV park- we would model it after this place! 

A true Paradise in the desert."
4,1,"We made a reservation for a pull through site for 1 night a few days in advance and provided the staff with details of our Truck camper and boat trailer length for a pull through site.  Upon arrival, we noticed that the Oasis had nice grounds and seemed like a good place to stay overnight. However, at check-in we were informed that we were unable to un-hook our boat trailer from our truck camper at our site, I informed the staff that all we were going to do is get gas for our truck, get a quick bit to eat, and it should only take us an hour to take care of these items ( I informed them how difficult  it is to drive a truck camper and a 28' boat &  trailer through the tight gas stations around the RV park). The staff informed us that we are not allowed to un-hook our rig, even though travel trailers and 5th wheels are allowed to unhook from their tow vehicle at any site. The staffed informed us that we would have to park in offsite storage and have the security guard escort us in and out of the storage yard to un-hook and re-hook the boat trailer back-up if we were to un-hook at our pass through site.  I was blown away by the staff not willing to accommodate us.  I did speak with the security briefly about how challenging it is to back up a truck camper and a 28' boat in such a tight storage yard solo (wife is disabled), but he didn't care.   I also didn't go into detail that my wife is disabled and we that we have to un-hook from out boat trailer every time we stop at an RV park, so she can use a step ladder with my assistance to get in and out of the truck camper. We just left and drive the additional 5 hours home, since it wasn't worth giving our money or staying at a resort that just isn't accommodating and has rules that don't make since (Travel trailers & 5th wheels can un-hook, but boat trailers can't un-hook in a pass through site for an hour or overnight to get in and out of our truck camper?).  We have RV camped for years and have un-hooked at every campsite we have traveled too in the past 10 years and never had this issue before."
4,4,Sry. I've rv Park.  We stay approx 6 times a year and really enjoy the atmosphere.  Cafe serves a good inexpensive breakfast and laundry/bathroom facilities are nice and clean.
4,1,"Here is my take on the Oasis RV park: We stayed at this park for just over three months while I finished up a bachelor's degree in security and management.  When we first arrived we paid for three months up front and they would not refund our money when we were dissatisfied. No worries because I do understand that the park has policies. However, because of my degree, I was keeping a close eye on the security of this park. The first day I arrived I went over and jumped the fence, and continued from front to back of the park, to see if security was ever alerted or if anyone would say anything to me. No one was alerted and no one said anything to me. Later, I found out about an ATV that was stolen and many bicycles, assumed to be from the hundreds of homeless living in the tunnels that surround the park. The park takes zero consideration for these homeless and in my short amount of time there I had numerous encounters with the homeless. I once watched a homeless man run through the park and spray paint a car, another was sleeping under an RV, and multiple drug deals go down by the dog park. The problem that I see is that security personnel do not have formal training or experience in the field of security. I smelled smoke one night and told the security officer on duty. He told me that people are allowed to have camp fires at their site. Through a further investigation by me, I learned that a site was on fire and the RV was close to catching. I told the same security officer that a drug deal was going down by the dog park, he responded ""what do you want me to do?"", not something I would expect to hear from security personnel.  I have filed complaints about this officer, but he was still there when I had left. So if you stay here, beware of the homeless that jump the fence at night to take showers and wash their laundry in the shower rooms. Ask any of the security personnel what are the procedures for a fire drill, active shooter, or an evacuation in the event of a biological or chemical spill and you will get a blank stare. The problem with this is that when something happens, will you be protected? 
      Customer service is one of the worst that I have experienced at any park. Everything is fine, until I had complaints about my site or the amenities.  Let's start with the internet and just say that it rarely works. I have tried to complain about it and customer service tells me that it is free and I am welcome to call their internet provider. Nothing is ever free, that price is incorporated into their $700 a month fee. Secondly, why should we as customers call a provider that the park is paying? The park advertises that they offer high speed internet, but the fastest speed that LV offers is 3mbps. I read plenty of poor reviews about their internet before we came, but I called the front desk to find out their take. I was told that the internet works fine, but the internet works intermittently, and when you really need it that is when it will fail. The internet that they pay for is the cheapest of the cheap and LV.net has told me that the company is not willing to pay for quality internet. 
 Another problem that I have noticed is that the sewer drains stink. I usually leave my grey tanks open to allow the water to run down. However, when I did my RV had a smell of sewer. I talked to a few others and their rig smelled too when they left their drains open. There is a tank cleaner company that drives around here offering to clean your tanks for $150. It is the parks sewer problem, probably not your tank.
 My overall take is that if you are coming to Vegas to party on the strip, this is a great location. If you are looking to come to Vegas with your kids go to the old strip and stay at a nicer resort. I have seen too many bikes and belongings stolen out of this park in the short amount of time I have been here. The lack of security becomes a cat a mouse game with the homeless and the mouse is winning. The internet is horrible and customer service will advise you to pay for a hotspot, which we did and racked up another $150 bill because of my school data usage.  The RV park charges high rates, but offers low quality amenities and service.  Your security is at risk due to the location in Las Vegas (a prime tourist destination). The RV park is a soft target with a high quality of damage, due to the RV park right off the strip). The park's lack of security leaves everyone at the park in danger of a terrorist threat. 
     Check it out for yourself, walk over to the east side of the park on the front half and look at the tunnels full of homeless that steal bikes from the parks guests. The police and park are fully aware of the problem, but their hands are tied when dealing with it."
4,1,We check in when it's 102 outside. The park is half empty and they put me in a space that backs up to the freeway??? Then they know I have 2 dogs and they couldn't put me further away from a dog area when the asphalt is to hot to walk on. What the heck are they thinking.  And the space they put us is all concrete. There were grass spots all around. Do they not listen to the people that check in?? Very unhappy and so are my dogs. Then the dog area is ricks. How do you walk in hot rocks
4,5,"UPDATE: We came here after NYE- our site 424 has a nice patch of grass, picnic table and close to the office. We love this RV park!! Oasis Cafe serves up yummy breakfasts. You seat yourself and the same man with glasses helped us again. Almost all the spots are pull thru unless you're assigned a spot against the wall. 

This is a HUGE RV park conveniently located ten minutes south of the strip. We spent Thanksgiving here and really enjoyed everything- the place is clean and humongous!  You have a good amount of space in between your lot and your neighbors. The showers are individual- toilets and shower in each stall. The showers are so large my hubby and I were able to shower together. Good water pressure and hot water.  

It's very dog friendly unless you have a dog that is an aggressive breed- they do not allow some breeds for obvious legal reasons. Most dog owners had their dogs on leash, even in the dog run areas. We had one incident with a careless dog owner but the staff and park handled it well for us.  We used the dog run located on the outskirts of the park because our dogs preferred the openness and size. They didn't care for the inner dog run areas, and refused to do their business. One area isn't lit at all at night. The ones closer to the main office had better lighting at night and smelled less.  You can access the large outside dog run through a faster route but you'll need to make a $25 deposit for the gate key. I think it is worth it, unless you want to walk all the way around (which isn't bad only a 5-10 minute walk depending on where you're located in the park). Dogs must use dog runs to pee and poop or a $25 fine may apply. 

We ate at the Oasis Cafe and thought our server with glasses (I didn't get his name) was very friendly and nice. The food was pretty good in a casual diner style. The prices were very fair.  It is a nice option to have for breakfast and lunch if you don't want to cook in your rv. Currently, they do not serve beer but we were told this option may come back due to high demand.

The office has some essential items for sale and even some slot machines tucked away in the corner.  You can find things like toiletries, packaged foods, milk, cheese, butter, eggs, juices, bacon, frozen foods, yogurt, paper towels, ice cream, coffee, etc. Their small convenience store inside sells quite a few things if you run out. 

They also have shows and other activities going on like bingo on Tuesdays. A full list of activities is posted inside the main office. 

We checked in late at night (2 AM) and the staff on board for the graveyard shift was excellent. But be prepared to wait a bit because there aren't as many staff to help due to the time. There is 24/7 security and they check each time you enter the park. We felt very safe. 

Laundromat on site to wash your clothes. 

Two large pools (one adult and one for adults and kids) that are heated year round.  Tropical decor and even a fake beach! Open until 11 pm.  

There is a miniature golf course you can play as well, clubs are available inside the office.

Lyft and Uber rides are only ten minutes to the strip. There is a nice casino next door, the Silverton Casino. 

We really enjoyed our time here. No issues with the WiFi either. I was able to use my chromecast at night to stream my shows. We plan to return early next year!"
4,4,We ended up in a hotel because it was so hot (112) but we plugged the RV in and picked it up in the AM. Very friendly and seems very clean and secure.
4,2,"So this is an average to above average RV park, but not a RV RESORT!

The bathrooms and showers are clean; there are laundry facilities (if you come prepared with your own quarters); there is also a club house with a cafe that serves breakfast and lunch for a reasonable price (especially by Vegas standards) and a well stocked store; lastly there are pools. All amenities of an average RV park.  

A RV Resort is more than using the word 'resort' and charging more money. While the RV spots were paved and level, even the deluxe spot we spent more for was so close to our neighbors we could hear their conversations (when they were inside their RV). The freeway noise was a constant, and the bathrooms were a hike! 

The kicker for me ~ a resort implies a helpful, knowledgeable staff. Every question I asked I felt like I was putting them out, and they didn't have an answer. Forgive me for expecting the people working at the RV resort I am paying a premium price for could tell me where the local grocery store is! Or have some information about the Grand Canyon, not respond with ""I don't even know where the Grand Canyon is!!"" And this ""resort"" is in Las Vegas, so it is not unreasonable that there may be a shuttle to the strip. 

I was excited on check in when there was a calendar posted of the monthly events being hosted on-site, but became extremely disappointed to learn that karaoke night was adult only. We are in Las Vegas, so anyone looking for adult only entertainment on a Friday night will be at the strip, not looking to sing karaoke at a RV park, so why not allow families to participate?! Not to mention it wasn't available, again due to untrained staff.

IF they lower their prices by 20%, and replace/train their staff to be friendlier and more knowledgeable (even if they have to use cheat sheets to answer questions) I may be back. But for the money, I would rather pay the resort fee and park at Circus Circus RV park, at least it truthfully advertises what it is, and save the Uber fees getting to and from the strip. I would probably have saved a lot of money that way!"
4,5,This is the 2nd time we have been here.  This place is nice.  Very clean and friendly.  They have two pools which one is adult only.  Also a hot tub.  Nice store and easy check in.  Very close to the strip.  Yes you hear planes.. If you are in Vegas you will hear planes.  It was not annoying.  I will be back.
4,4,"Quick stop over from California on the way to Utah Parks. Really great, safe place with a convenient store, restaurant, pool and clubhouse. Definitely will be back to stay. A+"
4,4,"This is the best RV resort in Vegas, DO NOT GO TO THE KOA at the circus circus unless you don't mind parking in a Parking lot. Ok sure the KOA is right on the strip, but that might not be what you want to experience of VEGAS 24/7. This is a great RV resort with nice shaded spots and two pools( one for kids and one for adults), and a hot tub.  The staff is very helpful, and most of them live on site so they want this place to be as nice as it can be as they call it home. GREAT PLACE and the only place I stay when I am in town with our airstream."
4,5,Really enjoyed this place and can't believe we have drove past is so many times. Will be back for sure for all future RV stays in Vegas.
4,5,"We just got home from a week stay at the Oasis. We had a deluxe site. The grounds were well maintained, the restrooms clean, and the kids LOVED the pool! The café had excellent breakfast and the prices there were reasonable. We would definitely go back for another visit!"
4,4,"Very nice park. Stayed for 7 nights in late May. The park is very clean including thed restrooms. The cafe serves really good food at really reasonable prices, especially for breakfast. The service there is more than wonderful. The only negatives are that my site (23) was cracked and not level and THE AIRPORT. The park is in the landing/takeoff pattern for McCarran. During the day the landings are not really a problem but the takeoffs are horrendous. We really are Pahrump people but would stay here again if we were to stay in the city."
4,5,"We enjoyed our stay here. The RV spots are spacious and the showers are large and clean. We never had to wait to use them. There is free mini golf, horse shoes, and bocce ball and a lovely pool area with a separate one for children. We decided to add a night along with another couple but they were going to be full due to a rally. The staff was very helpful in securing cancelled spots for us as they became available. We did not notice any pet issues."
4,2,"Huge, Loud and Smelly

This place is clean. The dog area is big and underused. 

But there are sites for over 600 RVs, most of them occupied in Spring (and good luck finding your assigned site), it's in the flight path for McCarran Airport / LAS, and WiFi at your site runs an additional $6.99 PER DAY.

Our site also came with a bonus poop smell wafting in from outside. It didn't come from our two dogs - we know what they smell like. 

Yes, it's in the city limits, but for what they charge, you expect a better experience."
4,3,"Grounds were great, amenities were great, restrooms & showers were clean. Water pressure in the shower is not so great. Advertises free Internet but there is no internet. We tried to get onto the provider but failed every time and after asking front desk staff we were given their provider's information. We were only there two days so just gave up on it. Security was good at the gate but not so good in the park. We had noisy neighbours and finally asked to be moved to another site. Lucky for us another site was available as this is a very busy park. Our second day was better, definitely more peaceful. Watch out for the promotional person in the lobby - the booth says its Good Sam and has local information - but its not, its a presentation for something and they will even ask for a $20 (refundable) deposit to the presentation. Overall this is a nice RV site and very close to the Strip."
4,1,"My husband and I we're here for 6 months, we felt I unwelcomed from the moment we stepped in the office! We have a 2014 Voltage and a Truck to pull it, Chevy 2013, also I'm behind him in a Cadillac 2011, they told us on the phone we could choose a spot they had plenty! When we walked in, no spots left! Just one in front of the dog area which I can't use!!! My Pomeranian was in Quartine we we're going to Hawaii!everytime I went into the office Jack the manager was so rude!! I was told not to come in the office to check my mail, I ride my bike with my Pomeranian in the basket I was told by someone stayn there to keep
Riding around and see what happends to me!!
I met a lady who had to dogs poisoned and killed because they sprayed by her front door! Poison!!! 
They killed my plant that was in a pot by my front door!!
Security told me there we're 7 people set up in the park watching everyone!!!
I have more!! Contact me"
4,5,"What a great place to RV camp. Friendly staff. Friendly neighbors. Clean pools. Clean restrooms. Clean facilities throughout. Security at front gate is always smiling to greet you back ""home"".
This is my families first time at this RV resort and we will be back again and again. Definitely not the place to party outdoors with music blasting all night long. But that is just fine with me.. I left my 20's behind years ago. At night this resort is quiet, peaceful and enjoyable. Lots of people hanging out or walking around and enjoying themselves outside, just no craziness. 
The facility has 1 adult and 1 family pool. Both are attached to the main building. Both have gates for security too. The family pool has a great sand beach that surrounds half the pool. It was cleaned and manicured daily. Yes it was raked every morning. 
Small shop on site for snacks, treats and the stuff you might have left back home on accident.
Check-out and check-in times are very reasonable. Noon and 1pm respectively. 
This facility is not walking distance to strip if that is what you are looking for though. I am not.
This is LV how I want to enjoy it! Minus the craziness and hookers and hobos right in the strip.
All parking is enclosed within the secured facility as well, so park your car, set up your rv, relax and actually enjoy your vacation!"
4,5,"A bit expensive but a really good resort. Can't fault it. Great location near the strip, two pools, clean, well spaced lots. Facilities all work. RV services via local contractors for just about anything. Wifi free but very congested. Intermittently unusable. Would pay extra for good internet access. They should offer that."
4,5,"Stayed one night on our way to Utah.  The site was level and the staff was friendly.  Cant beat the price on a Saturday night.  $51.00.  If you don't want to drive up the strip, the office will call a cab for you.  Just so you know, the cab fare to Paris Casino was $30 one way.  The do have a convenience store and supplies.  I would stay there again."
4,5,"The campground is immaculate and beautifully manicured. The managers are exceptional in making sure their guests are completely comfortable and have no problems. What problems can there be? None because they see to it that every consideration possible and care taken for their guests are attended to. How about PRIVATE bathrooms and showers for their guests who want to use the facilities. Extremely pet friendly. Sprinklers for the grass to make sure it is green and well maintained.
Forget all that negative writing they posted. It is now one of the better RV parks in the country if not the best!!!"
4,3,"I thought one of the nicest rv parks I'd ever been in, I'm from Alberta , Canada,  but one quite costly lesson I learned just because there is vendors listed on the nice book flyer your given when you check in, with all your information and it lists mechanical companies and other suggested vendors that I am sure they pay to get their name on that book , it by far doesn't mean that they are honest and good.  because believe you me they are not.  it cost me so dearly that I had to tell everyone that I hope reads this and doesn't get burned like I did . I am a Hurtin albertan meaning our economy is in the tank big time.  but I am hurting a lot more now to the tune of over 10,000.00 dollars from a mechanical company that is listed in oasis nice flyer you get when you check in. and I will never get that back.  so don't ever think they do a good job . and they don't hesitate to rip you off big time."
4,5,"2nd time staying here. Super clean facilities. Helpful and friendly staff. Good security. The pool area was so much fun. There is a family pool and a separate adult pool/spa area. Our site was a premium site and was spacious with a picnic table. Nice and level flat cement. The hookups are lit so even if you arrive late you can see what you are doing. The shop in the reception area is very well stocked with basic RV accessories and basic food items and snacks. The on site restraint has very reasonable prices ($3.99 for a pancake and sausage/bacon breakfast dish) along with other lunch and breakfast items. No dinner. There is also several companies on site that offer services for fee including a mobile rv wash, blinds and tank cleaning service. Great location right off the 15 and 5 miles south of the strip. Great family stop. Will be here again."
4,4,"This is a nice park.  A bit set away from the happening strip.  Taxi fare if you don't have a car is maybe $30-$40 to the Mirage area. I stayed with friends and would have wanted to let them relax at the park while I went back to the strip, but with the cost, I passed.  They have a general store that had the basic's, however no Beer or wine sold.  They have 2 pools one for Adults and one for Families. I don't know if the Europeans could read the signs as there was a couple of instances where they would bring in their kids to the adult pool.  The bathrooms were clean with and each individual suite had the bathroom and shower.  The dog park was nice for those with canines.  If you have dogs, you might want to ask for a space close to that.  Also some spaces have tree's that might restrict your use of your awning."
4,5,Beautiful rv park perfect for visiting Vegas. It's a legit oasis. Perfect distance from the strip and you can't beat the price for Vegas
4,5,Great hidden gem. In all my years never knew this was here. Truly feel like you're in paradise!!
4,2,"Very disappointed.  Check in people were pleasant but made it a point to tell us that if we booked a week at the weekly rate, there were no refunds if we left early, no matter what.   Didn't take long to find out why.   We have a 40 ft Motorhome and she assigned us a site that she said would fit us just fine.  Problem was, motorhome fit, but no place to park the car, we were slightly outside the line and had a warning on the car the next morning.  We parked on our patio for the rest of the week, giving us no where to sit outside or BBQ.   Laundry another experience, after 45 minutes in the dryer, my clothes were still cold, no heat at all.   For the price, they definitely need to keep things up better.   There was loud music four of the seven nights, from 8PM until midnight."
4,5,"This is a beautiful, huge RV park located south of McCarran Airport near Las Vegas Blvd.

We made two stays at this park in late September / early October for a total of 7 nights.  There is a very large pull-through area to park your rig while checking in, which is nice since it can get very busy during afternoon check-in for the 700+ site park. In the park there are both pull-through and back-in sites that will accommodate even the biggest rigs.  

This really is a resort in the Las Vegas sense with fancy lighted steps and columns leading up to the registration office and a pool area with both an adult and kid's pool as well as a spa.  The pools are surrounded by grass and palm trees with a sandy beach area and waterfall near the kid's pool.  There is also an 18 hole putting course that is free to use.

There is a nice restaurant that is only open for breakfast and lunch.  We ate here a few times, and while the food is not fantastic, it is nicely done and very reasonably priced.

The park's wifi works well, however the available television channels are only in analog, so we primarily used our satellite dish.

There is 24 hour security at the main gate and you must show your access pass when entering.  The park is also EXTREMELY strict about its 10 mph speed limit.  Park employees in golf carts have radar detectors and you will be fined.  They are also EXTREMELY strict about cleaning up after your pets.  There is a very large dog run area, however there are signs posted saying that the area is under security camera surveillance and you will be fined $25 for not cleaning up after your pet.  I didn't see any cameras, but I also didn't see any dog poop, so apparently the signs are doing their job.  Personally I can't stand people that speed in RV parks endangering kids and people that think they are too good to clean up after their dogs, so I appreciate the strictness.

The bathrooms are individual rooms with showers.  There is also a nice laundry area.

The park gift shop is well laid out with lots of souvenirs, clothing, and even slot machines.  There is also a workout room.

Overall, a very nice park, and a great place to stay when visiting Las Vegas."
4,5,"This RV Resort is one of the best in the West and one of my top 2. It's easy to get to & from the freeway and it's close to the strip, it's clean and they have a list of rules that keeps this place clean and family friendly. The pools are nice. One for adults and one for the family. Food, drinks, souvenirs in the gift shop and a restaurant inside. Laundry facilities are available. The rv spots are a little wider, so you actually have plenty of Awning extension space. Employees are friendly and that's always a plus. If you love the heat, well it's ""Vegas Baby"" and there's plenty to go round. They also have an onsite mobile Coach wash, just in case you rig is dirty from the road. Check this place out on your way by. You'll love it! I do. Keep up the good work Oasis and I'll definitely be back."
4,1,"Beautiful resort - there is no denying that.  However - they have the most unprofessional, rudest employees I have ever encountered.  They offered no help, I was not greeted when I arrived nor did I get a smile.  For a resort this upscale and expensive,. I expect both from the employees.  We left immediately, did not stay for our reservation.  There are other parks in Las Vegas - may not be as nice but absolutely have better staff."
4,5,"I'm giving this place a 5 star rating because of all the amenities it offers. Super friendly staff, easy to park and check-in with designated drive thru spots for registration. 
PROS: easy access, well manicured lawns, putting course, horse shoe area, pull-throughs with plenty of room between RVs. Several pools, a jacuzzi, clean and roomy bathrooms/showers. They have about 7-8 separate dog run areas that are gravel but they have doggie bags and trash right there. I wish there was a little more shade over by the runs because it does get extremely hot. They have a beautiful rose garden and fountain. Breakfast at the café was amazing and only $10 for two.  There is a small store with souvenirs and some RV supplies. They have services such as mobile RV detail, sanitation of your tanks, blind repair, etc. 
TIP:  those services book up quick so make a reservation early (before you get there if you can). The Silverton and Bass Outdoor is just across the freeway. 
CONS:  wish there was a little more shade since it gets soooo hot."

4,2,This was an ok park but very disappointed that we could not get any internet or wifi. This is Vegas you would expect it to work!!
4,5,"Second time we have stayed here as we passed through traveling.   Park is well organized and clean.   Pools are nice and they have mini golf for the kids.   They have adult and kid pools so you can get away if you need too. 

Nice place and worth the stay if your in an RV in Vegas.     Across frwy from Bass Pro Shop so you can stock up on camping stuff...."
4,5,"Very nice RV Park! Very clean and paved sites. Had a nice pull thru site! 2 beautiful pools! Cute cafe on site! Friendly staff! Very close and convenient location to the Strip, stores and restaurants! Would definitely come back to this park!"
4,4,"Fancy RV resort.  Nice staff, clean level sites, 30/50amp, restrooms, restaurant, adult and family pools, free wifi, and rv wash service available.  Deluxe sites include a table, grass and tree area.  Pull thru and backup sites.  Close to strip (10 min cab/uber ride) With NV resident and Internet discount, back in deluxe site was $56."
4,1,"Lovely park but bad customer service.  Reserved online, filled out all questions, including that we had 4 golden retrievers with us.  Checked in, paid by credit card, as we were leaving the reception desk she said something about our 3 dogs, I said no, we had 4.  She said in her system it said 3, that I must have lied on the reservation....well, no I didn't and if I had why would I have corrected her!  She got rude in my opinion.  We had only driven there because we were happy that they made the reservation with 4 dogs!  They refunded our card and we had to leave.  They need to fix their reservation system and their attitude.  BTW, she said it was a health law, but we stayed at another park in Las Vegas no problem, local licensing laws generally don't apply to transients."
4,5,"We are new to traveling with a rv and wasn't sure what to expect from a rv Park . Oasis rv Park has set the standard high . Our family gives it 5 stars for cleanliness /staff/ease of checking in and out . We want to especially give a shout out to Jeffery our waiter in the cafe . I usually don't do yelp reviews unless someone has gone out of their way on costumer service (which is hard to find now a days ) Jeffrey was so friendly , personable and set my mind at ease about traveling into Zion . Oasis will always be our go to when traveling threw Vegas"
4,5,"A friend recommended this resort to us.  Clean, safe, well maintained.  Guarded/manned entryway!!  Easy on/off from Blue Diamond Rd. and GREAT signage at the entrance.  Paved pull-thru sites that are flat!  One challenge we had is that our two GPS devices took us to two locations.  The resort is NOT downtown.  Exit 33 on I-15 South is the location. Two shopping centers nearby.  Lsa Vegas Blvd. takes you to the casinos without having to get on the highway."
4,5,As far as Rv parks in Las Vegas this is the best. Two huge pools and jacuzzi. One pool is a family pool another 18 and older. There are several rock waterfalls and a sand beach with thatched roof huts. In the background from the pool is two large time share buildings that give you a feeling of being in Hawaii or as close as you can get in the d3sert. Your a short drive from the strip and other area locations.  The park is a little barren but the pads are level with ample extra parking for guests. I was pleasantly surprised with the indoor facilities store and restaurant. I haven't tried cable TV which is free yet or the internet which is an extra cost however I found when you pay for Internet at rv parks it usually works.
4,5,The oasis RV resort is one of the most beautiful places we have been to. The cafe has the best pancakes ever. Ask what the secret ingredient is. The staff is very welcoming and are eager to help you enjoy your stay.
4,5,"Oasis has been our go to resort in Las Vegas since 2009. Never been disappointed, friendly and helpful staff and it's always clean. In fact we will be staying with them again in October, 2015."
4,4,"The adult pool was a welcome treat on a hot summer afternoon.  Just stayed here one night but the park was clean and offered a lot of amenities including a store, playground, and nicely spaced RV spots."
4,1,"This RV park is among the worst in the country. Theft is rampant. Management is dishonest. Your stay could be unilaterally terminated by management even after you have fully paid for it.

In the first week of my stay, I lost my outdoor chairs and floor mat went I left my site during the day. I reported the theft to Oasis security and was told that it common. I learned that I needed to be more careful, but my lesson did not prepare me for what was to come next. It turned out that Oasis management also behaved like thieves.

First, extortion. When I notified the front desk that I was checking out on March 3, 2018, they told me that I had to pay for 5 extra days -- through March 8. I did not agree to pay for the days I did not need. The front desk person (Erin) said I could stay till March 8 and they would give me a refund for any unused day, if I stop by to check out in person. 

Then on March 3, the day I was supposed to check out, there was a massive storm on the East Coast and my flight was cancelled. I was busy trying to reschedule my flights and my appointments back home. When I got back to my campsite, it was occupied by a young couple who was planning to stay for two days. Oasis sold my site to another party after they collected money from me.

When I saw the manager (Sue), she said that it was my fault for not being on my site at check-out time on March 3. I said I already paid for the site through March 8. She said that did not matter because she gave me a refund after kicking me out.

That is Oasis RV Park. They can unilaterally terminate your stay after you have paid for it.

In my case, Oasis collected $104 from the new tenants for two days of short term stay and gave me a refund of $84 for cutting my stay short. They will kick you out when they can get more money from someone else."
4,5,"Very nice RV park. Each time we pass through Vegas, we go back and forth about staying overnight in our RV. This time we made the decision to stay. We chose Oasis RV resort based on the Yelp reviews. We called on our way in and were told there were plenty of spots left. We pulled in and were treated by a friendly security guard who pointed us to the parking and main office. Walked into the main office and we were politely greeted. The rates were fair based on a 50 ft pull through site with full hook ups. We asked about dinner and were given several solid local suggestions. 

Pulled into the site with no problem. The site was clean and level on a concrete pad. I didn't even have to disconnect the truck I was towing.

The kids loved the pool. The bathrooms and showers were clean and well maintained. 

I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend to anyone."
4,4,"This is a great rv park! Check in and out was easy.  The park had great spots with good sized grassy areas.  The pool area is great and had a family pool and adult pool.  

My only issue was the roads were narrow and it was hard to get the rv into its spot.

The restaurant was great also! Food was affordable and tasted like something I'd make my family. #rvlife"
4,4,Staying at the oasis it is centrally located to everything you would want to see in Vegas or Henderson.They were very clean spaces and trash was picked up regularly the restrooms were very clean and the people were friendly and the security there was top notch. We will be back. we traveled in a 25 foot travel trailer. I would have given them five stars but I thought their price was a little high.
4,5,"A very nice and well run park.  Manager is especially helpful.  I could nitpick and come up with a couple of complaints, but they are minuscule.  A great place to stay for an affordable rate!"
4,4,"Prologue:
I purchased a Class B motor home not long ago and so recently transitioned from  lodging in a hotel to staying at an RV park when visiting Las Vegas.

The Plot:
My girlfriend and I stayed at this RV park for three nights during the last week of November.

The Scene:
The daily rates are very reasonable for a destination like Las Vegas, which saves us a lot of money compared to staying in a hotel.
The park is clean and easy to navigate, the majority of the sites are convenient pull-through, and the public bathroom/washroom facilities are clean, private, and spacious.
The cafe and store are clean and convenient.
This park is also located within a reasonable distance from a Deuce/SDX bus stop.

The Rest of the Story:
The only glitch was that the shower stall I chose on one of the nights during our stay was out of hot water. 

Epilogue:
This is a great deal, a nice place to stay, and will always be our first choice for lodging when visiting Las Vegas."
4,4,"This place is a great place to escape from reality for a few days. The RV campground is very large and has a number of amenities, which makes your stay pleasant. It has a close proximity to the Strip.

Unfortunately, the spaces are tight in between units and it is located next to an Interstate. Even with this, we slept soundly in the RV campground. The security at the front gate was a positive even though the RV was in a good neighborhood.

The pool, laundry facilities, bathroom were all well maintained and clean.

Would I recommend this park? Absolutely. Would we come back? Absolutely.

Informational: We travel in a 36' Class A RV."
4,4,"Outstanding RV park. When you see Five Star rigs parked one after another you know you're in a good place. A few more trees in some areas would be a plus, but that's nitpicking."
4,5,"Definitely a place I would come back to. Clean facility, security doing regular rounds periodically in the evening. Pools for adults when it just couples weekend out and a pool for the kids. Not too far from the strip. Evening is nice and peaceful. We arrived from the river late and were able to go out and wash our clothes. No coin machine onsite therefore make sure to have change. I personally didn't make it inside the store but my husband said they had a lot to offer. Restaurant was nice for morning breakfast. Almost like a hotel check in style. Best money I have spend yet at an RV resort. Keep the good work up guys. It's amazing."
4,2,We have been staying here for the last 4 months. The bath house hot water needs addressed. Tried alternating times to shower but still no hot water. Reported at least twice a week... Electrical breakers continue to trip causing A/C in bath house to not work.. Reported on several occasions... Sprinkler system comes on and floods our site. Reported on numerous occasions.. Several pieces of gym equipment does not work.. When you pay 1k a month you would expect a better class of service.
4,5,Stayed for the night. Nice clean restrooms and a beautiful pool. On the road the next morning to finish driving cross country. Daughter left necklace in the bathroom and it meant a lot to her. Called the place and they found it. The necklace is getting mailed to our new place in Virginia. Thank u so much!  It was an heirloom.
4,5,"Great location, great staff, fantastic amenities! Best gift/grocery I've seen. This is a very large RESORT!  ! Adult/spa and family pools with waterfalls and a natural grass 18 hole putting green. 
We don't want to leave!
15% Discount for WIT members! :-)

38 ft. 2014 Adventurer with tow."
4,4,"Very nice park. Upon arriving, you are greeted by security at the entrance. Nice safety feature. You are directed to a check in lane and can go in to register. Registering was similar in feel to a hotel where it was very professional looking and they were ready to greet you. Upon registering, you go to your site.

The spots are so what sterile where there is a lot of cement and it's akin to a decorated parking lot. We have pets so you need to use the pet areas. Cool feature here is the 15x15 ft gated individualized pet run which I thought was cool. They also have a restaurant from 7:30to 2:30.

We stayed Sunday night so we did not expect a backpack blower going at 7:30 on Monday morning. 

About 3miles from the new hotels. We Uber to Fremont at 18 bucks. Would stay again."
4,5,"This is our absolute favorite RV resort stay at! We stop by here every time we are in the Vegas area. It's quiet and relaxing, yet close enough to the strip that you can catch a quick and cheap Uber or Lyft ride. The resort has nice amenities and a well stocked store. There is also a little cafe that is open for breakfast and lunch. The pool is nice and they have a putting green course! We love it here!"
4,5,"This park is nice! Very clean, large spaces and (for Las Vegas) pretty quiet. Multiple pools, lots of dog friendly areas and a nice little shop just incase  you need something. It's also very secure. No one gets in unless they're staying there, and security is a huge plus especially when you have a family. We will stay here again for sure!"
4,4,"Huge RV park just off the 15 on the southern edge of town. We didn't have a reservation because we were pulling in at 2am, but they have someone available 24/7 to check you in.
The pull-through so are easy to access, are level concrete pads, pretty nice!
There were restrooms just across from us and the clubhouse was just two rows over for easy access.
Our only real negative was that we happened to be parked next to the only RV with toddlers who woke us up at 7:04 am by running around literally screaming and crying. Ugh. I like kids, but since we didn't get in and settled til 3am,....
Definitely a good place to stay!"
4,4,This was a nice clean place to stay!  Very quiet.  Bathrooms were clean and air conditioned - park is spic and span!  Well tended to!
4,1,"Definitely avoid this ""resort"". As you can tell from the video, there is a lot of traffic and airplane noise. No shade, you park on a concrete slab accented with dirty clay rocks. Spaces are very close to each other. The bathrooms/showers are gross! I would not consider this an oasis or a resort. We are truly regretting the decision to stay here, especially since we were offered a free room in downtown Las Vegas."
4,1,Were a party of four RV s .  We have had reservations for a year for four sites together.  When we arrived today we had 4 sites but they were not together.  We are very displeased.  Management can. Do nothing to mitigate this mix-up. Watch out for this place!
4,5,"We found a jewel with this park , nice big spacious sites , 2 pools, horse shoe pits and other things to do . They have 700 sites on 55 acres easy on and off the highway , just across I-15 from the Bass Pro Shop. Spotless laundry and bathrooms very nice staff. They also have a cafe open from 7:00 am till 2:30 pm with nice meals at a very nice price. We will be back with the good neighbor discount it was $55 a night ."
4,5,Thank you to all of you for the nice stay. This is a huge resort with mobile homes and residents . No one bothers anyone . It is very clean and lots of activities. They have the best pet walk I have ever seen! My babies loved it!! Great price in summertime half off!! We have family here so this was really convenient for us !
4,4,Nice park. Spots are set up nicely with a pad for a picnic table and to walk on. Pet area is small and there were a lot of pets. I did not like walking my girls over an area where so many dogs were relieving themselves and then having them and me walking back into our RV. I did not use any of the amenities but everything was nicely kept and it seems if you stay during peak times that there are many things going on and that Sunflower is a happening place.
4.5,5,"I usually cringe having to go to the tire store. You know, stuck there for hours in the lobby with nothing but old import magazines, but this was not the cliche tire experience. These guys were FAST and professional. 

We had called a couple stores looking for a set of 4 particular tires. We were out and about and wanted to get them done today. No where had the tires in when we called, but Phoenix Tire told us to head down and they'd have them delivered within the hour.  The service was quick once we got there, we were in and out, and the break room where we waited was nice and clean. The prices were great, about $100 less than we had been looking at to order them online (Toyo Proxies ST.). To top it off, everyone was friendly.  We definitely found out new tire store."
4.5,5,Thank You for The Wonderful Customer Service From Phoenix Tire. While on Vacation in Arizona Our Left Rear Tire was punctured by a Razor Blade causing a Flat. We called AAA Premier Service Roadside Service And Within less than 5 Minutes Bret appeared and Replaced The Flat Tire with The Spare On Our 2016 Toyota Camry. Bret Referred Us to Phoenix Tire On W Buckeye Rd. They provided Excellent Customer Service Expeditiously. We were Serviced within 1 Hour and The Cost For 2 Tires was Phenomenally Inexpensive.  5 Stars
4.5,1,Took my truck in for a gasket leak from the front u joint.  The wrote up an estimate for 941.00.  The estimate stated there were 3 items to fix. I got a second estimate for 250.00. I got it fixed and the truck is running great with no leaks. I believe they Phoenix tire over charged me by 651.00.  Be careful of them
4.5,5,Thank you for your awesome service and for having us done in just under a hour . I was wowed by the price of 4 tires plus the installation. This is the place to be if you want a great deal and friendly service . Thank you to DJ for referring us
2,1,"Quite possibly, the most incompetent and worst customer service I've ever encountered (and that includes Rogers!). I used them for a longer rental while my car was being repaired (6 weeks) - the initial car they delivered to me wasn't the one I requested over the phone, with one tire was damaged and it looked pretty run down (esp considering they were charging $150/day!). After several phone calls, they delivered another car (other than the one agreed upon). They proceeded to bill my insurance for exorbitant rates based on the cars they delivered instead of the one I agreed to rent, despite my repeated requests to rectify this. I repeatedly expressed my worry over exceeding the insurance allowance and each time they said ""we're okay dude"". After one such call, I received a frantic call from them the next day saying that they had gone over the limit, but not to worry - ""you can just ask the insurance company to up your limit"". I could go on and on...but I'm getting annoyed just thinking about it. These people are incompetent and dishonest."
2,5,"I was given a coupon for the 30 minute exotic car test drive for my birthday and I have to say it was the best present ever. I was the first customer to take out the Lamborghini Gallardo and it lived up to all my expectations and more. When I arrived at Affinity for the drive I was worried when I didn't see the car in the lot but after I walked into the office to check in the guys showed me into the garage where they were washing it before my drive. I was a little sceptical at first about having one of the rental guys along for the ride because I didn't think I would be able to enjoy the car to it's full potential. However, Alberto was great. He said have fun, so I did. If you're looking for an attention grabbing car this is it, immediately after pulling out all eyes were on the car and us (especially the girls). Once I reached the 407 looks were no longer of concern, the performance was and nothing sounds like an Italian V10 with 560 horsepower. It was a symphony unlike anything I have ever heard. If you like cars but can't afford to buy one of these cars renting from Affinity is definitely the way to go, everyone should drive this car at least once in there lifetime."

Just so we are all aware: this is a duplicate review from the other Bates International page on Yelp. If you're considering doing business with these guys, you need to read what I have to say below.

My experience with Bates has been a long and arduous experience in disappointment.

Allow me to clarify that this is not a review concerning Bates' actual services- I didn't get the chance to experience those. This review is focusing on the way Bates treats its customers, and the way it approaches moral issues with complete immorality.

My family was en route to Bates' headquarters in Las Vegas when the rear tire of our minivan blew out. We flipped 3 times in the desert near California City. My parents, my two younger brothers, my niece and my aunt were all in the car. Our minivan was totaled and my father had to be evacuated via helicopter. My mother, aunt and brother were all admitted to the hospital. My brother had a gash in his head and my aunt had fractured her wrist. The hospital couldn't find anything wrong with my mother, though it became apparent later that her entire collarbone had shifted, causing her so much pain that she couldn't even undress to take a shower that night.

We contacted Bates as soon as we could, even amid all the chaos. They simply stated to us, cancellations cannot be refunded. I told them that this isn't just a cancellation- we were physically unable to meet our reservation due to extraneous circumstances. This was a year ago, and reading the email correspondence, I can see that my mother, who was handling the issue, was brushed aside because of her English (we are first generation immigrants from Hangzhou). So in May of 2013 I decided to speak to the company myself. 

It took an entire summer of ignored calls, emails that went nowhere, to elicit a rude response in which Bates hid behind their company policy. They claim their hands are tied and they can do nothing about the policy that they themselves instated.

The morality of this issue is really, really simple. This company refused even a partial refund for a family that experience a life threatening accident on the way to their headquarters. To top it off, their COO, Michael Williams, was extremely shifty and managed to beat around the bush for an entire summer before giving me anything close to a straight answer. 

The RVs might be fine- if you were to make it to claim your reservation. But buyer beware- the moment something unfortunate befalls you on the way to Bates, rest assured they will take advantage of your situation and make you feel like a turtle on your back. I want to make something clear; every single company we booked with for this trip reimbursed us when we showed them the medical documentation. Every single one, except for Bates. 

If it were me, I'd stick with companies that know how to take care of their customers."
1,1,Really great to see the business owner trying to defend her shitty company.

1,1,"Potential renters beware: These folks are ripoff artists. Many, if not all, of the RV's are owned by others. Bates pays the owners (sometimes), and will try to overcharge you. There are extra fees for many things that should be included.  Honesty is not in their vocabulary.
When we allowed our RV to be rented out, we put two electric scooters in the RV at their suggestion, to be used as an ""extra"", which should increase rentals. However, the scooters went ""missing"". Of course, they denied even telling us to keep the scooters in the RV."
5,5,"First off, I'd just like to thank Tim. From jump, he was nothing but helpful, honest, and informative. If you're looking for someone who knows their stuff, look no further! My fiance and I had a huge ongoing issue with our breaks due to a dishonest company, and finally we got the truth as to what was going on from Tim. He informed us that the brand new brake job we paid for, was in fact not brand new, and our rotors had NEVER even been replaced, just shaved down, and incorrectly at that. ( Sidenote- this company sent us to 3 of its shops to have this done ""correctly"" and ""fix the issue"" only to screw us over more each time. To say they took advantage and sucked every dollar they could would be an understatement) After informing us of why the car was making these noises, and why we were having issues with the brakes, by physically spending the time with us to explain and show us what was going on, he promised to fix our issue, and his confidence in this really showed. He even made himself available on a Sunday, to come in and do our brakes for us. He let us know upfront how much everything would be (totally reasonable prices) what to expect, how long it'd take, the whole run down, and didn't miss a beat. We truly had never felt more confident in someone taking care of our car. They say it's tough to find an honest mechanic, and trust me, we were weary of any and everyone, but Tim changed that as soon as we met him. He got the job done in a more than timely manner, and we have not had any issue with the brakes thus far. Not only did Tim fix a horrible issue we'd been dealing with, but made us feel safe driving, which is a big deal. We honestly can't thank him enough and will absolutely be going back when need be! Thanks so much Tim! You're great at what you do!"
5,5,"I just tried this place out since it's so close to home and I was pleased. I called for a next day appointment and was accommodated, got to the shop and was greeted by Tim, I think he maybe the owner, he was very pleasant and did the work in a very timely manner. I didn't once feel like I was being sold or ripped off as I do sometimes when taking my car in for services because they often try to talk me into purchasing extra services or simply do extra things without my knowledge and charge me for it. I will be coming back."
5,5,"Tim does great work is honest, communicates any and all issues related to your vehicle and he does so in a way that any layman can understand.  He gives you a good faith estimate of the costs up front and is forthcoming with any updates discovered during the repair process.  Tim worked on my Rv and my car and they both are running excellently.  Tim is my repairman for all of my vehicles from this day forward.  I highly recommend his repair services to all which I have a chance to tell!  Thanks for the good service Tim."
5,5,"Those of you who follow me know I avoid a five-star rating.

Automotive history:  I do all my automotive work.  Why, I had a horrible experience more than 20 years ago with a shop that basically said to sue them instead of fixing the problem they created.

From that, I self taught and changed my Toyota celiacs 20R engine with a 21RU.  I do my own brake work including but not limited to changing out the entire braking system.   Most recently changing out my supercharger on my Mercedes C230 Kompressor.

With that, I recently became injured however, that has not stopped the need for automotive repairs.  I found Tim on Groupon, called him and scheduled an appointment.  When my wife and I arrived, he was explaining services to another customer.  He was thorough and honest.  He worked to save the customer money while giving easy to understand information.

I do believe that I have found a trustworthy family mechanic as when he inspected my car, he touched and shook nothing, he used his flashlight to search for tell tail signs of problems, then performed the work hired to do.  He was very friendly and personable with a focus on customer service.

Yes, this was my first time using him however, you know that being a psychologist helps me decide quickly what motives may be.  Tim had a motive to give us great service, at a fair price, and in a friendly way.  He did that therefore, has earned more business from our household, and those of our friends and followers."
2.5,5,"First off I called 7 mobile mechanics...5 didnt even come and try they told me my 1973 Dodge Dart was to old for them to work on..the 6th guy came and tried and didn't come back wouldn't even answer my call....My 7th call was to Jeffs Auto & truck repair.I wish this had been my first call Jeff came to my house and within 2 hours had my car running..There are a lot of wanna be  ""mobile mechanics"" out there..but Jeff actually knows what he is doing..A huge THANK YOU to Jeff.. you sir are the real deal"
2.5,2,"Quality work but over priced significantly. I called and spoke with Jeff who was extremely nice and accommodating explained what was going on with my trailer and he said they could fix it someone would be by in the morning around 10am. I was at 11:30 still nothing then I believe his name was Cameron called and was asking what I needed service with and on. I was a bit frustrated that I went over this in great detail with Jeff I would have assumed that info would be passed along, I he to read explain to Cameron. He said he'd come out the  next morning to determine what was needed and completed later that day. He made a visit and called that next day to let me know he'd found the bolts at two different auto zone's but had to do some running around to get them, ok I said. Then, he said I'll come back tomorrow morning and complete. I get a call around 10am asking me where I purchased the bolts I had. I didn't question him even though he told me he already had the correct bolts. I get home from work at 1 he's not there, I think he showed back up around 3 and completed by 5. The entire job was less than two hours but I paid over $900 for this. The lack of ability of the mechanic to get the right parts the first time should not be my problem, or at my cost in this case, it was. Will.never.do business with again."
5,5,"Customer service at its best! The quality of service that i got was way beyond what i paid for. 

I won't have second thoughts in recommending these guys with friends and family or anyone for that matter. 

Now i know why you guys have a very high customer satisfaction rating."
5,5,"Thanks Matt and Ryan for being reasonable, honest, on-time, and doing the job right. The price I was quoted was exactly what I paid. I appreciate the job well done and the professionalism guys!"
5,5,"Such a great place to do business with when something as inconvenient as your windshield cracking! Friendly and professional. They clearly care about their customers. Plus their prices cannot be beat.

I actually drove to their location in Gilbert, where I came to realize they are more so just an ""call and they come to you service"". Oops! I felt bad, but the owner welcomed me in and we set up an appointment. I have an older minivan and he said he wanted Ryan to do the job as he was the most experienced.

We schedule it for 7:30am the Saturday before Memorial Day. Ryan called me at 7:15 stating they were about 15 minutes out. They arrive right on time, called me when they got it, I moved my car out the garage a bit, and they got to work!
While they working on was able to sit inside and Ryan just called me again when they were done. So nice and it didn't take long at all!

I thanked them and while I was paying, asked then if they were doing anything fun this weekend. Ryan said it was actually his day off today, but they don't take any customers for granted and wanted to make sure I got my windshield fixed. 

They really do a great job here and I would recommend them to anyone in the Phoenix area!"
5,5,"Amazing!! They had the best price, and I called several places... Ryan was so nice and he called to let me know when he would be here and was ON TIME!! Will be telling all my friends about them!!"
5,5,"Earlier this week somebody kicked up a rock on the freeway and broke my windshield so I sent out several requests for a windshield replacement windshield on Yelp 2 days ago.  

Not only did these guys reply to my online quote request right away, they were the lowest cost for matching OEM glass and, they didn't reply to my online request with a request for me to call them back for the quote, or for me to send them my phone number so they could call ME.  (I hate that.)

Note to all merchants: An online quote should be just that, ONLINE.

I finally finished the online quote discussions with their owner, Matt, and decided to book the appointment with them, and when I did call Matt to schedule the work he was courteous and my appointment was scheduled for the same day.  The technician, Ryan, came to my house and he was on time, efficient and super professional.

Consider me a super satisfied customer."
5,5,"This place is awesome. I came outside and saw my window cracked, I saw the five star review and decided to give it a shot. They set up an appointment for within the hour, and quoted me a price way below what I thought it was going to be (I didn't have glass coverage on my insurance). Ryan came out and did a quick fantastic job. I was happy with the service, attitude and the cost. I would recommend them and definitely use their services again. Great job guys!"
5,5,"Matt and his group are absolutely fantastic!  I was able to call and get same day service.  They were very professional and willing to match a competitors price.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for an exemplary, professional, and honest business."
3,2,"I'd pass on this one, unless you are desperate. We had paid reservations two months in advance for arrival on December 31st. Surprise! office was closed when we arrived at noon and no arrival package was prepared for us. Had to call the emergency number to get someone to show us where our space was. The manager showed up and was nice and helpful. But all of this took time about 35 minutes to get signed in blah, blah, blah.  As with most RV Parks in the Phoenix general area, the Park combines RV spaces with Park Model semi-permanent residences. This is an older park and mixes both uses very close together.  Spaces are paved with fine gravel and are  closer to each other than I am used to. Access roads to the sites are narrow. So if you have a rig longer than 28-30 feet, you are going to have difficulties backing in to your assigned space.  There are no pull-throughs.  Spaces have normal 50/30 Amp electrical, tap water and sewer utilities with a sewer vent on most sites. No TV hook ups and very slow internet connection. Didn't use the bathroom/showers, laundry pool or other amenities."
3,5,"Great RV park with good people and activities...  LIke new Bathroom/Showers, good pool & spa..."
3,1,"FYI this is an ADULT only RV park, which was clarified to be 45+ RV park.... I wish Good Sam noted that on their app. After a long day of driving I had the nice manager inform me that we could not stay because we were in our 30's. I am glad that I now know that I don't reach adulthood for another 15 years at least!"
3,1,"We just stayed there this month and the customer service was horrible, especially Tim the escort. We were first told they couldn't find our reservations and didn't know if they had any sites available, what a joke, there were many empty sites. They blamed it on encore that they didn't know what was going on in the park. It's all about the dollar, we paid $90 to park in dirt and gravel. The first spot we were in was suppose to be pull through, couldn't even get in without unhooking the tow vehicle. This was our second and last stay!"
3,4,"We stayed here for 1 night while in the Phoenix area. We have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. The staff were friendly and check in was quick. They actually assist you with backing in your RV which is really nice. They have a ton of amenities and there always seems to be some kind of event going on. We didn't get to participate because we were there for such a short period, but we would definitely come back here when we have a little more time."
3,4,"I know Yelp is an unusual place to post a review for an RV park but since this place hasn't been reviewed here yet I thought I'd the first. I was so pleased with my stay I wanted to tell others about my experience. I visited Az for springs training and needed to to find an RV park centrally located to several of the baseball stadiums. Mesa spirit is located within 8mi of the 10/60 Frwy interchange and close to the 101 loop. It's very close to Camping World, grocery store and Kmart. I am not a full time RVer or snowbird so I am not familiar with these types of large scale RV resort parks but I am huge fan now. This is not a 55 and over park although it caters to many older adults. This park had many amenities the best of which in my opinion were the very clean and accessible restroom/showers. It has a 9 table billiard parlor, poker room, two huge pools, 4 hot tubs, 6 bbqs, bingo, dance hall, computer room, and lots more at the main club house. The staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The guests and long terms residents were especially friendly and made me feel like one of the regulars. The RV site was clean and roomy.  I am definitely planning on returning back next year for an even longer stay."
3,4,Stayed here 4 nites after readinb positive reviews.  Place is huge and has tons of activities for snowbirds. We encountered many friendly folks.  The rv site was large.  Negativd feedback the wifi which they touted as free did not work.  Other than that large jacuzzis and pools.  Stayed here and toured Apache trail through Superstition Mtns to Roosevelt lake.  Stopped at Bostons Lakeshore Grill and had Reuben sandwich on marble rye wheat.  It was very good.  RV resort was close to the Cubs Spring Training but tickets were sold out the times we wanted to go.  We were in site B120 and we traveled with 2 dogs.  We would stay here again.
3,4,"We are staying here for a month until our apartment comes available. I was impressed with the customer service here. We had a site reserved for a month, but the apartment notified us we had to wait another week. When we asked for another week they were ok with that. They have activities and social clubs here. There is a nice café in the clubhouse. They helped us hook up our RV. The park is well maintained and clean. There is free cable and WiFi. It is difficult to find your way around as the streets are not well marked. This is a nice place to stay. I'm glad we found it."
3,4,"Very nice park, clean and well kept. Mostly a redidence park with spots for short time stays. The pool we used was clean and very well maintained. Work out room at the pool was a bonus. Probably the only downside about this park is where a short timer gets put. I would suggest they centralize an area for overnighters or short timers. The rig behind us I believe was not being used, but all the junk left out along with all the bay doors opened and flapping in the wind was a little disconcerting. Since we belong with Thousand Trails, and this is an Encore park we chose to stay here. I will stay here the next time we go through this way without hesitation."
3,4,"Very nice park.  We stayed for 3 months and had a wonderful experience.  Staff is professional, available and helpful.  Parking spots are nice and easy in/out.  Facilities maintained well and clean.  Lots of activities, but we didn't indulge in those much.  We picked this park because of their dog setup -- several dog runs available throughout the park.  Our two dogs had a great time, made a lot of friends, big and small.  They keep the dog parks clean and tidy.  This park is convenient to grocery store (across the street), bakery (across the street) and several city dog parks. Lots of good restaurants nearby -- try Blue Adobe on Country Club, it rocks (New Mexico cuisine).  We're going back next year."
3,1,"NOTE: This is NOT a big rig friendly R V park. Maybe 30' RV's or trailers. The ""one star"" applies to BIG RIGS only. The resort has very narrow streets with very narrow pads and over 90% back in pads with very few pull throughs. We (40' RV) were assigned a 45' X 13' gravel pad (measured the pad) that prohibited us from extending our slide out because the neighbors car was parked correctly on his parking pad. Check out Google map / Google Earth before making a reservation. It appears the resort is old with narrow streets and small pads and has not been updated to handle big rigs."
5,5,"I needed to replace my windshield after two large cracks appeared on my window. I jumped on Yelp to research local companies and contacted several (probably 10) to quote a cash replacement for my car. I received numerous quotes in different ranges from $200-$380. I wasn't sure why there was such a difference in cost between all the companies. I called Method to ask about their quote and Hannah was so nice and informative explaining the process. I told her she was the lowest quote I had received and I asked why that was true. She answered all my questions and even offered to come out that very day for the repair! 

I scheduled my appointment for the very next day for them to come to my office. Alan called me in the morning to tell me he would be there around noon. He showed up early (which was awesome) and told me it would be about 30 minutes. I really was surprised, I know I'm a newbie to windshield replacement but it takes longer then 30 minutes to get your car washed! Alan was very professional, fast, and super helpful (he even offered to repair another part on my car that had been broken for months. I really hope I don't have to get another windshield replaced but I know exactly who I'll call if I have to, thanks so much!"
5,5,"Alan came right to my apartment and replaced my cracked windshield. He was professional, efficient and I couldn't believe how affordable it all was. Thanks Alan I'll definitely be calling back if it cracks again!"
5,5,"I had a really bad crack on my windshield and there are so many different glass places in the area I had no idea who to go to.  I started asking around and a few of my friends had tried Method Glass and said they had received a really great price and great customer service.  I called and told them about my car and they were able to come out same day and get my windshield replaced.  I always give things a few days to make sure that I truly am happy with the service I received, and I truly am.  They even followed up with me.  I will use Method Glass again in the future for any problems that I have with glass on my car and I recommend that you try them out as well."
5,5,"If you have a trailer of any kind, this is the place to bring it for high quality work, very reasonable rates, and EXPERT consultation. I called, came in, and two workers jumped on my boat trailer, and  completed the job in 15 minutes.

Call them! This is the way business should be done. I saved them in my phone contacts and I will be back to use them again."
5,5,"Have taken all my trailers there for past few years- welding, axels, repacks, tires. Best price and best quality tires. 2 brothers that own the business. do great work, great pricing always fair. get it done fast. always done on time."
5,5,"What a gem, tucked away on MacDonald. I arrived before they were open and was pleased to see ample street parking and nice wide streets. I'm new to towing this trailer and was relieved to see that I could easily park out front and wait--no hassles.

Neil couldn't have been more helpful, courteous, and professional. And when I returned later, and had trouble backing up to the hitch ball.....Neil and his coworker jumped right in and didn't let me struggle.

I went to RTW for a repack of the bearings and for a second chain. Neil cut the very long chain I had into two pieces, did some welding, attached the ""new"" second chain to the trailer and saved me some $.

Very pleased with the work he did, his pricing, and the work ethic at RTW. I will return."
5,5,"This company is hands down, up, or anyway you want it the BEST trailer repair shop in the metro area.  We called them yesterday with an emergency with our work trailer.
Literally dragged it in, told us he'd call us today for an update, said he try to get it done ASAP! 

He didn't let us down--dropped it off at 1:30 on Tuesday, called us 9:30am the next day said it was finished. Price was great as well, very fair. The work exceptional, couldn't have asked for more! So happy we found them!!Thanks guys, you put my business back on the road!"
5,5,"I brought my 2007 Nordic Trailer into RTW after a blown tire caused damage to the fender and needed repair and paint. I also requested a tune-up and inspection due to the fact that the trailer was just purchased. Neil Rucker, his brother and his team did an outstanding job and were very helpful the price was very reasonable and they did everything with the boat on the Trailer. I absolutely recommend them for help with your trailer!"
5,5,"These guys did a great job reinforcing my boat trailer and welding the cracked areas back together. Hopefully, I won't need their services again but if I do, I can count on them!"
5,5,"I have worked with Rucker since 2012 for all of my boat trailer maintenance and repairs. There service, response time, and expertise is the best in the valley. I would recommend them for all of your requirements for trailer repair and maintenance!"
5,5,"Called these guys looking for an axle hub. They were knowledgeable and helpful. Then when I showed up to pick up the hub, they were able to talk me through the details of various hubs that other people had put on my trailer over the years. 
Friendly, professional, knowledgeable. Great service. Much appreciated!"
5,5,They did a stellar job with the install on my Nissan Frontier. So clean and well placed. All wiring done perfectly and no issues at all. Thanks guys!
4,5,"My wife and I were looking for a RV at a reasonable cost stopped at Robert Crist and was met by Tony Maxwell he walked us around the lot giving us excellent information, it was our first stop of the day and told him so at the beginning but he was excellent, told us about a RV show that was going on that weekend, on the way there we stopped at other RV lots and lucky we didn't stop at them first they seemed like they could of cared we were even there so we went to the RV show and meet  Nick also a Robert Crist salesman, again excellent we ended up buying a RV at the show and every step of the way Tony Maxwell was there to see us thru the process, made the whole buying experience much more enjoyable. Thank you Tony and Nick"
4,5,"We were so very impressed with the entire staff at Robert Crist.  From our salesperson Guy Kasper, who came in to ensure that everything was in order the day of our delivery, the Sales Manager Bryan who worked with us on our final price, the Service Department staff, Norm and Michael Tyler, Daryl, and a sweet cashier who provided advice in the additional needs that we had, to Ryan Hawkins the Business Manager.  We felt that they truly wanted us to have a wonderful experience with our new trailer.  They have exceeded our expectations as a business."
4,5,"Took our RV in for warranty work. Desert autoplex is where we bought it however, they were rude, disrespectful, and untimely when it came to service. This also included their service manage so we went to Robert Christ. They were kind, timely, found issues that desert autoplex didn't, fixed what desert autoplex didn't, and all the time with smiles and courtesy. They were up front about issues regarding money and were very concerned when it came to a health safety issue that was identified. Highly recommend their service department! Call early though, they fill up quick. Had to wait 3 weeks to get in. That tells you how good they are because they are booked up"
4,5,Dale was so great at my walk through. He helped me tremendously and made the experience awesome!
4,5,"Exceptional! Having come from an outstanding dealership/service department in Kent, Washington it has been very difficult finding a dealership here in Mesa, AZ.
 We needed a full service on the coach, including the generator. Crist RV got us in very quickly and the work was done as promised at the estimate provided. During the free, umpteen point inspection the tech found 2 extra items that needed attention. Both were performed flawlessly!
 There have been several other things we have wanted done and those services also were done above and beyond expectations!
 While our part of Arizona has a ton (!) of motor coach/RV  places, it is almost impossible to find a dealership that does it all and does it right. 
 The other ""plus"" is that the area to drop off and pick up your rig is roomy and off of the main road. It allows for easy drop and hook up of a towed car...nice!"
4,5,"We went to Robert Crist to purchase our new Open Range Roamer. From the beginning of our shopping experience with Ryan right through to our purchase with Robert Crist Jr. , every question we had was answered, all the papers were thoroughly explained and the whole experience was smooth. We had a small change done in the trailer, Mike handled that and was very responsive. He arranged to have Dale deliver our trailer when our new truck took longer than we expected to arrive. We can't say enough about this company. We felt valued as customers and look forward to a long business relationship to Robert Crist and Company!"
4,5,"I can't say enough good things about this place. No pressure and all the sales associated make you feel like family and not just another customer. They even went out of their way to make sure there was always burgers and hotdogs available to customers while they shopped or waited. They went out of their way to give my 3 year old water, oranges, and balloons! Their customer service is what sold us on this dealership. Our sales associate Tom was very knowledgeable and outstanding! He really went above and beyond to make sure we had the ultimate customer experience. Can't wait to get on the road and make memories thanks to Tom and the rest of the staff at Robert Crist."
4,5,"Loved the salesman we worked with, I can't remember his name unfortunately, but he was very low pressure and happy to show us around to look at 20 RV's and decide what we were most interested in. We went to all the lots in Mesa and this one seemed to have the best selection and prices."
3,5,Buying a trailer from trailer + was a great experience they were helpful set up the trailer the way I wanted to and I'm very happy
3,1,"TRAILER MINUS 
I bought a trailer, Curt hitch and curt ball joint. Had it all installed by trailer plus one year ago and drove it 1200 miles from Phoenix to Seattle, went over a speed bump and the trailer popped off the hitch, so I thought I broke it myself. So I parked it and left it till I had the time and money to fix it so I Brought it to this store recently to get the trailer fixed but Come to find out they installed in Phoenix a 1 7/8 ball joint, the trailer required a 2"" (This store even charged me for a new ball joint SHAMEFUL!!!) I called their corporate office and they lie to me and tell me they don't sell Curt ball joints? I bought a Curt hitch? So I guess I just brought a ball joint from them then took it off put a smaller one on on purpose then loaded my two small children right behind the trailer with a couple of thousand pounds behind them and drove it for a couple of states? I called them to see if they would help me fix the scratches on the back of the vehicle that were caused by the trailer sliding into it when it popped off, I'm not even asking for any money for when it popped off the hitch while I was unloading and fell scuffing and bruising my shoulder or the risk my children took, or even when it popped off at 55 miles an hour and I was able to slow down with it chained to my vehicle, I still have trouble driving with the trailer cause I can't focus on the road, I can't stop looking in my mirror fearing it will pop off... so if you want to buy from this company and have an issue you have been warned!"
3,5,"Gavin and the sales people were so helpful with my effort to get some trailer parts. I can't say enough about how helpful and professional they all were.

I'm telling you it's been a long time that I've received that type of service. It ranks up there with the best ever.

Much appreciated everyone at trailersplus. You really go the extra mile in customer service!"
3,3,"Not Great Prices, Difficult To Do Business With 

I saw a trailer sale and wanted to pickup a car hauler quick on my way out of town. So I made the journey across the land to a place of trailer selling.....

I arrived to a difficult access entrance off Indian school as google maps directed me to. I see the sign which says they open at 10am on tuesdays and nobody is here and the gate is locked at 1pm. Even a truck driver is here with a load of trailers to deliver and nobody answers the phone or seems around!

So finally the truck driver got someone to answer the phone and let us in. 

The assistant manager told me they were closed until 3pm because ""corporate told us not to open until 3"" and told me to see the manager. 

I went inside and the manager apologized for my wait and told me they were closed for lunch. He seemed like a friendly enough sales guy.

We looked at the trailer I truly felt the quality level was not there. I own several PJ brand trailers and felt these were not the same quality level at all. The new 2017 trailer was showing rust at seams and had a less robust framework and just felt a bit light weight. 

All in all the quality is just not there and the prices show a huge savings from an inflated ""Original Price"" is an artificial ploy at making you feel there is a deal. 

I'd recommend looking at PJ, Load Master or Big Tex instead."
3,1,Went here to look for a trailer. The place is closed to the public except by appointment only 5 days out of the week and closed the other 2. Saw people walking around and wouldn't even take the time to talk to me through the fence. Info about appointment only would be nice on web site. Took my business else where.
3,1,"You'll get the run around here. We walked in on a Tuesday, ready to buy a trailer. We put a hold on the trailer we wanted and returned the next day at the time we informed them we'd be back and they still had to verify the trailer was operational, as well as inspect MY vehicle to assure it could tow an empty 6x10 foot cargo trailer. I have a 3/4 ton truck. Of course it can haul a small cargo trailer. 

When we were done playing the run around game with a sales associate that was apparently still in training, we walked out. A manager's parting words were that we wouldn't find a better trailer. 

Well, we drove up the road to Deer Valley Trailer, and bought a 6x12 cargo trailer with a foot more headroom. 

The only good part about walking out of there was when we arrived at Deer Valley Trailer, the couple who had left Trailer's Plus as we walked in were wrapping up a sale on a trailer, and after we bought our trailer, we realized another customer who had walked into Trailer's Plus as we were leaving had also ended up at Deer Valley Trailer! 

They lost three customers today (3/23/16) and we saved $300 and got ourselves a bigger trailer with a better warrantee!"
5,5,"We needed a hitch, and our mechanic suggested we go here.  Called them up, sure enough, they had the one we needed, so we made an appointment for the next day.  I walked in, and half an hour(-ish) later, walked out with the new hitch installed.  It really was as easy as that.  Very helpful, knew exactly what we needed and did the work promptly."
5,5,These guys are really great. I called in advance to make an appointment to have a trailer hitch installed on my Volvo wagon. They ordered the parts in advance and were johnny on the spot getting to work on my car as soon as I arrived. The staff was very polite and helpful. I was in and out within an hour even though they did my wiring as well. Very pleased with their service and I'll be back with my other vehicles.
5,5,"My dad and I were in a tough situation with a faulty trailer hitch that needed a lighting harness to be attached and were trying to make a drive that day with a uhaul trailer. We were desperate to find a place and tried about 6 places that told us either they couldn't help us or we'd have to make an appointment for another day. 
I called A&M and they were so helpful and knew what I was talking about right away and told me to come in ASAP and they'd help us out. It took less than 30 min and the staff was super friendly and professional. Overall, 10/10 would recommend and would definitely go back for any truck/trailer assistance. Thanks!!!"
5,5,"I had the guys here install my trailer hitch.  They did a good job.

Came back a few months later and had them install a Retrax Pro truck bed cover.  I thought it was well priced and they did a good job installing the cover.

I could have bought the bed cover from Amazon but shipping is a pain and if it is damaged, the return process is a drag for something this large.  So, I chose to let a dealer do it.  It was fast and simple.

I will take my trailer here when it needs service."
5,5,I was in Arizona in May of 2017.  My boyfriend and I were planning our 1st road trip with our 5th wheel. I pre made reservations. Once we got here in September... we are so satisfied with the resort we are planning our trip for next year.
5,5,Great local and family business! Tom and Angela are a pleasure to work with and gave us a great RV to rent for the week while we took it to Burning Man. Every time we had a question on the functionality of the RV they were always available over the phone and even called back just to check in on things. When we returned it a little dirtier than we expected and they said it wasn't a problem- even gave us our full deposit back as well. A pleasant experience and would recommend them to anyone.
4,5,Top notch mechanics! The owner Lonnie will go above and beyond to help you.
4,5,I show dogs and travel in a very expensive motor home. Dynamic Diesel fixed it promptly and was done right unlike the previous place I took it to in another state. They got me back on the road quickly.
2,1,"I called the store in Mesa looking for a specific part, before I completed my sentence, I was transferred to ""products"". The phone rang in intervals of 15 rings, would then get picked up, by I'm assuming the 1st person I spoke with, only to be placed on hold again for another 15 rings.  The phone rang 135 times, before I was hung up on."
2,2,The service part person was rude and had a bad attitude.  We will go to the Internet for parts next time rather than making the drive. The two stars was for the nice selection of things in the store.
2,1,"We stopped in to Camping World of Mesa to see some RVs we'd researched. Parked the truck, began to wander around the RVs along the street fence. After a bit, a salesman (Mark Purdy) pulls up in a golf cart (110 outside), tells us to get in & asks what we're looking for. We told him upfront that we were just starting to look, and you could see the lights in his head/any interest turn off! When I told him we were looking at a particular brand's Palazzo & Challenger models -- which we were looking at near the fence -- he corrects me on the pronunciation of Palazzo, so I corrected him back, telling him it's pronounced differently in Italy. He then makes fun of my comment to a coworker as we're driving by him. (Really?!?!) Then, while we were looking at an RV, one of his coworkers took the cart we were in & drove away with our stuff still inside! (What the heck?!) Got everything back, but still...

Since we had specific features we're looking for, Mark turned around & drove back to *where we started*, unlocked the coaches & left us there to look. He did not check back with us.

Since we'd never been to Camping World before, this was a first impression shot at a potential customer -- and they blew it!!! We won't even consider buying ANYTHING from this place! You lost not only our business, but that of anyone we tell about you."
2,1,"Worst customer service you'll ever find in any industry, anywhere.  Terrible.  Go anywhere else."
2,1,"I just called to ask a question about repair work and the lady was rude and says you will have to bring the whole unit in. I said Thank you and she just hangs up
Also everytime we go in at the back service desk they are also rude and not much help. They will order a part and have you pay for it but then you have to go way elsewhere to pick up the part. We said we will just buy the part where we have to pick it up."
2,4,"Went to Camping World 2 days ago, had to pick up a few things for the rv. The customer service and pricing at Camping World is excellent. I would this place."
2,5,"UNBELIEVABLE!!!  The best experience EVER!!  We went to another company and they were, to say the least, difficult to work with. This Camping World was so easy to work with. Larry Lovett worked with us and brought other people in to make sure we got the deal we wanted. So painless."
2,2,"I took a chance on these guys even with all the negative reviews posted on yelp. I kept thinking I had to go with a chain store in case I ever needed warranty work while traveling, but this location is really struggling in the service repair business. I'm new to the RV service culture being a new owner, but do not understand why they need to keep my vehicle for three weeks before they even get to the diagnosis? Seems like I could just keep my vehicle and bring it in when they are ready to actually work on the repair. I was given a date when they would get to the repair and the date came and went with no communication. A few days later I reached out to them...numerous times...before I finally got my estimate for the repair. I had a small piece that needed to be repaired in my awning and I was told I needed a completely brand new awning. I'm going to shop around more for an estimate as I'm perplexed this piece can't be replaced. I had them add some support straps to the plumbing and that repair was fine. However, due to the lack of communication and going far beyond what I was told when I would get my vehicle back I would avoid these guys."
2,2,The jury is out on the service department at the Mesa camping world. They just opened recently so they deserve a break. My first several encounters are not extremely positive but I expect that will turn around I hope
2,1,"Omg! Beware. The first day we went this young guy didn't want to doing work for us. Such as talk about our trade in or what financing was available. We found a trailer that we liked. But, we left because the salesman was bad. We, went back two days later and got a different salesman. This time he was willing to work with us. What a joke. Our trade in is worth between $28,000.00 to $34,000.00. They told us they would pay off our trailer. The trailer we wanted was $57,140.00. The best the could do was $693.00 a month for 180 months. Figure that out! Over 180 months that's over $124,000.00 ya right! Ya, they where trying to stick us with like an $80,000.00 long story short they will rip you off! Our son bought a trailer at Camping World in Avondale. Charged him double sales tax! When he confronted them the basically said to bad! Professional Rip Off Artist! Just be very careful! Look other places! Better deals out there!"
2,1,"We went through their internet service for our RV.  Jaimee was great, she found us what we wanted and had it shipped.  Then the problems began.  When they shipped the RV they did not include the keys or manuals.  We have been calling/emails their service department for 3 weeks now.  They keep telling us they received them but ""can't find them"" so then they promised they would re-key and send us all the manuals - as well as finish some of the warranty work.  As of today we have still not been able to get ahold of them.  We can't lock our RV up because we only have one key that will only work on the front door.  I will never purchase anything from them (not even toilet paper).  We have never had bad service from Camping World."
2,1,"I purchased a Thor Tuscany AT 45 on Oct 10, 2015.  I was told that service through a Camping World Store is the best because they give you THE ELITE card.  Do not in anyway believe this nonsense.  I went to a local Camping World in Vacaville, CA and I was put at the end of the line.  There is not such thing as Elite service.  We had to wait 4 weeks for an appointment, and then we were told that they would not do the delivery work as it was not their store.  Also, the warranty work that needed to be done was another BIG issue as well.  We had to leave coach their 3 to 7 days just to determine what the warranty work was, then they would contact Thor and get permission to do the work.  All told the coach would be in their hands for 2 to 3 weeks.
Do not believe a word the salesman tell you regarding Elite Status.  It is not true.  OR other branches do not consider it a priority.  Either way I would never recommend buying from Camping World.  I did get a good deal, but what is a good deal if the selling dealer will not return telephone calls or letters regarding these issues.  If I had it to do over, I would NEVER purchase from CAMPING WORLD."
2,1,"Do not go here for service ! It was suppose to cost $40 to install Led Light Strip, something I could have done myself if I wasn't disabled. There final cost was over $400."
2,1,"Seriously how is this place still in operation? I went in the other day to get some Honda oil for my generator and while checking out the cashier was pretty much telling me I was a chump for buying factory brand oil and that any old oil would do...?!?!? First, that's just absolutely, positively not true! Second, don't belittle someone about buying a product that the company you work for sells!! MARCUS LEMONIS stop worrying about your stupid tv show and save the business your freakin CEO of!"
2,5,"Fabulous Experience.  Things were explained, demonstrated so I could understand what they were - I'm a total newly at this and they were okay with it!  Our sales person David Roy was the absolute best.  If you go, see Dave and tell him I sent you.  If you buy from David, he'll send me a gift card to spend in their Camping World Store!  And you know, with a new toy there's so many things you need for it!"
2,5,"I wanted to express my sincerest appreciation for outstanding customer service to Tina and Leeann who went above and beyond the call fo duty for making sure the customer was well taken care of.  Way to go, you both, made me want to come back to Camping World and purchase more product!

Great job to you both,
Mike Kenney"
2,1,"do not take your rv there....especially if it's an older model....they are rude, unprofessional and left a voicemail on my husband's phone saying they don't want our business!!!  so bye bye!  nobody should bring them business then!  what jerks!!!!!!!!!"
2,1,"Well, I'm climbing on the ""don't use Camping World for RV repairs"" bandwagon. We went to Camping World on June 27th and met Robert Dealy, a very nice Service Advisor.  We told him the repairs needed for our RV and he gave us an appointment for 2 weeks later on July 12th.  When we arrived on the 12th we met Matthew, another very nice Service Advisor.  Matthew walked through the RV with my husband to see what needed to be done, took pictures of the RV and wrote up the service order.  We were told it should be ready that Friday but Robert would call to confirm.  When we didn't hear from Robert by Thursday we decided to take a ride to talk to him in person.  When we arrived we drove out to the back and low and behold, there was our RV in the dirt lot waiting for service.  We drove around to the service department and asked Robert what was going on and how much longer will it take.  He spoke with the Service dispatcher and she said that she would get it in later in the day and start the diagnostic.  Robert said he would give a call the next day but we didn't hear from him so, again we drove down, and again the RV was in the same exact spot never moved.  We drove over to service and spoke with a different Service Advisor, again very nice.  He called back to the dispatcher and she said the RV was in the bay and had been dispatched to the service tech and he would be working on it shortly, REALLY??? How is that going to happen when we just saw it in the dirt lot! Once we heard that we just said give us the keys we'll take it somewhere else.  Now we don't mind leaving any of our vehicles at a service place but being outright lied to is something we can't stand for.  This review is in no way to say that the Service Advisors are to blame for this lack of service.  It falls on the responsibility of the Service Manager to get his team organized.  If you're that busy that your service techs resort to lying to the customer, hire more people.  Camping World Mesa, AZ is overworked and understaffed."
2,1,I find it ironic that Camping World is a colossal failure of a business while their CEO has a TV show that's about fixing broken businesses...
2,1,I purchased my RV from this location and it broke down on the way home. I took the RV back and they said they replaced the problems but I've had this same problem numerous times.  They sold me a lemon and refused to fix it or remedy the issue in any way.  Do not go to this place they are scammers they will take your money and give you junk and have no Conscience about it. I understand businesses are in it to make money but I don't think that they should take people on a ride and scam them there's an honest way to make money and they are not going about it the right way.
2,1,"I took the family to look at new TT's since our hybrid was starting to get too small for us.  I was skeptical since I had some previous insurance work done on my existing RV at the service center and was less than a thrilled with how that went.  Anyhow, I spoke with the salesperson JEANA. She started off nice and drove us around in her golf cart showing us some different models. Mind you, this was on a Sunday at about 330 and they closed at 5. So about 45 minutes after showing us about 6-8 models JEANA starts to become a little pushy and wants to make a sale. I CLEARLY explained to her I was not interested in buying today as I wanted to discuss all options with my wife (price, features, etc). I didn't think it was too much to ask before I drop 30K on a TT.  

So now JEANA is clearly peeved I'm not buying today and I ask her if I could get some pamphlets on the models we saw. She directed us to her office and placed 2 papers on her desk. One for me and one for my wife. She wanted all of our information to enter us into a $1000 Camping World giveaway.  My wife very politely said, ""No thanks, I don't want to fill this out"" which was also my sediment. No joke, JEANA looked at us and said , ""Really? I spent all that time with you and you can't even give me your information?""  Then she pointed to the brochure rack and said the brochures are over there and walked away. Not a ""it was nice to meet you"" or ""please come back and see me when you're ready"" or ""here's my card, call me if you have any questions"". NOPE!  It was get the fudge out, I'm done with you!  I was absolutely blown away that a sales rep would EVER, no matter the situation act like that to a potential customer. DO NOT IGNORE ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS.  THEY ARE SPOT ON!  THIS PLACE BLOWS!"
2,5,Didn't realize that this was more than just a dealer.  They also have parts and service and a little store inside.  Found that there were lots of people here to help.  We'll definitely call this location again in the future when trying to track down parts.
2,5,"Incredible and efficient employees! We came in, told them what we wanted and how much we wanted to pay for our new toy hauler and they exceeded expectations! We we're out of there in 2 days with our trailer. Everyone was so nice and helpful. We'll be recommending to everyone we know."
2,1,"Seriously how is this place still in operation? I went in the other day to get some Honda oil for my Honda generator and while checking out the cashier was pretty much telling me I was a chump for buying factory brand oil and that any old oil would do...?! First off, that's just absolutely not true! Second, don't belittle someone about buying a product that the company you work for sells!! MARCUS LEMONIS stop worrying about your stupid tv show and save the business you're freakin CEO of!"
2,1,"Purchased a 2005 5th wheel trailer. I totally understand 'as is', however, I had issues from the moment I hooked up. The fridge would not work properly, washer leaks and the new kitchen faucet was hooked up backwards.  After taking approximately 3 days to try to resolve the problem with the fridge, plus being a weekend, I called the Camping World. Another three days pass as I was not getting called back. When I was called back, I was told it would be $259 just to for the trip charge. Again I totally understand 'as is' a month 6 months down the road but from the time of delivery! The service manager finally called me back, after I had to call back twice due to calls not being returned, He stuck to the service department s quote $259 plus whatever it took to fix it. I explained my frustration as, this is a lot of money to me, he just said he could give me a number for a mobile RV person who would be cheaper.
Very poor customer service. (There were other problems during the purchasing process with lack of communication as well)
 I will not be recommending this Camping World in the future"
2,1,Sold me a membership with a promised rebate coupon of 25.00. After staying in a campground that qualified I mailed in the coupon. Six months and several calls to Good Sam Club Never received the rebate. Will not continue doing business with these Fraudulent company's
2,1,"I truly believe if I threw a bucket full of 100.00 bills at them, they would throw it back! Tried for months to buy a carry out sat dome that was sitting in their warehouse due to a ""computer glitch"" and finally bought one from the guy who moved into their old space and he had it on the shelf! Last week I was in PA 2000 miles from home and tried to get emergency service on my front end through that annoying lady on the web site who pops up and was not helped AT ALL!  Good thing Mesa has about 100 dealers to choose from ! You can see the meltdown from the posts here that started good and are now ALL bad!"
2,1,"These people are the rudest people I have ever encountered. They all need to take a customer service class. Their hours say they're open until 6:00pm, but 2 times now I've shown up 5 minutes before closing and the doors were already locked. Today I had to beg the guy to let me in, as I knew exactly what I needed. As soon as I walked in an older blonde haired lady said, and I quote ""how did you get in here?"" Really? How rude. You just lost a customer for life - I won't ever set foot in this store again!"
2,1,"We had a negative experience at Camping World regarding our potential RV purchase on April 10, 2013.

The Camping World we visited was in Mesa, Arizona (2222 E Main st., Mesa, AZ).
We were working with sales person RYAN. (Young Caucasian with furr on his teeth)

RYAN found a used RV that came in on trade that he thought we may be interested in. Camping World hadn't gotten the unit yet, but we were told we could view the used RV soon. To have Camping World's salesman hold the unit for us- he recommended we put a refundable hold deposit of $1000 down, and Ryan (The furry toothed salesman) assured us the deposit was refundable. We also hadn't actually looked at the RV yet, but thought the RV could be a potentially great unit to buy- so we left the $1000 refundable sight unseen deposit.

For personal reasons, we elected to continue our RV search and asked to get our refundable deposit returned.

Obtaining our refundable deposit did not go so smoothly!  I went to Camping World to thank Furry Toothed RYAN for his time, but we decided to take our REFUNDABLE $1000 DEPOSIT back and continue our RV search. This is when RYAN collaborated with his unprofessional Money Hungry Sales Manager to notify him that I was there to get back our deposit and release the hold on the RV we hadn't seen and continue our RV search. This is where these bogus money hungry salesmen began to RAZZ me, a Female Client. Rudely interrogating me with comments like ""Why do you want your deposit back... We've spent a lot of time locating this RV for you""... Then proceeded to laugh at me like a load of overweight hyenas when I stated that we are simply going to continue our search for the perfect RV for our family and that we would like our refundable deposit back.  I am embarrassed with Camping World, and the Mesa, Arizona Camping World Team should be ashamed of themselves.

I followed up with our furry toothed salesman RYAN via email to share our camping world experience.

I'd like to add that RYAN proclaimed to my hubby (over the phone on April 16, 2013) that him and the sales team were rude to me and interrogated me because they were frustrated on their end because they spent a lot of time locating RV's for us to look at. (Um hey dirtbags, we were shopping for the perfect RV for us, we weren't in the market to just buy something y'all ""worked so hard to find""... Get a real job lazy schmucks, locating an RV on a computer isn't rocket science.)

I'd like to respond to RYAN by saying that his frustrations are very trivial compared to what we have to manage on a daily basis. I'd also like to explain to RYAN and the Mesa, AZ Camping World Sales Team that asking for our refundable deposit, whatever the reason, doesn't call for disrespect and interrogation of a female client.

We were looking to purchase a new fifth wheel RV, and were not desperate to just buy anything. We have a very unique living situation, and we were preparing to spend 10's of thousands of dollars on a new RV- and when making this decision, we weren't going to make a purchase until we found the fifth wheel of our liking. A fifth wheel that we love, 100%.

After putting down a refundable depoit on a used fifth wheel that we hadn't actually looked at- we decided to continue on with our search for a new fifth wheel.

Camping World's Sales Team in Mesa, Arizona were so desperate to make a sale, that they literally disrespected and interrogated me when I told them we elected to take our refundable deposit back- and continue our search for the perfect RV for our family.

This is unacceptable, and I certainly do not appreciate my experience with Camping World.

I'd strongly advise buyers to be aware of this when choosing to Shop for RV's at the Mesa, AZ Camping World."
2,5,"We worked with Nate in the service department and he was absolutely awesome. He kept us informed of progress and if he didn't have an answer for us, he found us someone who could."
2,2,"Unbelievable how the employees that work in the front part of the store can be so nice and helpful, but the guys that work behind the counter in the back  (parts?) can be such assholes. When we need to buy something for our trailer, we avoid the back of the store at all costs."
2,1,"Avoid this place if at all possible. There are plenty of other options in the Mesa/Phoenix area and no one  needs to be treated with such disrespect.  I have never been in there when the men employees are helpful at all!!  One cashier was great to help out, but no one before or since. Go across the street to RV Renovators for parts and excellent customer service!!!"
2,4,"Bought a travel trailer at a dealership in Tucson, but CW will service it under the two year warranty. We took the trailer in for warranty repairs at the end of season last year as well as in November of 2017.  Erich in the service department did a great job of communicating with me throughout the process.  Starcraft took forever in some cases to approve repairs, but that had nothing to do with CW.  I would use CW again for repairs if I knew Erich would be the service adviser."
2,1,"I would give them a 5 if I were reviewing the awesome support I got from the regional service Director. I went to the main street location to have repairs done on my motorhome. Bottom line, the communication was awful. The tech who works with you did not communicate with me. The repair tech did repairs that a 10 year old would do. The workmanship and quality of repairs was way below standards. After nearly having my rv a month, I found many things not fixed, the carpet was all greasy from walking all over it with greasy shoes. Never did clean. I had to do it myself. Service manager a joke, he was told everything and basically, disregarded my concerns. Basically backed his staff. Very incompetent. Had to have the repairs corrected at La Mesa Rv. The only shining experience was the great communication style from the Regional Service Director, Russ Hunt. A quality individual with great communication skills. Listened to my concerns. Said he'd take care of me. And Mr. Russ followed though and made all his promises come true. He took care of the repair bill and I would highly recommend that if you ever need someone with Professionalism, Great Customer service skills, Seek out Mr. Russ. He proved that great people do still reside at Camping World when you need them. Bill"
2,1,Please heed the reviews... no need to add any more comments. RUN!!!!!
2,1,"Went in to buy a new Pullrite Automatic fifth wheel hitch for my truck. Dave was real helpful and contacted me with pricing the ""next day"". I thought of checking with two others local businesses for pricing and delivery before Dave got back to me.  Glad I did.  Guess what Camping World even with my GS discount was 15% higher then both of the local dealers.   The local dealers delivery and installation dates were both one day and Camping World ""hoped""to have it in a week.  Not Good...So much for big box stores being able to help you better."
2,1,This place is full of the rudest most useless unhappy don't want to help you go screw yourself employees I have ever seen. I signed up for their membership and I will simply write that off as a lost because I will go ANYWHERE else than this crap hole.
2,1,"Lets not overlook that this place is way overpriced, how about the fact that my husband and I were looking for a used camper and were not helped. We stepped outside where the golf carts were and walked around for a bit in 110 degree weather with nothing but asphalt and black shoes. A salesman drive up and took us to the farthest part of the lot, helped us for 5 minutes then got on his cart and said he had another  appointment and drove off!! Walking back my shoes burned into my feet and I suffered heat stroke! DO NOT go here!"
2,1,"We took our motor home into the service department for shocks and a new steering stabilizer installed which all started about 3 months ago. After ordering wrong parts 3 times, and then the right parts were lost, we finally got the job done. David was our service advisor and did an awesome job of keeping on top of this disaster. We made at least five trips there because we had picked up and dropped odd the RV several times. Two trips were because they can't seem to answer the phone and they even claim voice mail messages were not received. The voicemail system is a piece of crap too. 
We finally picked up the RV yesterday where I asked their parts manager, LARS MEYERS, for a much deserved discount because of all the hassle and multiple trips we made, 45 min each way. He said they do not give discounts for any reason and did not apologize for any of the troubles we encountered. He was an absolute PRICK. The rudest man I have ever met. They do not care a bit about customer service. I will never go back there for anything. Everything they have can be ordered elsewhere, and a lot cheaper on Amazon. Hats off to David for working for this jerk. I am calling the owner to complain as well."
2,1,I recently wen't to camping world thinking of trading in my RV and purchasing a new one. They bait you into their office and then switch pricing and terms on you last minute. The pressure they placed on us was uncomfortable and then they became rude when they tried to trick us out of our original agreement. I would suggest you stay away and take your business elsewhere.
2,1,"My husband and I had the most unprofessional and unethical experience with this dealership. We spent hours negotiating for a toy hauler and got passed back and forth between Ryan and the Sales Manager who was prone to telling his customers off for making what they considered to be reasonable offers. In the end we ran credit and entered into an agreement to purchase a toy hauler that was sitting in Camping World, ABQ New Mexico. Mesa's Camping World took our $5,000 deposit and entered it into their system and since this was a Sunday afternoon asked us to come back on Monday to complete the balance of the paperwork. They indicated that they would courier the toy hauler papers from New Mexico to Mesa and agreed to split costs with us on driving the toy hauler from NM to Tucson Arizona where we could pick it up. 

Monday rolled around and the update from Camping World was no papers yet and that they were trying to find a driver. Tuesday rolls around and still no papers or update. Late in the day a call comes in from the local Sales Manager to say the District Manager took a look at the deal, decided there was no profit in it for them and advised they were cancelling the transaction and refunding our $5,000. We also received a call from the District Manager with the same comment that there was no money in it for them and they weren't doing the deal they had agreed to in the dealership. We got an anonymous text message hours later to say the $5,000 refund had been processed but still waited another four days before we saw the money back in our account. 

I called Ryan on Monday and Tuesday and he was not available. He has never attempted to do any follow up with us ..... not even a gee sorry. So now we have credit run on what is an impeccable credit record in the 800's ... and we have nothing to show for it. We've had $5,000 taken out of our savings that took the best part of the week to get back and we've communicated with Jayco about the less than ethical behavior of this dealer.

Apart from that the search for our luxury toy hauler continues. As we go we ensure we tell our story and warn everyone about Camping World.  I would advise anyone to take a wide berth around these folk."
2,1,"My husband called their service department 2 and a half weeks ago and left 2 voice mails with Lexi to call him back to schedule a service.  We are still waiting on a call back.  He gave his cell phone number and waited 24 hours between phone calls and nothing.  Called a 3rd time and told the operator what was going on and she said she would run the message out to Lexi and have her call - no call.  Took the RV to a competitor and we are extremely happy with their communication and service.  This is not the first time we have not been called back.  Last summer we needed a part and so left a message with the part's department - still waiting to hear back.  Ordered the part from a competitor who even sent the part to us over night because they knew how crucial it was to get the repair done.  Guess Camping World has enough business that they don't need ours except for shopping at the store.  Shame because they previously repaired our RV and did a great job, but after not being called back we won't go there again for parts or repairs."
2,1,"They advertise sale prices but you have to pay $25 membership to get the price! Went in to buy a portable camp fire, retailing at 134.99, they jacked it up to $138 with savings, and $185 without the membership. Even called before hand and they said they had two in stock and they were $130. What a joke! They also charged more than retail on the other items I was there to buy as well. Shame on you CAMPING WORLD!  I went to SPORTSMAN WAREHOUSE instead and found what we were looking for."
2,1,"Lets not overlook that this place is way overpriced, how about the fact that my husband and I were looking for a used camper and were not helped.

Walking back my shoes burned into my feet and I suffered heat stroke! DO NOT go here!"
2,1,"I wrote a review earlier this month but did not give an explanation as to why I gave Camping World such a low rating.
I purchased a 22 Ft. Travel trailer In March of 2016. The salesman at first was very nice and I'm not saying He is a bad individual but the fact is He makes money on commission. 
I took about a week getting my down payment in order and as time went on I got the impression that it was urgent for him to make a sale. Next I went to finance and everyone there was nice until my insurance co. was slow producing proof of insurance to the loan company. Then I received phone calls one after the other explaining that the loan company was holding the payoff to Camping world until they received proof of insurance. It took 4 or 5 days to get it cleared up. No fault of Camping World but their finance people should have been more understanding. 
Next my delivery date was set for a Saturday. Went to pick it up and was told there were multiple problems. Shower stall leaked the breaker to the fridge did not work and therefore neither did the fridge. The television did not work either. Same Breaker? So I ask if I could leave it and pick it up when the warranty work was done. They told me that was fine it would probably take a couple of weeks to get parts and another week for repairs. I told them that was fine. June rolls around and I needed the trailer because I was going to My Grand daughters wedding and we were going to use the trailer as our place to live for a week. Called Camping world and they said they had the T.V. and fridge working but was still waiting on the shower stall. I told them I need it so they let me take it and to bring it in when I got back.
Went on vacation up north. First night we were there the temperature dropped to about 40 degrees, went to turn the heater on, it didn't work. Thank god my Daughter had a space heater we borrowed. The next morning we tried to use the microwave. You guessed it. It didn't work.
After vacation took it back in. They ordered all parts again. I waited 3 weeks to get it back.
When I picked it up I noticed that the paint on the rear bumper and on the tongue was faded. I ask about it and the guy that was showing me all they had done said that the Arizona sun had that affect on things that it should just wipe off so he took a rag and sprayed something on it and indeed it did wipe off. I took it to my storage facility placed my cover on it and it stayed in storage until late October when we took it on a camping trip. When I removed the cover and rolled it up to hand down to my wife I noticed that the plastic vent covers were cracked I inspected them and they were like paper thin. I fixed them with silicone until we could get new ones. As I was hooking up I noticed the paint was faded again on the rear bumper and the tongue also the battery box strap was rotted and had dropped on the ground. I don't know what they used to clean it but I hope no one else had that happen to them. Never again will I use them and I haven't. Also I will never recommend them to anyone. Also I did not get My $50.00 in store credit that I was promised."
2,1,"Regardless of all the negative reviews I also decided to try it them out. And now I realize the error of my ways. You will literally never get ahold of who you need to get ahold of over the phone. I tried contacting someone for nearly a month, not exaggerating, a month in finance. I had completely lost hope and then finally out of the blue got a call back from them. They said that they finally got things figured out with my contract in the bank and that everything was in my favor to the tune of 2 whole dollars a month. The same day we went in to resign our new contract, we turned in our trailer for service. He said they were 3 weeks out and we said we were fine with that. It is now been a month to the day that we turned in our trailer and I've had no update on the trailer whatsoever. We have called 4 days in a row trying to get a hold of our service writer. They simply tell you we will call once we have an update and they take your phone number. Guess what? Still no call from them. We have finally been told today that our service writer is on vacation and out of town and no one else can help us. This place has the absolute worst communication out of any dealership I have ever dealt with in my entire life. If I wasn't locked into a contract I would tell them just to keep the trailer and I will take my business elsewhere but unfortunately I'm stuck with this terrible terrible dealership and they're completely inept staff!"
2,5,"My first stop there today.  Fantastic inventory, great pricing and unbelievable customer service from every member of the staff.  I did not believe this kind of service still existed."
2,5,"Camping World is a big kid playground. While more expensive than online competitors, it is nice to have some brick and mortar. Employees are helpful, prices are good if you join President's Club."
2,5,We purchased a RV from Desert RV and were so unhappy with the whole experience including the RV.  We thought we would see if Camping World could help us get out from the horrible RV we purchased. The sales rep we spoke with was Dave and he was truly interested in our needs. He was not pushy but actually seemed concerned and wanted to help us.  After giving our info and explaining what we needed Dave went to see what could be done.  Brian came back with Dave and to our surprise we're so honest and didn't try and wrangle us into a RV we could never get out from under if we choose to upgrade with in the future. They explained that the thirty thousand dollar RV was only valued at fifteen. So thanks to Desert Rv we will be stuck with this horrible RV. Lessons learned.  In short we will go to Camping World in the near future because of their honesty and integrity they showed us. Thank you Dave and Brian for showing there is true businesses out there.
2,1,"I am sure this is just old news but man I had to pile on. We went today and was helped by Jason. Now he was nice. Very polite. But man was he CLUELESSSSSSS. He told us they had a RPod. He took us out to see one of the many copycat trailers from other Companies. But he kept calling them RPODS like you would say ""pop up"". Speaking of popups I explained we have one now. He points to a hybrid and says yes we have those. I am like noooooo that isn't a popup. Explained the difference. He knew nothing about length size material options. He didn't even understand that some have aluminum walls and others not. This poor kid needs help. CLEARLY training is terrible. Then he asks if he can get us good terms would we sign today. NOOOOOOOOO. I refuse to buy anywhere that thinks this is a good way to do business!"
2,4,"I brought my trailer here because I tired of failures at other dealers around me. It has now been there twice for various warranty repairs. Each time Erich took it in and from start to end remained a true professional no matter how frustrated I was. With every RV I have bought it always takes forever for parts from the manufacturer and this is not the fault of CW where my frustration is directed. When you spend this much money on something it should be taken care of ASAP. To that end I would give Crossroads an ""F"".

I have also requested various things from them in regards to quotes and explanations on how things work and each time they took the time to help me out. To date, the Mesa location is one of the better experiences I have had!"
2,1,"Stay away! This place is horrible. Some of the worst service I have ever received. Unfortunately, this is the only place for us to get warranty work done. As soon as we can get everthing fixed, we will never be back.


If you still choose to do business with these folks, don't say you weren't warned. You will be sorry."
2,5,"Went by Camping World of Avondale and Service Technician, Steven Valenzuela, was extremely helpful by showing us a Forest River Sierra model that he was prepping for pick up. Steven is also the technician that did all of our warranty work a month ago. Thank you Steven for the great work and customer service."
2,1,"We had made an all cash deal with CW by phone to purchase a used toy hauler - we were told there were no problems and the unit was very clean. The salesman did say there was one minor bubble in the siding. We drove 180 miles to pick up the trailer, when we arrived they had the stereo playing, AC on, canopy out and I thought WOW we got a good deal. WELL... upon inspecting the unit I asked where the bubble was, Ron showed us one and we thought no big deal, went to the other side of the trailer and saw raised siding down the entire thing, we then see the front jack and both front stabilizer jacks were bent (looked like the unit hit the ground at some point) my husband then noticed what appeared to be roof leaks inside the unit. He asked for a ladder to look at the roof - the sales staff would not let my husband on the roof but sent up one of their techs. The tech said the roof looked solid and sealed, my husband then climbed up the ladder anyway and noticed several tears in the roof, the sales staff asked the tech (who previously said it was fine) if the roof had any tears, at this point the tech couldn't lie and said yes, there are a few. 
I read the bad reviews and still chose to ignore them... my bad!! If after reading all the bad reviews you still deal with these people you only have yourself to blame!! They are dishonest and will lie right to your face without hesitation. DO NOT DEAL WITH CAMPING WORLD!!!!"
2,1,"I wish we would have read the reviews on this place! When you buy a new trailer and are promised repairs are to be done you would think that they would be up front with you and tell you approximately how much time this would take. They have had the trailer in their repair facility almost as long as we have had the trailer. Replacing a warped side panel and fixing the scratches on the interior ended up with staples on the walls and screws through to the outside panel. Mind you the sales man we worked with was wonderful but everything since then has been a nightmare. Went in to the store yesterday to check on the status of the repairs as they won't return calls with messages left, to be told by the repair person ""well it's useable "" seriously this is not what we were promised! If they were upfront about how long things would take they would not have so many upset customers. Just be straight with people!"
2,5,"Just wanted to shout out to Darrell Sexton Service department for his help a couple of weeks ago! We were traveling in our Winnebago sightseer and had some problems with our satellite TV.  Even though it was a weekend... These things always happen on weekends...Darryl and his staff took a look at our situation, did some tweaking and we were happily on the road again!  The receptionist we dealt with... I think her name was Kelly... Was so pleasant and welcoming too!
 It is reassuring to know that Camping World is there! It makes traveling less stressful and more fun! Thank you everyone!"
2,1,"You want to buy an RV???
Do your self a favor do not buy it at camping world.  The shadiest place ever !! 
They treat you so well !  Like a long lost friend .  UNTILL   you signed the deal . I wasn't asking for friend I just wanted a sales person Who would be upfront and honest with me. But from sales to the closing in finance watch your back watch your wallet !!! The customer service dropped dramatically after the papers were signed.
 Everything promised was now something they had to charge for !!!  GET everything in writing before you sign the deal don't assume they will honor their word they won't !! Even if you get it in writing they still won't honor it they will claim you misunderstood
They are very vague throughout the whole process .  Heads up the friendlier and more personable they are.. the more you are going to get screwed    Trust  !!  That is a promise don't be fooled they are not your friends they are there to make a sale .   I researched for eight months and visited at least six camping world along with other RV stores.  In California and Arizona .   I can assure you they all operate the same way .  Very unethical practices    low class .  
They promise you service,   And that they are available for you .  They say their service department will take care of you.. NOT  the minute you close the deal you will be lucky to get a phone call back or any kind of help without it costing you Double what it would cost anywhere else.. The only thing Camping World has got is a huge selection of RV's   
CAMPING WORLD... Want to buy an RV
Don't buy it from them."
2,1,"Our experience started out good. The salesman was knowledgable and friendly. Unfortunately, our good experience ended there. We bought our brand new camper in May. We took it out that weekend. The gray water tank leaked and the power converter wasn't working correctly. We understand there were going to be some glitches, so we brought it back to CW for diagnosis. They reported they would need to replace both the tank and the converter. Fine. They put it back together as they said it would take a while for the parts to come in. We were fine with that. We stayed at a site with full hook ups anyway. We went out one more time. We received a call asking to bring it back for the replacement parts to be installed the end of June. My husband brought it back and was told the converter was there, but the tank would be in July 11th and it could be picked up on the 13th. He called July 12th and was told the parts person we had been dealing with no longer worked there, so they had no idea what was going on. We then received a call stating the tank would be in on July 26th!!!! 
We now have been making payments on a unit that we can't even use. My husband finally got someone on the phone July 12th and was told he would look into it and call back today (July 15th). No one called. My husband went down there to see what was going on. He told the service manager this was unacceptable that we have had our camper sitting there waiting on parts for this long. His response was, ""You and 52 other customers."" WTF? Seriously???!!! At this point, I don't even want the stupid thing. Their communication is HORRIBLE. Plus, they are doing NOTHING to make this right. Shame on you, Camping World. For a company that supposedly has their customers' best interests in mind, you are failing miserably. I will be sure to warn others NOT to buy here. I would recommend Little Dealer Little Prices. They might be a bit more expensive, but it's worth avoiding the B.S."
2,1,"What an extraordinarily horrible experience.  The trailer purchased in the spring has been in repairs since BEFORE Labor Day!  They have kept the trailer without ordering the parts. The parts are still not ordered as of today. The GM Tom Alexander states he will resolve this issue. He is unwilling to even look at the account while we are in the room with him. Fishy much? We are supposed to hear from him today. I asked for invoices as well and he tried to ignore my request.  There will be follow up postings. 
And by the way, i had to make a rating of one star in order for this to post....they deserve nothing currently.

12/3/14
Update as promised.  Received call back last night as promised by GM. Also received call this a.m. from Service Advisor, Darrell.  They are still ""looking into"" the issue. Two more weeks for the correct tent fabric, sigh. No up date on side panels, diamond plating and hot water heater issue. Keep in mind people....this trailer only went back to this dealer because of a warped side panel!  Purchased in April 2014,  used ONCE, and it has been back at dealer since. It took a MONTH to get appointment to get it in. And she has been there ever since.  Love paying on something we don't get to use. Love making plans and scheduling time off for hunting when the dealer can't seem to fix one issue and then poor staffing creates many problems. What will the dealer do for us? How will he compensate all the time, money and emotions that have been expended?"
2,5,"Let me just start by saying, A+ rating on all staff members; more importantly, Tommy our salesman. He was honest and sincere from the start and true to his word every step of the way. The minor items we asked to have repaired were completed and he even had other items taken care of that we didn't find during our pre-inspection. We drove out from California just to see the coach and we were sold immediately by not  only the coach, but the amazing customer service we received from Tommy and the rest of the staff. Drove back out a week later to pick it up and it was good to go!! Thank you Camping World for a great buying experience!! We'll be back"
2,5,"This review is based on their service department. They were TERRIFIC

We bought a new Dutchman Infinity 3610RL last fall from another dealer. That was our first mistake but it was a discontinued model and we really liked the floorplan and options. We had a couple of warranty issues right off the bat but that is not uncommon (this is not our first RV).
Dutchman wanted us to use the dealer that we bought the unit from (second mistake for not insisting on Camping World for the warranty issue). After the dealer that we bought it from failed to correct the issues after 4 tries that dealer said they would refuse to do any work on it warranty or otherwise. 
Dutchman was shocked and sent us to Camping World in Avondale. We made an appointment and brought it in and 3 days later everything is corrected! They were GREAT to deal with. We had them install a tow package installed on our Chevy Equinox for towing behind our previous Motorhome several years ago also and that was great also.
Who was that dealer we went through hell with prior to our great experience with Camping World of Avondale you ask?
It was Lifestyle RV in Mesa.

We highly recommend Camping World of Avondale!"
2,1,"Cautionary tale of my recent experience with the service department and extended warranty (not Good Sam). Went in on 4/22 with list of 3 things to fix, two of which involved replacement of Winnebago OEM installed items. As Camping World is a Winnebago dealer I trusted that the would have parts source for their products. I took my rig out of their service department on 5/8 with neither of the OEM parts replaced. Reason? Camping World was sourcing the parts retail and then marking them up 70% and extended warranty company refused to pay. Camping World justified markup and explained that they unfortunately don't have a wholesale source for Winnebago parts and that I'd have to make up the difference out of pocket if I wanted the repairs done. So, if your repair requires parts and you have extended warranty you may be in same situation. BTW, warranty company was willing to pay keystone 40% markup. CW didn't budge. On repair that was done to fix a leak involving the roof mounted A/C the service tech left oily footprints on the carpet and A/C panel fell on floor as I pulled out of their lot. On the repairs that were not done, one involving the OEM Nav system, the dash panel was replaced without reconnecting wiring harness to door locks, emergency flashers and rear defogger which I didn't discover until I tried to unlock my doors. This doesn't begin to express my frustration with the experience of dealing with a company that really doesn't seem to care about customer satisfaction and service. You are forewarned."
2,1,"Wish I didn't have to even give one star! We bought a used RV for over $100K. Three months later, we still can't register the vehicle because:
1. Mileage was wrong. We had to go to the DMV to adjust to actual.
2. found out that they sold this without a smog check. Had to bring it back in, again!

Every time we call service or any one else, we get, It's not my job!  In the meantime, we have  an unregistered vehicle and are making monthly payments of $681 every month for twelve years.

If I had to do it again, I'd never go to this outfit! I'd take my chances and buy direct from the previous owner."
2,1,"Classic bait and switch. Spent an entire afternoon with Debbie the sales lady. Drove all the way to Mesa during rush hour to look at a unit. Was shown the unit and we liked it. Agreed on a purchase price. Signed contract and put up earnest money. Was contacted by Elizabeth the finance lady to set up delivery for Friday and she sent an email which included the final paperwork to sign. I noticed it contained a different vin number than the one I had looked at. Luckily I had taken a picture of the vin while we were at dealership so I could get my insurance started. After bringing up the discrepancy in vin numbers, I was told no less than three times that I had been looking at the wrong number. At this point Jim Johnston became involved. He is the manager. Again, I must be an idiot, because I was told I looked at the wrong number. Turns out I was shown the same unit only four years newer. How was I supposed to know this. I would have looked at the other unit but never heard the magic word. The whole time this was going down it kept somehow being my mistake. The magic word is sorry. This is the straight up definition of bait and switch. Get a person hooked on something then all of a sudden that deal isn't available. Everyone did seem real excited to try and sell me a unit still. Seriously?"

2,1,"Just drove all the way from Southern California to Camping World - Avondale to purchase our 2017 Keystone travel trailer, purchased specifically for a trip the end of June - $18k later we have no hot water heater because they cannot seem to deliver campers with working components.  When you turn on the hot water heater in our 2017 brand new Keystone camper a fire ball explosion occurs but sadly no hot water.  #safety-issue, nonworking critical component.  

They had my husband himself calling around to every RV repair in SoCal looking for someone to repair their poor delivery and inferior work product - no luck.  First available repair August - both the Keystone factory and Camping World dealer have done nothing to resolve...purchase your RV somewhere else, very disappointing customer service!!!"
2,1,I tried the service repair center again. What a joke.  I have called 3 days and no call backs. Like last time.  I finally drive it over to be only told you have to pull out and make an appointment.   Since I complained to this jackhole with the attitude he tells me the next available appointment is 6 weeks out for a generator service. Zero stars and a letter to corporate next.  Every time I try to use this place the same issue with service.
2,4,I want to Thank the sales staff at Camper World. The sale is not about the normal it is about how you solve issues! These folks were first rate thank you to Cory. You made us more than whole. 5 new tires different brand and load rating then what we had. They also fixed all of the damage to include steel plate in the wheel wells. They also completely detailed the camper inside and out. All in less then a week so were able to head to Tombstone today. Outstanding customer service. In need of a camper all I can say.is Camper World!!!
2,5,Go see josie or eric!my family and I broke down and needed to get to our destination asap usually it takes a week with financing and inspection but josie and eric jumped through hoops as well as Liz our finance girl.this was such a wonderful experience I would recommend anyone thinking of buying an rv to go see these guys we really can't thank them enough.they also made the  out of state delivery happen that day and drove 5 hrs after a long day of work instead of the 11/2 hrs they would usually do just so we didn't have to make our trip any longer.we were really treated like family and we were never once talked in to anything we didn't want or need.THANK YOU SO SO MUCH JOSIE ERIC AND LIZ!!
2,1,"Awful. Not friendly. Sold us wrong products. Employees clueless. Not a typical Camping World. If you have the opportunity to visit Mesa or another store, do it and save yourself a lot of headaches and money in returning the wrong merchandise - they recommended. It would be a rating of 0 - but not an option."
2,4,"I'm giving Camping World in Avondale, Az  off of 99 Ave n I-10 heading  to   LA  Debbie n Hal her Husband plus  Liza in Financing were very easy to work with they treated my wife n myself as people not just another sale I had been turned down for the $100,000.00 loan they didn't give up they found bank that works with veterans after 5 denial the USAA BANK said yes we will work with the dealership n the Veteran to get  his RV. Before camping world we had tried 3 other dealerships n got no where Camping World did not give up on us. If u r a US VETERAN n want to get ur RV no matter what size or class give Camping World a chance my wife did the shopping around I had to sign the paperwork which again was mind busting paperwork is a drag Again Camping World is #1 with us so far"
2,1,"Poor customer service over and over again. First I spent a significant amount of money to have my trailer washed and detailed. When I arrived to pick it up, it was filthy. The service manager said ""it rained today and all the employees that detail have left for the day"" Well, when I am told to pick it up, then it should be clean! He had another employee, wipe it with a rag for a few minutes and the manager left for the day. The employee I was left with didn't speak English and nodded then left me with a dirty trailer. When I went back in to complain, the person at front said all service employees were gone for the day.

Fast forward a couple months, I stop by to have tire pressure checked and refill propane. Service representative said no one is here to check tires since they are at lunch. There is NO PROPANE or DUMP StATIOn at this location (ummm, a camping world without basic RV services!) and then I get in my car and there are nails in drive, one of which went through trailer tire. I ask if they can repair a flat, and they don't repair tires either. I drive away, an employee drives up next to me a few miles down the street and says that they do repair tires, I turn around trailer, follow him back on an almost flat tire, then employee says the manager won't let him! Thank goodness for Discount Tire up the street."
2,1,"Terrible service department. I've had my motor home there on and off since September of 2016 and it's still not fixed. In fact, they've managed to break things that worked when I gave it to them. Nobody will call you back. Management is a joke. George the service department manager will never answer his phone or return messages. These people just don't care about their customers. I feel sorry for many of their employees who try and do a good job and get no support. Darrell Sexton in service tries very hard, but the has no support and too many accounts to juggle. I had a sat system installed, it took three months, and they managed to break my power bed and put leaks in the roof. Good luck trying to find anyone to help you."
2,1,"My RV coach batterys were not charging. I called Camping World RV Sales of Avondale, AZ, a Good Sam authorized dealer. They said, ""Bring it in early"". I did that the next morning as advised, arriving at or about 7:30 to 8:00 AM. I paid my bill of $541.62 and checked at 2:42 PM. I waited about 7 hours.
The two coach batterys came to $300.46, labor at $202.50, plus shop supplies and taxes to bring the total cost to $541.62.
I consider the labor exorbitant and the time to replace two batterys and fuse outrageous.
The administration of this Camping World was not existant and the tech testing and replacing the fuse and batterys must have been a novice.
I will nothing more to do with Good Sam Club and Camping World.
Reason of review: Poor customer service.
Monetary Loss: $100.
Preferred solution: Let the company propose a solution."
2,1,They sold us a fifth wheel without a title. Now refuse to do anything about it. The people who made the original sale no longer work there. Now we have an RV that can't be moved or registered. Just great. Worthless management team.
2,5,"purchased a trailer on 2/18/17....Steven Valenzuela was the person that took us on our walk through, he was phenomenal, answered all of our questions and even took the time to help us figure out the towing brake system on our vehicle."
3.5,5,"Great Customer service. Very friendly people. Huge selection..Tom Duluc you are awesome. 
Finally I bought my livinglite 8.4s truck camper and im satisfied with the purchase. 
Smoth transaction.
I had to drive all the way from CA to Ohio to make my dream come true. Now my family and i will enjoy this beautiful camper. 
Thank you Kamper city."
3.5,5,"We have just purchased our third trailer coming from Kamper City.  Jason was our salesperson and he did a great job.  Showed us just what we wanted in 3 trailers they had.  The owner helped us make a deal that was good for both of us.  We did our walk through today, added a few extras we wanted and left with our new (2012) trailer.  The guys helping install the extras worked hard and fast.  Great place to but, check them out if looking for an RV."
3.5,5,"Recently (October 26, 2017) I had my RV winterized and the entry steps lubricated and adjusted. The service was performed promptly and professionally.  The service tech took the time to explain what he did and I felt assured the work was complete and done correctly.  While waiting in the customer service room, I had the opportunity to speak with both the owner and the sales manager, who were welcoming and very knowledgeable about the business.  These guys know RV's! I would definitely recommend Kamper City if you are looking to buy an RV or have it serviced."
3.5,1,"We called Kamper City on May 12th to make appointment to take our 2016 Flagstaff MicroLite in to have slideout looked at.  My husband spoke to Matt in the service department and he said to bring it in on Tuesday the 17th and he would take a look at it so he took off work to keep the appointment.  As soon as he got there, Michael the owner came out and said there's no way that it was going to happen (take a look at it). So we were told to leave it there and they would get to it when they had time. We were told pictures had to be taken, the repair had to be approved then the part would be ordered and it would take awhile to get it in. Michael was very nasty from the first day until the day we picked it up. 

So on May 17th I got on Forest Rivers customer service website to see if they would be able to help in getting the process moved along more quickly. On June 2nd I called Jake to let him know there was still no time frame or date for when we could get this fixed.  Jake said the ram motor is a common part, the repair takes an hour and the part if ordered on a Monday would be shipped on that Thursday and the dealer would received it by the next Monday. He said the motor should have been ordered through Forest River not Lippert since the camper is so new.

So knowing this I called Lisa the ""warranty department manager"" on Saturday June 4th to see if I could get answers on when we may be able to get the slideout fixed. She said they got ""pre-approval"" for the repair and was waiting for the final approval I guess. Michael called me and said they would for sure call me the next week to let me know what they found out. I never received a call. My husband contacted Lippert who would supply the ram motor and was told  it had been ordered June 6th, the Monday after I had spoke to both Lisa and MIchael. So knowing this I called Lisa again on the 16th and she said they were waiting, everything had been approved and expected it to come in the beginning of the next week. She'd call me when it arrived, never received a call. On June 22nd my husband called and Lisa was out so he got to talk to Christine who said the part had been there awhile, didn't he get a call or a postcard saying it had come in. Seriously??  She said to bring it in the next morning, but we do have to work so asked if we could drop it off Saturday and they would fix it Monday. They called Monday morning and said they had it fixed Saturday, we drive an hour each way to get there, you think they could have said why don't you get some lunch and we'll replace the motor today. No...

On June 27th when he was finally able to pick it up he got there and Michael yelled to Lisa that ""the pain in the ass who keeps calling is here and wants to talk to you"". She couldn't be bothered I guess, she never came out.

We had bought it the middle of August last year and used it a few times, kept in an enclosed building for the winter and was anxious to use it for Memorial Day weekend. I would never have thought it would take 2 months to get it repaired and on top of that be treated so horribly by the owner.  I have a list of items I want to purchase and I would have liked to shopped in their store. Not after the way this whole experience went, I will never step foot on the property or recommend Kamper City to anyone. I will let Jake at Forest River know how Michael treats his customers.  Matt, the service manager was kind through this whole experience.

To Stephanie Brewer who traveled 650 miles to save $11,000 dollars, I hope when the time comes and you need help getting something repaired your local dealer will treat you like a customer and not ""a pain in the ass"""
3.5,1,"Wow.  And I thought I was the only one who had problems with Kamper City.   As another customer wrote here, this is a family business ruined by the family members.  Such rudeness.  Such arrogance.  You'd think it was an upscale boutique by the way they treat people.  Maybe no one told the owners that they own a camper lot spelled with a ""k""?  

I suggested to my friend that he go elsewhere for his purchase.  He did and he was very pleased with both the service and the product.   Some businesses care about their customers and their image; unfortunate Kamper City (with a ""K"") is not one of them.  Avoid."
4.5,5,"My 2013 Forest River XLR Toyhauler was built very poorly as usual from the factory, RVMT (Jason) has been the best in explaining, showing, and getting all the imperfections corrected.  I am very happy to have found RVMT and Jason, thank you again for your expert customer service and work.

4.5,5,"rvmaster techs handled the sale of my motorhome, excelent follow through and completion of sale. I couldn't be more satisfied"
4.5,5,"I have been looking for a used RV in the $20-30k, as a wedding present for my soon-to-be bride. Many of the dealerships pretty much dismissed me as a customer, cause I wasn't gonna spend big bucks for something huge. I talked to Mike at RV-MT, and he had a nice used coach, a Born Free. Even though it had higher miles, he assured me it had been well maintained. 

Upon arriving, Mike took lots of time with me, as I am a first time RV'er, and he told me that every employee at RV-MT were RV owners. Everyone there was very nice, and considerate, which is something I did not get from other dealerships. Mike was interested in how we would use the RV, and walked me through all of the questions a first-timer may not even have known to ask. 

He built the value of the coach, and pointed out why it was worth the money, more than others that I had looked at. We made a deal, and they will walk us through all of the features and sub-systems that it has. 

RV-MT was, by far, the most honest and straight-forward dealership to which I spoke. I am pleased to have purchased here, and although it is a bit out of my way, I will also come here for service. I heartily recommend doing business here. Its worth the drive and time to work with such wonderful people. ... OH YES, you might ask, what did my fiancée think?, She was both surprised and delighted... she is already planning trips to San Diego, and that's the rest of the story."
4.5,5,"I have been using RV Master Techs for over 5 years. I will only have  then work on my Fifthwheels and nobody else! I actually could not wait for my Factory warranty to expire on my latest unit as Jason and the guys really care for and know how to fix things right.  I know they are usally pretty busy but they work as hard as they can to get your unit back to you as soon as possible. I reccommend that you give them a shot as you wont be disappointed, and if by chance you are they will make things right."
4.5,5,"I am happy I found an RV shop with employees who seem to care about customer service and satisfaction, more than the OTHER shop I've been dealing with. Jason, the service manager, was so good to me yesterday and got the job done quickly and effectively. Casper, the tech, had good customer service skills as well as knowledge of the repair job. And Leese who did the detailing also. I feel confident this shop knows what they're doing and I will return!"
4.5,5,"As FULL Time RV'ers for the past 9 years we work throughout the western states traveling 10 months out of the year. We spend November and December in Phoenix each year, which are the only months our 2000 Winnebago diesel pusher is not rolling.
We discovered RV Master Techs in 2009 they were able to fix several chronic problems on our coach that previous service centers and dealers didn't fix but did charge for. Master Techs fixed these problems RIGHT the FIRST time and they stayed fixed!
We have come to depend on their expertise for everything related to our coach. 
Our ONLY complaint is that we can't take them with us when we leave Phoenix.
With 173,000 miles on our motorhome if a repair can wait until November we wait until we can make it back to RV Master Techs or we call for advise and direction. 
Thank you Master Techs!"
4.5,5,"Great Small Business
We have been working with RVMT since we bought our 2006 Winnebago 38T in 2008. It was plagued with issues for a long time. Jason was always very friendly and attentive to the issue and it was always fixed correctly and on time. Winnebago had design issues with this model that resulted in continued service and we ran our extended warranty company ragged as a result but without RVMT we would have been lost.
One time on an extended trip we broke down 300 miles from home, we called Jason and he found a mobile repair person, verified he was authorized to perform work for our warranty company, sent him to us and we back on the road within an hour. THAT FOLKS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE!
We sold our MH last fall and the new parents could not be happier (we keep in contact).
When our new RV runs out of warranty in October we will be right back at RVMT."
4.5,1,"Wow! Just wow!  Having some work done today on my RV on things that RVMT had ""repaired"" previously.  These guys ""fixed"" my tank valves and less than a year later, we were having problems again.  My mobile tech had to replace today and was surprised to find that the wrong parts had been used.  This has proven to be also true of the broken drain pipe in the shower. I guess they never truly fixed it and we had a hidden slow leak.  They had also done warranty work on our fridge....twice.  Guess what!?  Never fixed it and found out that it was a faulty fan the whole time.  RVMT cleaned up on the warranty money and now I am having to pay out of pocket to redo all the things they supposedly fixed.  Thanks guys :("
4.5,5,"I was referred to RV Master Techs by the owner of an RV Park in Gila Bend, AZ.  He said they were fair and did good work.  We had had problems with our awning collapsing.  We drove our Motorhome up and they worked us into their schedule with ease.  The repair completed, we went on our way south.  Unfortunately the repair left something to be desired.  I called Jason, the Service Manager and told him of the problem.  He asked that when we returned to the area that I bring the rig in.  I was two months or so later that I finally got back.  Jason set me up to come in and get the problem rectified.  The fixed the problem and also did a lube and oil change.   As a bonus, they did other service for me gratis.  I couldn't have asked for better, nor more efficient service.  They are competent and trustworthy.  I'd go back any day."
4.5,5,"It took a few attempts to get things accomplished with our 5th wheel, but ultimately it can be said that the customer service and workmanship we received was wonderful.  Thank you Eric, Jason and crew.  Although you'll be our ""go to"" for future work on our rig, we're hoping it will be sometime in the distant future!"
4.5,5,"One word for this place, OUTSTANDING! I had a Blue Ox tow system installed on my 2017 Jeep yesterday. Chris did such a good job you can't even tell the system was installed. His attention to detail was amazing and it's clear this place is proud of the the work they do. If you want a cheap job go to Camping World, if you want it done right, see RV Master Techs. 
They've earned my business from this day on."
4.5,5,"Tried of hearing excuses from Camping World, I was too... so let me tell you this, the service department at RV Master Techs provides outstanding professional service! I could not be happier. No need to battle, they have excellent customer service and you're not waiting WEEKS for your work to be completed. They recently offered a free seminar for Solar, the service guy did an outstanding job!! We walked away knowing how Solar actually works. Questions were asked, and he nailed the answers! Don't let Camping World cause you unnecessary stress CALL RV Master Techs!! You won't be sorry. They did repair work on our Cedar Creek, Silverback."
5,5,Corey and the crew are spot on. They do great work at a fair price and deliver as promised. On time for me and my business is critical.  They have handled several projects and repairs. I have never been disappointed. Highly recommended.
5,5,"I've been here multiple times now for different reasons.   They have a great shop and a ton of heavy duty stuff for trailers and towing.   They also service big trucks suspensions.
Customer service has always been good for me and they were able to answer my countless questions without seeming annoyed.  They are very knowledgeable at what they do and their prices are tough to beat.   Stop in and check this place out!"
5,5,I had some issues with the initial customer service but once I brought up my concerns they were promptly taken care of and I was back on the road overall wish it I didn't have any issues but overall my issues was taken care of and I was back to work
5,5,Thank you Spectrac! I went in looking for some parts for a project I was working on. Not only did they have a great selection but the customer service was great. Thanks for helping me out!
5,5,Best customer service ive had In like forever. Brian Gaustad has gone above and beyond on several occasions. He guided me thru a camping trailer build. Several times when i bought the wrong product he returned it no problem and got me the right stuff. He hooked me up with bearing caps when i kept destroying the ones I purchased. Always answered every dumb question i had. I had a lot. I highly recommend them.
5,5,"Immensely impressed with Spectrac.  Service Rep, Corey, extremely informative and helpful - drove me to a nearby cafe while they worked on my rig.  They estimated $700 to fix my chassis and I definitely expected to pay.  After reviewing my rig,  the mechanic (Matt) and Corey recommended it wasn't imperative that I fix it and CHARGED ME NOTHING for their time.  Whole staff helpful, friendly, and honest!  Thank you!"
5,5,"I run a company that has about 10 trailers and often need work done to them, as they have high mileage.  I found Chandler after having problems with a prior mobile trailer mechanic.  Chandler came out and diagnosed the problem immediately and fixed it on the spot.  He was professional and courteous and helps to explain exactly what the problem is and how he is fixing it, without talking down to you.  I HIGHLY recommend him."
5,5,"Chandler is out standing individual, it's so rewarding to have a person come to your home and be able to install a hitch. He is professional all the way. Had all the tools to complete the job. I highly recommend him."
5,5,"I can't say enough good things about Chandler. I had a trailer that I was trying to take on a long road trip and my lights weren't working. I called Chandler and he fit me in last minute.  He's a mobile service which is amazing as I didn't have to take my trailer anywhere.  He came to my house at the time promised and worked hard in the hot sun to get the job done in time for my trip.  

He had all the parts necessary to fix our trailer and even checked the trailer over to see if anything additional needed to be done. Our wheel bearings had never been done, and he did that also.  He was professional, knowledgeable and did a great job. I cannot recommend him enough."
5,5,"Chandler diagnosed our tricky propane leak in under two hours--we found him after dealing with another mobile RV tech that wasn't able to find it after almost a month and then denied that we had one! We found out that Chandler is certified in LP and he did a combination of a soap/water check and manometer testing as opposed to just an LP sniffer like some mobile RV techs seem to do. He was friendly, timely, and extremely professional. We'll definitely call him again if we have any other problems with our camper van."
5,5,Zia did a great job.  Was one time and told me exactly what I needed to install the fifth wheel hitch on my new truck.  He did a very professional job  I would highly recommend him to others
5,5,"Our trailer's turning lights were not working and we had a neighbor try to rewire everything. Unfortunately, that had made things worse. Needing to be fixed immediately, I called several businesses on a Sunday and every one was closed or told me they would not be able to rewire trailer lights. Finally called Zia, Chandler answered right away and we were abe to schedule for the next morning. Chandler came to our business and did an amazing and very professional job. Previously, the wires were zip-tied on the outside and had wires hanging out. Chandler was able to rewire the entire trailer and have the wires go through the tongue of the trailer so nothing was exposed! Everything works properly again! We also had him come back and rewire our second trailer. Having issues with our trailers before, it was very difficult to find an honest and friendly mechanic. We will definitely be keeping Zia Hitch and Trailer Repair's number for the future. Thanks Chandler!"

Have a Blessed day"
4,3,"Update: I originally had this rated as 1 star, but I decided that it was unfair to rate this business based on one interaction with one person. 

My wife, my son (older teen with a disability) and I wanted to get out of the house yesterday, so we decided to go look at some fifth wheel trailers. We had never been to this location prior to this visit. Our son had to use the restroom, so we walked into the office and asked where the restrooms were. A lady told us and we walked down the hall with our son. 

While he was in the bathroom, she approached my wife and I and asked if their was anything in particular we wanted to look at. My wife said something to the effect of we are just getting out of the house today. Is it ok if we just look. The lady said, ""So, you're not interested in buying"". My wife said no, is that ok? Their was an obvious hesitation followed by a tentative, ""Yes, but we'll be closing soon."" My wife and I looked at each other, then I said, ""It's just after 2:30 and you close at 5:00. 

It was obvious that she was trying to discourage us, but we went and looked through some units by ourselves. Truth be told, we have owned a few different trailers / fifth wheels, and are looking to get back into one in a year or so. Our last fifth wheel was a 38' Heartland Bighorn. 
We did see a nice Heartland Elkridge that fits what we may be looking for down the line. It's a shame that Johnny Walker RV doesn't seem to want to work with us in the future."
4,5,We had an amazing experience at Johnnie Walkers! They treat you like family and go above and beyond to make sure you are happy! We were extremely picky and took a long time to find what we were looking for but Angela was so patient with us and really went the extra mile to make sure we were getting what we want! Even after our purchase she is still just a phone call away and happy to help us or answer questions! We are customers for life!
4,4,I have a love hate love hate love relationship with Johnny Walker of course mark the salesman is a fabulous human being the service staff with David and Alan are outstanding not so happy with everyone else just the fact is is that be home away from home we bought has just been a chaos of constant fixing it fixing it fixing it it's like a money pit for a house just would like to have them sell better quality.
4,5,"Johnnie Walker RV's is a great company made up of good people and more than half a century's worth of experience.   No tricks to their trade, just good honest work."
4,1,"The service is enept. On a 1 to 10 I rate they are 2. I was sold a 28 ft travel trailer. But it was 31 ft. I sure I payed twice. I saw one advertise , at 6800$.  I payed 17000. Retired and sick."
4,5,Great experience just bought our 2nd trailer here everyone very helpful from our salesmen to the mechanic that showed us how to work it.  everyone very friendly would reccomend this place
4,5,This is for those at Johhny Walker who have helped us over the last couple years.We were not sure what we wanted a motorhome or fifth wheel.Finally we have gotten an answer i called about a fifth wheel that just came in.It was still in the cleaning bay spoke to Robo and went to see Steve took us to see it.Was everthing we wanted and more.A special thanks to Steve and Robo they went above and beyond for us feelin very grateful Joe & Shirley Casimates
4,5,"Came in here the other week to look around and check out the service department. Like what I saw and people I talked to. Brought my trailer in to have service. After dropping off my trailer and looking at some of the new trailers, we stopped by the other Johnnie Walker  down the way and looked at new trailers out of curiosity. Felt like the salesperson listen to what I was saying and was interested in knowing what i was looking for and also asking questions to understand what would fit my family well. Wasn't ready to buy but with the information and help of the sales staff I feel very comfortable and will be back to either check out new inventory and / or ready to buy. 
   My trailer was serviced in a timely matter and happy with the service department."
4,1,"I purchased an RV from them several years ago and have had zero issues until now. I buy all my supplies from them I like to think I'm a loyal customer. Last year I tried to purchase a new rv and ended up purchasing one in Arizona because they beat there price by almost $10,000. I still continued to buy the rest of my stuff from Jonnie Walker. Knowing that they sale the same brand rv that I purchased I thought I would go to them for service seeing how I've used them several times in the past. I have tried two time to have warranty work done there and both times I have been told no. Very disappointing. They tell me they are backed up by a month, so I ask to schedule an appointment a month or so out there immediate response in no. I certainly will stop using Jonnie Walker for any supplies or future purchases. This is horrible customer service from a company that claims to be family owned."
4,1,"Way over paid for a camper that had so many issues. Great sales lady and I don't blame her as she may have not known service sent it out this way. All flaws were covered up by plugging it in so she may not have known either. Partly my fault for believing them that things worked and that they would not lie or cover up issues. Started off bad when they didn't get there end of the deal done on time and we were forced to take a unit that wasn't as agreed on but I was bound by my 1659 deposit. Hind site being 20/20......would have been a well spent 1650! Got to our destination and the generator was non functional and the batteries that power the unit were bad. Cost me 200 dollars to replace due to the fact I had to drive 42 miles to a hole in the wall town with only one parts store! SUPPLY and DEMAND at its finest. This was all covered up by them being able to plug it in. First night we were camping we spent with a beeping noise that we had no power. Spent our whole vacation fixing issue after issue. Honestly the worst camping experience of my life. Didn't have any time to spend with my family. Go anywhere else for an RV.

Upon leaving we bought a water hose to fill our RV. This was priced at 29 dollars....we got to pay 929 dollars and could get it reversed for a week. 

I will NEVER be back. Not even to get the item they still owe us when they didn't have our unit ready as promised even with two weeks notice! 

Just a horrible experience! #justoverit"
4,5,"We recently purchased our travel trailer from Johnnie Walker RV.  We were supposed to spend the night in our RV on Thursday evening, but when we returned home to pick up our dogs, we found that our tree was uprooting due to the severe windstorm that was sweeping through Las Vegas.  We had to cancel our stay, but when I called and asked if we could stay Friday night, no problem.  There were so many taking their RV's home on Saturday that they called in extra help to assist everyone.  We couldn't have picked a better dealership - Johnnie Walker is top notch!  We purchased an amazing travel trailer at an awesome price!!!"
4,5,"Absolutely the best! After looking all over Las Vegas and SoCal, we chose our model of trailer so we could buy through Johnny Walker. Every single person we dealt with was amazing from parts/service to finance and even the Lot Manager. A special shout out and thank you to our Sales Person, Angela. She was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, accommodating and most importantly, genuine. If you're going to buy, support our community and small businesses and go through Johnny Walker and Angela. I highly recommend them and will be a customer for life!"
4,5,"Picked up our new MH yesterday and was extended a two night stay on JWRV property to assure all working well. Many thanks to our fantastic sales person Angela Beal, our walk thru host Jose, and all the staff at Johnny Walker for your hospitality, friendliness, warmth and commitment to excellence in service....you did it!!"
4,5,"My sales man Troy went out of his way to find me help what I wanted. If you decide to buy an RV from Johnnie Walker my honest opinion is you could not go wrong by specifically asking for Troy.
Everybody went out of there way to make sure I was served well. Go see the guys at Johnnie Walker RV to buy your next RV"
4,5,"We have been in the market for a motorhome for the past few years.  There are plenty of RV dealers in the Las Vegas area and we explored most of them.  I've always heard really great things about Johnnie Walker RV from friends who have purchased, but did realize just how good they are.  Most of the buying experience was with our sales man Mark and he was very patient and quite knowledgeable. Mark went out of his way to answer our countless questions without making us fill silly. I'm pretty sure we asked some silly questions, but this is our first RV.  Mark was also very honest and straightforward.  He did not rush us or throw gimmicks our way.  I asked about additional fees and was surprised there was only one $99 document fee when some of the other places had several fees that here several hundred dollars each.

We mostly worked with Mark, but the entire Johnnie Walker team is fantastic.  Buying a motorhome and figuring out how to use it is very daunting.  Everyone we encountered was top-notch and very friendly.  Johnnie Walker RV focuses on the customer experience and it shows.  The amenity kit they give you provides everything required to hookup to water and electricity.  There are some other useful things in it such as a camping toilet paper and chemical for black water tank.

Johnnie Walker RV provided a pretty good walkthrough of the RV to explain how everything works.  They actually have a mechanic go over all the systems with you which is really neat. Matt took us around and was pretty fast and efficient. We had to slow him down at times and he was open to that and answered our questions.  Luckily we had some questions written down in advance and weren't afraid to ask others that came up.

One of the best things for first time RVers is the little camping area park they have on the lot.  They had the motorhome all hooked up and let us spend the night.  Mark came by a few times to check on us and sent someone over to answer our questions.  The Johnnie Walker team goes out of their way to make sure you are comfortable to with the unit.  We had a few glitches and it would not be very good trying to figure them out in the middle of nowhere.  

The RV is great for the most part.  The only bad thing with our Thor Chateau and this isn't Johnnie Walker's RV fault, is the radio is beyond horrible. The blue tooth features are primitive at best, the backup camera can barely be seen, and it is not ready for XM Radio.  Every car I've purchased in the past 10 years comes with XM or Sirus yet a RV designed to travel the country doesn't.  What is worse the is the owner's manual reflects it has XM but Thor took out that radio.

The bottom line is I highly recommend giving Johnnie Walker RV a shot if in the market for a RV.  They are a fantastic bunch of professionals."
4,1,"STOP! Before you purchase an RV you need to read this review. I purchased a BRAND NEW 2018 TT from JWRV and had nothing but problems since they took my cash, in full payment. For example, when we went to acquire the trailer and do our campout schooling and walk through they preach about, we found little repairs and things, mostly cosmetic that needed attention. We were assured our Technician would be right back. This was a Friday afternoon. We didn't see him again until Tuesday afternoon. We were now over a day late to our delivery destination, and we were now having other issues with the water heater and gas system. Late Tuesday afternoon a technician came over and quickly fixed, repaired and cleaned paint on the TT. Still having issues with the heater / gas systems the Manager begrudgingly came over to have a look. He was extremely rude, condescending, and acted so put out at the fact that he had to concern himself with our brand new trailers' issues. After an extreme amount of hostility and disrespect from the service manager, I called our sales lady and expressed to her that we needed off this lot ASAP. She was able to have their driver remove us from there and drop us at their other location down the road. From there, that team jiggled the handle so to speak on the water heater and called it good. After a few other minor things we were finally able to have the TT delivered to our destination.  Once the TT was delivered, the truck driver tried to level it and get it set. He did NOT now how to set it on the blocks and without proper communication, dropped the trailer and rolled the trailer hitch end driver side jack. Aside from that damage on delivery... the water heater and gas issues continued. After calling into service about the issues we were informed that the circuit board that controls those systems was bad and or recalled. I won't go into the avalanche of problems that ensue for several months with JWRV and the Manufacturer of the RV. But in summation, every major component and system was ripped out of our brand new 2018 TT IN LESS THAN 2 MONTHS of owning it. After a wasted two months of what should have been cross country travel time, we had to get back to work. A few months go by and a shop guy from the manufacturer calls out of no where and get this, offers to pick up my trailer, take it to another city and state to work on it. Really!?!? Ok. So I can never see it again? Ridiculous. On top of having no idea about the problems we have had, just wants to run off with it. The stack of work orders piled up like you wouldn't believe. But that's ok, because it's under warranty, and like Darcy Walker says, this is what you should expect. When you buy a trailer (even a brand new, fresh off the truck) you should expect to do repairs. I think that's completely fair don't you? To put down 27k and then dedicate the next year of your lives hoping that the un burned propane leaking into you coach doesn't kill you in your sleep. Or that the T&P valve doesn't fail and give you 1st degree burns all over. Or.....  I think as consumers we can all expect to do general up keep and maintenance right? Sure! Or course! But I do find it ABSURD to suggest that your customers except the LEMONS you're selling and to make those excuses. The management and employees know that people will not want to fight them and trust me, they bank on it! Throughout this horrible experience they have repeatedly, told us to go somewhere else, have someone else look at it, pass the buck, except it, we'll never buy it back! ... the excuses and reasoning behind these many statements became very transparent, very quickly. If you buy a rec vehicle, buy used!!! The depreciation of RV's before you even drive off the lot is in itself a huge loss. Buy used. And just know that if you have issue (and based on Darcy Walkers own statements) you will be put in a very long line of other people's needed repairs and the finger pointing and run around will begin. Good luck with that! Know your legal rights and what you're willing to deal with before shopping with JWrv. You don't want to get stuck with a lemon! I would not recommend any of their locations for sales or service. This company did not provide any useful industry knowledge, nor did they provide a satisfactory resolution to our unresolved issues.  Buyers beware. Hope this experience helps others!"
4,5,"I would highly recommend Johnnie Walker RV to anyone who owns or is interested in owning an RV.  They a great organization, always willing to help whenever I need them.  Thanks again."
4,5,Very professional and fast transaction when buying my new trailer at Johnnie walker thank to our salesman Jared Munk and the rest of the team.
4,5,"We have owned our Thor Chateau 22B motorhome for 13 months and have taken it on several trips.  We just returned from a 10-day trip to Idaho Falls, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, and Zion.  The motorhome performed flawlessly the entire 1,650 miles while towing our Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk with ease.

The Johnnie Walker team has been there for us after the sale on several occasions.  They have gone out of their way to assist us since the purchase to include answering many questions and handling warranty repairs.  The motorhome is great but has needed some minor repairs and adjustments.  Luckily, we have many friends with motorhomes and were prepared to deal with this common issue.  The service department headed my Ken Allen has been top-notch.  They have even solved many problems over the phone or by email saving me a trip in and keeping dollars in my pockets.

I can not say enough good things about our sales agent Mark. He has been so helpful and always answers questions when contacted.  He also recently sold a trailer to our friends and they are very happy with the service he provided.  

We continue to enjoy our motorhome and to be impressed my the Johnnie Walker Team!"
4,5,"I highly recommend Johnnie Walker for all of your RV needs. Not only did we love our experience buying our RV from Johnnie Walker but Kirk, Joe and the rest of the parts and service have consistently gone above and beyond our expectations for everything we have needed since our purchase. Our entire experience with Johnnie Walker has been 5-Star! We are new to RV'ing and had 100 questions! The staff was so helpful and understanding. They made us feel comfortable asking questions and offered valuable information to get us started. Recently our RV was broken into at a storage facility (not Johnnie Walker's) and we lost of lot of parts and supplies. Kirk and Joe took great care of us in our time of need and helped us get our RV back on the road. They even offered us additional discounts to replace our stolen parts. We are now storing our RV at Johnnie Walker and we feel so much safer. Do yourself a favor. Skip the others and just go to Johnnie Walker. They are the best in Vegas."
4,5,"Todd Stancliff was very helpful in helping us select a newer 5th wheel to replace our older one. He let us take our time in checking out the 2004  Montana. He answered all our questions and showed all the units available. We purchased the coach without any hassle. They offered their north lot to transfer our ""stuff"" to the new unit. The next day both my wife and I got sick with the flu. It took us almost two weeks to transfer but    Everyone there was so helpful. The day before we left I fell out of the new coach, fracturing 2 ribs and chipping my elbow. Everyone helped me hook up to move back to our campground. The service manager, Danny, service techs Tom  & Mike were great. We are sending people here to check them out!"
4,5,"More than a year later, they are STILL answering my stupid questions. More than a year later, I STILL feel the same about them. But now I need to add Ed (in service) to my list of... (LOVE THIS GUY).

In about 8 more months, I am getting a 5th wheel."
4,4,"The hubby and I decided on JW when it came time to buy an RV because he had purchased from them before so he felt they would give us the best treatment being a repeat customer. We did shop around at other RV dealers in town, but it came down to models available and pricing for us and that is where JW hit the nail on the head. We are not new to the RV world and had done a lot of research prior to going in. The entire process took 24 hours( we went home and slept on pros and cons of making such a big purchase.) We were pleased when we picked up the RV a week later. We were given a very thorough walk through which was helpful. The sales, service, and financing departments were friendly. We know they are trying to make a buck off of sales and we are trying to save some bucks, but we didn't feel any kind of pressure or rush to close the deal."
4,1,Every time I call for service they tell me it's a rush?!? Winter time you said call back spring call back?!?  WTF. I will find another place to spend my hard earned money.
4,5,This place rocks! I have several friends who bought from other places and none of them are happy. I meet people who bought from jw and they are always happy. Do not go anywhere else.
4,1,No stars. This place just ruined our lives. They sold us an RV with a bad motor and said theirs nothing they can do for us. This was supposed to be our home. I dont know what to do. We have 9 days and it took everything we had to get. If i were you STAY AWAY FROM JOHNNY WALKER RV. Just disgusting.
4,5,"We are in the market for a travel trailer. We walked into Johnnie Walker not knowing what to expect. My husband and I had our 4 kiddos with us and were  ready to shop. Mark walked us around the lot, listened to what was important to us and gave us some great options. Mark was so knowledgeable and helpful. He included the children in the experience as well. He never showed us anything that didn't fit our needs and never pressured us. Great experience!"
4,5,"I walked in to Johnnie Walker RV and was greeted by Denny. I told him I was shopping for an RV and when I found one I wanted I would bring my husband Ray to come and look. Since this was going to be our first RV there were a lot of questions and Denny answered every one of them and not only that showed me what he was talking about. He asked me lots of questions as to what we would like in an RV and led me to a 2011 Fleetwood Terra. This beautiful coach looked brand new and when I saw there was only 7000 miles, I was even more interested. I envisioned my husband and I in this motor home looking at everything including the outside. It was well taken care of by the original owner. I told Denny I would be back. 
I went to a few other dealers, but they were more like car sales men and lady. Giving me the sales pitch and stories I did not want to hear. I kept thinking of the RV at Johnnie Walkers and asked my husband to come see it. So the next day my husband and I went back and decided to see if we could afford to finance this RV to meet our budget. Denny worked hard to make it happen. It took a few time back to the drawing board with finance, but we finally got to a price we could afford. The next day Denny called me and let me know the financing had went through. I was so happy, he then told me but the payment is not going to be what we told you. My heart fell like t ton of bricks. He went on to saying the payment is less than what we quoted, almost $100.00 less a month. This was such great news we rushed over and signed those docs before they changed their minds. 
Since this was our first RV we were invited to spend the night to get acquainted with our purchase and get some free schooling on the use of the RV. This took a couple of hours since we had lots of questions. Then we spent the night.... We love this RV and the wonderful service Denny gave us was awesome! 
We used the service department also to fix a couple of minor flaws we found. They gave me a date and 2 days later we had our beautiful RV back on the road.
Since 11/21/14 we have been out on short trips 3 times and now we feel we are ready to head up to Colorado Springs for Xmas. 
THANK YOU DENNY you made our experience buying our RV enjoyable and we hope you will be there IF we should decide to upgrade... 
EVERYONE TREATS YOU LIKE FAMILY AT JOHNNIE WALKER RV!"
3.5,5,Amazing Owners/Staff. They are a no non-sense group of people that want their guests/residents to have a good time and a safe place to be. The park is clean and quiet. I stayed there a couple of months while working in Charlotte and never had an issue with noise or people. I highly recommend this RV park. It is literally across the street from the speedway which is super convenient for a spectator too!
3.5,5,"We stayed here for a week while evacuating hurricane Irma. The campground is well maintained and right across from the Speedway, so it would be perfect for race fans.   This is family run and they were nothing but gracious.  They stayed up late to make sure we were able to get in and helped us hook up and get settle.  The park is very easy to maneuver.. We have a 40' class A and had no problem parking.   There is no cable or wifi, but we were able to get a lot of channels, including all the major networks, just using our antenna.  We had no problem using our phone to search the Internet and set up a hot spot when needed to work from the RV.   We are very thankful for all their hospitality and would definitely recommend and return."
3.5,4,"We have stayed here many times and are very happy and the quality of the RV campground is fantastic. They are very friendly and help whenever we need them!  We will continue to stay here for a long time! We come here during the NASCAR race and it is great! We are very close to the race! 

When I first reviewed this place I was very happy they treated us great!"

3.5,1,"Out of all our years camping, this is 100% the worst place we have stayed. I was looking for a quiet place to stay while going to the rennisance festival so I chose a weekend without a race going on. Unfortunately there was a whole carnival happening in their lot which of course they never told us about in advance, we thought we did enough research to know nothing was going on that weekened. But we figured it wouldn't be too bad since it ended at 11pm. We went out for dinner and when we came back the whole area was a parking lot, including any access ways to get to our rv. We had to walk with our 3 young children. We could barely walk our dogs because of course any possible spot was used as parking. The next morning, even though we didn't have to dodge cars, we had to dodge piles of vomit and chicken legs so our dogs weren't eating them. Then to make a bad weekend even worse, I wrote about my weekend on their fb page. The employees made a fake fb page just to come and attack me personally on it, saying people should ignore my review because I have low self esteem which I talk about on my personal page. All of this was rediculous, the place was gross. I'm glad it left such an impression on me so I definitely remember not to stay there next time we are in town"
3.5,5,We have stayed here many times and are very happy and the quality of the RV campground is fantastic. They are very friendly and help whenever we need them!  We will continue to stay here for a long time! We come here during the NASCAR race and it is great! We are very close to the race and can hear it from our motor home. They have full hookups! And with an antenna you can get lots of channel! The only thing they need is WIFI. But our grandchildren love this place!!
3.5,1,"Terrible ! The manager is very rude,lots of rules and selective to whom they are applied.They are NOT pet friendly ,the manager took my lab puppy,9 months old ,tied him to a tree way up the hill from my camper and threatened to evict me because he was barking ,give me a break!! Then picked on me the whole time we were there,I didn't say a negative thing to him.I highly suggest staying on the speedway property ,I have before,no issues ,I thought we would give this place a try ,BIG MISTAKE!!"
3.5,5,Great campground that is directly across from NASCAR track. Full hookups. Great fun during race time. I have used this campground for 3 years and it is great.
3.5,1,"The owner of this place is an angry, bad, and destructive man.  We accidentally parked on a totally empty field he runs and he stole our tags, kicked in the doors of our truck and stole items from our bed.  These are very bad people and we ask you don't do business with them to show that abusive, negative behavior is not acceptable to the people that are here to respect each other and have a good time me.  The proprietor here is a very bad person.  Do not pay him."
3.5,5,Great campground that is directly across from NASCAR track. Full hookups. Great fun during race time. I have used this campground for 4 years and it is great. The staff is super and very helpful. They keep it very clean even during race time with huge crowds. Site are well groomed.
3,1,"I moved into 9920 Apartments in 2013 and I loved it. The staff was friendly and each maintenance request I submitted was processed and completed in a timely manner. I felt safe there and the office always worked with me whenever I had any one off situations. Stephanie is awesome and always did her best to help me she deserves a raise or promotion, she really cares about people and tenants. However, 9920 has undergone new management and they appear to be money hungry. They've raised the rent super high and screw people out of their money. I moved out and they pretty much claimed that my apartment was damaged etc. there were a few issues like the carpet but that was their fault because when I renewed my lease they were supposed to send someone to clean it but never followed through. The paint was chipped when I moved in there and the tub was painted and the paint started to fall off after I showered a few times in it. I would caution people when moving out because they'll screw you over. Also, the apartments are really nice but they're overpriced especially for that area. I moved and my insurance went down $56. I really didn't want to leave a negative review, but they screwed me out of more money than I needed to pay. They tried to go over the info with me but it doesn't make sense, it's like someone trying to convince you that the sky is red but you know it's really blue."
3,4,Ms.Rodriguez is one of the best person to talk too if looking for a an apartment at 9920 on the other hand there whole staff plays a wonderful part in making sure you got what you were looking for and provides a comfortable space for you to sit and speak. Thanks to there maintenance my new apartment was in tip top shape I appreciate you guys over at 9920 apartments thank you and love my new space.
3,5,"I absolutely love living in these apartments. It's quiet and private, and sometimes I forget that I'm not in an actual house yet. The manager and staff are extremely friendly and helpful, and they always makes sure we're in great shape when we cross paths. The property is kept very nice and you really feel like they care about making it a nice place to live."
3,5,"I love living in 9920 apartments. I have lived here since July of 2013 and renewed my lease for another year.  The complex is very safe and maintained with lots of walking space and grassy common areas for my young daughters to play outside of the street. For a bit there was an issue with dog poop but they instituted stricter policies and almost every area has poop bags now and I haven't noticed any bad smells in grassy areas. The design of the apartments feel more like condos because there aren't that many units per building and they all have garages. 

Regarding interiors, I live in a two bedroom and have seen the smaller three bedroom. My two bedroom apartment has huge rooms but the master is a bit oddly shaped and my king size bed is a tight fit. My queen bed fit fine but if the bed is king and larger it's a tight fit. The bathroom is very large you can fit a twin size mattress in it in terms of length and it has two sinks with lots of cherry wood cabinets. I am not crazy about the bath/shower, it's a plastic material that gets dirty immediately after cleaning but it is softer and that has been good for my toddler. The shower rods in both bathrooms are round and really add an elegant touch.  The closets are walk in-with wood shelving & plenty of room.  The carpet in my apartment is light beige which is pretty but not ideal for kids. The apartments has floorboards, very pretty wide doors and I love all the window blinds, they aren't the cheap mini blinds, the apartment has a lot of extra touches to make it look and feel nicer overall. The blinds in the glass sliding windows leave a bit to be desired in my eyes but they do the job. Tile in kitchen and bathroom is ceramic and the color is light but forgiving. 

The office staff, Lisa, Michael and Deea are always friendly and courteous and go the extra mile to take care of any issues or concerns I have. I work 14+ hour days during the last month of the year and Lisa and Michael really were flexible during the renewal process and took the time to explain all my options and work with my schedule. 

Maintenance is prompt and reliable. Ricardo and Cesar greet you with a smile and I haven't had any repetitive issues or repairs  that were done poorly or without care.  The biggest issue I've had in terms of repairs was one occasion my AC broke and they fixed the same day. 

Overall, this is a great place to live and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, well kept community to call home."
3,5,"I love living here and have been a resident almost two years. Love the layout of our apartment!!! The garage is so big and spacious, patio is huge, and very quite community which is a plus. They have a pantry for food and lots of cabinet space.
Deea and Lisa are the best management. They take care of us and our very accommodating.
They take care of all maintenance issues, and make sure I get all my packages.
We are looking forward to signing another lease here
Ricardo and Ernesto are the best and take care of all our maintenance needs and come over promptly. Never have to wait long at all.
Deea and Lisa are assets to your company and they are irreplaceable. No one could ever fill their shoes. THEY ROCK!!
Just an idea, please get Dish Network in here also. i found some really great prices for cable. 
We want to stay here forever!!!!"
3,5,"I moved in January 2014. Honestly, it's 1 of the dopest places to live if you're the ages 18-30. The layouts are spacious and clean. The location is perfect. People mind their business & it doesn't even feel like a apartment.



But then I got raided in November that year & got evicted 


For marijuana. & now it's legal. The irony."
3,1,"This place has gone completely down the tubes.  This was once a very nice place,  people were much more classier, clean,  had a little more pride, not any more.  It is 100% ghetto now.  Ever been to South Central  Los Angeles? Welcome my friends this is pretty damn close.  Double parking,  drug deals, SWAT teams waking you up. Yes,  this is the new apartment version.  We even have water bugs now.  Can't wait to move."
3,1,This is by far the WORST place ever. I came as a visiting guest and parked in front of the apartment home. My vehicle was towed within an hour of being there. There were NO SIGNS anywhere within the area of parking! I had no clue where my vehicle was located! I had to walk around the facility to find a sign that was extremely small  on the entry gate that you don't even see unless you are on foot because you have to enter the code 30 feet prior to the gate and by the time you get to the gate it opens and the sign is not visible ! The company quick tow advised me that this property allows them to come and tow cars at anytime because they are a private property and can do whatever they please. This is absolutely ridiculous and several neighbors all stated the same thing! I would definitely not recommend ever living here for the simple fact they set up contracts to have cars towed with no warning or notice !
3,5,"This place is one of the nicest apartment buildings in the area. It has a park, a pool, a fitness center, free coffee and tea in the lobby area, etc...
The crowd is very friendly and pleasant.
It is kept very pristine, in tip top shape and so nice and quiet at night.
This place is fantastic for families and kids, has many upgrades and things to do.
The management is on point and the owner is frequently on the premises making sure everyone is happy and enjoying their stay here.
I like that it is close to restaurants, parks and malls.
The place is well lit and I feel very safe here.
Would recommend this place to my friends and family!"
3,1,"Stop!! Do not rent here... Let me start-Neighbors Garage under your bedroom unless you live downstairs so when they stroll in at night be prepared for you to wake up as your bed will literally shake.. Be prepared to get ran over. Cars speeding all hours of the night. If you enjoy people bumping music all hours of the night this is the place for you. It looks nice, but it's ghetto as it's better renting in the hood. The pool closes early and they are super strict after it's closed and will kick you out. If your a smoker be prepared to be harassed as this is a non-smoking community. Go green save the planet type of environment. They will harass you and kick you out. Trash service comes early so again if you work late and like to sleep it won't happen. The units inside are rigged so be prepared to have things break quit frequently. It's not piece and quit always loud so if you like quiet not for you. Office personal are terrible and rude they won't work with you. Price is way way to expensive for what you get. Honestly the worst place I ever lived and I don't recommend this place for anyone. Please find somewhere else better to live you will thank me."
2,1,I am yet another dissatisfied customer I paid these clowns 600$ to shim my valves and all they did was break my cam cap cover and strip the bolts that hold it on. And to make matters worse they didn't even shim the valves.
2,5,I called them on a Monday morning and they were out Monday afternoon diagnose my vehicle within 15 minutes and had my vehicle up and running within the hour I would recommend them to any of my family and friends.
2,1,"The absolute worst experience I've ever had.. It's worth EVERY penny to use someone else who is a reliable and trustworthy mechanic.. Not only did he make matters worse by causing more damage to car, but afterwards when reaching out to advise of the damages he caused and see if he would resolve the problem and asking him to take ownership of the damags he caused, I instead was given a complete run around and was given one excuse after the next blaming everything but himself and his faulty workmanship and basically told its "" my fault"" and granted I just had my car in the dealership for exception around 1 week prior and was told everything is fine minus the engine mounts that needed replacement... Hence the reason I even reached out to him in first place and thinking I would ""save money "" compared to the dealership costs.. And to make matters worse after all the damages occurred being put down by his so called ""customer service"" aka wife , with one nasty text message after the next. So what ended up happening in the long run is he came out and caused more damage to my car. So upfront the company comes across sincere and ones who want to help at a affordable price,  but heaven forbid you end up with a problem after they ""so called fixed it"".. Good luck to you if you choose to use them truly as they will just turn it around and blame you instead for their damages  cause along the way...Honestly it ended up costing me about three times the amount in the long run having to go elsewhere to a reliable mechanic to fix all the damages caused to my vehicle opposed to their "" repairs"".. so be ready for more money in repairs to fix everything he breaks along the way rat:her than the problem at hand if you decide to use them.. I suggest shopping around ..Like I mentioned in the beginning It's worth it in the long run.. literally!!"
2,1,"Used these guys to ""repair"" 2 motor mounts... from the moment they got to the house Mark said he didn't think the mounts were broken and didn't need to be replaced. I insisted they were broken and needed to be replaced so he did it anyways. Go figure the mounts were both broken. Test drove the car for less than a minute afterwards since it was late at night by the time they were done. The next day on the very first drive the engine overheated and we pulled over to find out we had fluid leaking everywhere. We tried calling and texting the owners to have them come look at the car and fix their wrong doings of which they stated wasn't their issue. Had the car towed to the dealership and learned Mark's job cracked our radiator, and the hose, as well as disconnecting a couple other things when he jacked up the engine to reach the mounts. So our relatively inexpensive job from Mark went to extremely expensive to have it fixed. We had the car looked at right before having Mark do the work to confirm what needed to be fixed. The dealership at that time said the car was in great shape and only the mounts needed to be replaced. These guys are very unprofessional and were texting me very unprofessional, unkind things afterwards I still have the text as proof. DO NOT USE THESE GUYS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!! YOU ARE WARNED."
4,5,"We have been going there for years. The grounds and facility are top notch. One of the best RV parks we encountered on our latest trip. There is professional security 24/7. There is a small gift shop, nice restaurant, beautiful pool and conference rooms too. We will definitely keep going there when in Vegas. One big thing that did bother me was the lack of smiles at the check in desk."
4,3,"The park is large and has a nice pool area. But if you are looking to relax in your coach, this is not the place. They have a mobile rv wash company that runs their gas powered pressure washers from 0700- quite time. I called management and the manager did not care. Clearly they are getting a kick back or something from these guys. I'm here on vacation and can't even take an afternoon nap. 
I guess I'm the odd ball."
4,4,"We have stayed at the Oasis RV Resort numerous times over the past 7 years, while staying in Las Vegas to visit family for the holidays. We have stayed in two different levels of sites.

The Oasis has three nice pools-one for adults except during the winter when the heat only one pool. The pools are clean and large with many lounge chairs around them. There are two hot tubs that make it nice for relaxing.  They have a small workout room but it has enough equipment for me to get in a workout while I'm there. 

I agree the price is a bit high but we stayed at the KOA on the other side of town during August and the price difference wasn't that big of a difference for the quality difference. We are Passport America members which get a huge discount in the summer. 

I would definitely return to The Oasis. We like the park and the staff is very nice."
4,5,"My husband and I stayed here while we attended a business conference on the strip. We would definitely stay here again. Even with so many other people staying here, the place was spotless and quiet. It was just a small fee to for our dog and there were dog pens at every corner. The pool looked inviting, though I didn't have enough time to use it. I had lunch in the cafe and the food was good and well-priced. All of the staff was friendly as well.  Looking forward to our next visit."
4,5,"Best RV Resort ever!!  24/7 security, friendly staff, cheap breakfast/lunch, CLEAN, nice pools, laundry room is great and the bathrooms are AMAZING!!  This is the place you need to stay while in Las Vegas!"
4,4,"Fancy Dancy. That place was feeling like a REAL RV resort. Checking in was a breeze. Friendly service and staff. We paid $55.00 a night.
 Nice big spots. Cement pad.
Pleanty of room for our 5th wheel with 4 slide outs. Clean and neat. 

I noticed another reviewer smelled dog urine everywhere on the grounds. Hmm...I didn't smell any dog urine while I was there. Maybe they sprayed the grass down with water?

Nice pool but one section wasn't open to the public so we ended up in a little pool. 

WIFI wasn't so great but thank God for 4G and 8 mgb of data.
Limited TV channels but who's there to watch TV? Go out and have some fun.

There's a restaurant on site along with a gift shop. 
Laundry room was small but clean and only $1.50 for using the washing machines and $1.00 for dryers.

Easy acess to interstate.
I would definitely stay here again."
4,5,"This is absolutely a resort.  In the RV world that word... resort... is misused a lot. They should get ranked like hotels from 1 to 5 star.   The Oasis RV Resort is awesome.  Great amenities.  Fabulous property,  great location, great staff.  We were very happy here.

This is a great location for Vegas nightlife, catching a show or day trips to Death Valley,  the north rim of Grand Canyon or scouting Area 51!

This was a perfect ending to a 9 national park tour."
4,5,"This has to be the nicest RV park in Las Vegas or maybe even the state of Nevada. They have it all, exercise room, two pools with sandy beaches, convenience store, breakfast and lunch cafe, ballroom, meeting rooms, gate guard, dog parks, horseshoe pitching, level RV sites, full hookups with cable TV, WiFi if you want it, beautiful grounds and nice people who work there. I've been there maybe 5 times in the last 15 years and every visit is positive. I've always been given a pull through without even asking. It's only about four miles from the middle of the strip so it is pretty convenient."
4,5,"My wife and I recently stayed at Oasis Las Vegas RV Resort for a week during our cross country trip. We have stayed at many resorts and this one is by far one of our all time favorites. The property and staff were all 5 Star, and the resort is centrally located just down South Las Vegas Blvd. Thank you for a great time in Las Vegas!"
4,4,"Nice place. Very helpful guest services . One suggestion! Plant trees/shrubs around the ""RV Storage"" section and we would think we were looking at a ""Oasis"" in the desert . Instead of parked RV's."
4,5,Very nice & clean RV park near everything...outlet mall and strip. Nicely heated pools-- one for kids and one for adults. Excellent jacuzzi with strong jets. Snack bar & restaurant. Nice work-out room with good equipment.
4,3,"It was nice and clean, with lots of nice rigs, but didn't quite have the extras that we had been sold with.  I.e. it's casino was an area in the gift shop roped off with 4 slot machines, and the bar was in the restaurant that was only open through lunch.  A true Resort would have had more amenities."
4,4,"This place is clean and nice! We stayed for New Years and it was great! My only issue was with the gym it was old and outdated machines from the early 90s. Other then that the pool, rv spots and park are nice. We will define be returning again."
4,5,Stayed here with our RV while attending a Veterinary Conference. It was quiet and well maintained. We weren't there much but no one bothered us while we were there and it felt like our RV was safe while we weren't there....well except for the newbies in their rental RV that left their outside light on all night blasting into our bedroom. But this wasn't the parks fault and the park was well lighted.
4,4,"My family are huge road travelers and we've been in every kind of stop you can imagine.  There have been parking lots, KOAs, sweltering middle of nowhere places with no amenities, gorgeous RV resorts with more features than a 5 star hotel, quiet spots nestled into the environment of the places we've visited.  That being said, Oasis Las Vegas was unexpectedly nice for being in the middle of the desert.  The park was very well maintained, pretty close to the city (though not really close enough to walk as my husband and I found out- we ended up calling a cab).    We had full hook-ups, two swimming pools and a jacuzzi (although they seemed over chlorinated- we could smell them from a distance), and a nice clubhouse with a gym.  If I go to Vegas with an RV, I'd stay here again."
4,4,"Very nice RV resort. It has two pools, hot tub, gym, café, store, ball room, movies, laundry, horse shoes, dog walks, putting course, cable TV and of course showers and bathrooms.
It's close to the strip, Fry's Electronics, Whole Foods, shopping, restaurants and theaters.
The sites have picnic tables, water, electric and sewer. No tent camping.
Our site has grass and is a pull thru.
Pet's are allowed. They do have a no pet section. Three dog's are the maximum, county ordnance. They have several dog walk area's throughout the park, with baggies to clean up the dogs droppings. Unfortunately, some people are above cleaning up after their dogs.
As far as the no rigs over ten year rule as someone else has mentioned, it not quite like that. They need to see your rig and give approval if its over ten years. From the looks of some of the rigs in here, its not that strict, so unless your driving a real clunker I wouldn't worry.
This is also a monthly park, which is great if you are a snowbird, I have spoken to a few locals that also stay here."
4,4,"Very nice, clean & affordable! Front office, rec room & pool area gorgeous inside & out..One of the best we've stayed! Our site was spacious, clean & grass well maintained. Deserves 5 stars  but encountered some problems:
 
1st: No dog enforcement -Peeps tend to ignore dog rules allowing dogs pooping on prohibited areas instead of designated area.
. 
2nd NO ""Non Smoking Section"" -Resort has no smoking policy or designated area whatsoever. We had nearby smokers and wow was intolerable. I understand it's Las Vegas but allow a clean air zone for non smokers! Don't think would negatively impact business.....:-(

Despite having some hiccups we had beautiful time & would definitely be back!  Hopefully, they listen to their customers and implement a non smoking policy........"
4,4,Very professional staff.  Good security.  Superb bathrooms. Cemented and flat pods.  Would get a five except for the location near airport and freeway.  Environmental noise almost unbearable.  Re-locate this RV center to a quiet desert and you've got the RV resort that people will want to move in permanently.
4,5,"Beautiful resort, reasonable rates, well laid out with private restrooms and showers.  Easy access to local casinos and stores"
4,3,"Nice but NO privacy between rigs in premium plus...
Tons of rules and immediately asked if I had a ""pitbull"". I have chihuahuas but sad to hear they discriminate. 
Sooo big, soooo many people. Not very many at the pool in November. 
Laundry room busy. 
Showers nice and clean, needs vents or windows, gets steamy"
4,5,"This is one of the best rv parks I have been to!  We arrived at 2 am due to traffic and were greeted by the security guard at the main entrance.   He filled out all the paperwork and sent us into the main lobby where another security guard finished the paperwork.  The security guard (wish I got his name) hopped in his golf cart and guided us to our site since it was dark!!    Wow.  What service.    This place is amazing.  Heated pools w an adult pool separate from the kids pool. Wi-Fi was good at our site (463) because our chromecast even worked.  The breakfast at the cafe was tasty and the prices you can't beat those anywhere.  The only thing is with dogs you have to use the dog runs for pee and poop.   If you get caught you get a 25 dollar fine.  But our dogs a couple of times had to poop out of the dog run (because who can predict when your dog has to go lol) and we just cleaned it up with no harassment.   The park is huge here.   The 18 hole putting course is huge, fun and super nice.  There's always activities here too, like shows, bingo, karaoke and even church on Sunday at 10am .  We took lyft to the strip which was about 10 dollars each trip. Not bad. They even have a few slot machines in the store if you really have that urge to gamble!!  We will definitely be back.   Book ahead of time because this place fills up quick and they do not have a waitlist for openings.  If you want to see if they have an opening because of cancelations you have to call them and pray for one.  We did and there was an opening.  Hallelujah!!!  Thank you oasis rv park.   P.S you need to start selling beer again in the cafe!!"
4,1,"I flew in early before the rest of my party. I waited in the lounge area for an hour or so, and while on a phone call the security guard told me I was loitering and to get out! In the middle of the business call.
He told me I fit the profile of a vagrant with my backpack and scruffy face. 
Awesome first day."
4,5,Absolutely loved our time here. It's a beautiful park in close proximity to the strip. The sites are large enough to where you don't feel cooped in and there's lots of things to enjoy within the park.  They even have a cafe for your convenience. We will definitely be back.
4,5,"This is the second time we have stayed at this RV park. It is always immaculate, has every thing that we could ask for, the employees are friendly and seem to enjoy there jobs. I  recommend this resort to anybody in this area."
4,5,Came to this place for a pit stop on our vacation and loved it. Very clean and well maintained location. I would highly recommend this place
4,5,"Love, love, love this resort. The staff and guests are awesome. Beautiful location for a one night stay or monthly stay. Clean, with great amenities. A special shout out to Sue and Gary Johnson, who were instrumental in us staying at Oasis. Thanks Oasis, see you in May."
4,1,"Watch out for these folks if your doing an extended stay.
I came here after selling my home. They got me for 875 to move in and 700 for next month. They also charged me 85 in power, and I was at work 10 hours a day..  
                          
Their WiFi is horrible, bring a book to read.. It's too bad , I have worked at the Venetian for 17 years and was hoping to recommend to the 9000 employees and their familys.
Go to RV parks on boulder highway.  The airport traffic and freeway traffic is enough to rattle your Brain.
One and done Oasis. ADIOS"
4,4,"Tips:

CHECK IN - First, check in with the security guard, where he will document your license plates, and then direct you into a parking space to park, while you walk into the lobby to check in.  If you are a NEVADA resident, you will receive a nice little discount. 

RULES - There are A LOT of rules in this park, and full time security staff driving around making sure you are abiding by their rules.  So, this may not be the place for you if you are a wild and crazy bunch.  We are pretty mild, but the park did have kind of a ""stale"" feel to it.  BUT, we only stayed one night.

AMENITIES - The pool is GREAT, and stays open until 11pm.  I enjoyed swimming and cooling off after a scorching hot day, until about 10pm.  The bathrooms are clean and well kept.  However, the shower head was pretty gross.  They need to be dipped in CLR and disinfectant.  Laundry facilities were in perfect working condition.

LOBBY - Does not open until 7am.  So if you are an early riser looking for some coffee; make your own.  By 7am, it's a thousand degrees outside, and coffee is the last thing on my mind.  

RV SITES - I rode around on my bike to check out the grounds.  Sites 300-308 and Sites 400-413 are the best in the park.  They are the Premium and Premium Plus sites, but I will pay more next time for the shade!  All of the sites are just big enough to fit your rig, a car/truck and a picnic table.  (We pull a 30' goose neck with a full size dually)  Don't expect a whole lot of ""personal"" space.

STAFF - Very friendly and accommodating.  

SECURITY - I felt very safe in this park.  No shady characters milling around, and everyone who drives in, MUST check in at the security booth.

We will stay here again."
4,1,"I wrote a review for this Resort Banquet space they have and they took it out.
just to let you know i was writing review for Oasis Rv Resort Banquet space and not oasis banquet space.
  We booked Oasis Resort Banquet space for an Anniversary Party May of 2014. Horrible Experience dealing with the staff to coordinate. They kept on changing there mind on things we could and couldn't do or use.
  On the Day of the Party gave us hard time with music noise. At the end of the party they mentioned we need to clean up all the debris on the floor.
 I party was kind of a disaster because of light effect and  them bugging us with everything"
4,5,"My family (wife, 3 kids and 2 dogs) took a long road trip last year and when we arrived at Oasis -- we stayed, far longer than we originally intended.  We had a 39' 5th wheel trailer and there was plenty of spaces available, all pull through.  The staff was friendly, the facilities were great and we loved the restaurant (including the prices!).

We extended our stay to spend thanksgiving there and the park had a potluck thanksgiving dinner - where they supplied the turkey, some of the fixings and the drinks.  It was a warm and friendly gathering of all those staying at the RV Parks.

The dogs also loved the large fenced dog run at the front of the park -- and also there were smaller fenced areas inside the park where the dogs could relieve themselves without any inter-dog conflicts.

If we ever come through Las Vegas again we'll be sure to stay at Oasis again!"
4,5,Enjoyed our stay here.  We will be back.  We especially enjoyed our Friday evening with R Fox entertaining us.  What a wonderful performer with a truest heart apparent.  Look forward to seeing him again.  Beats anything on the strip for sure.
4,4,"Stayed here with my travel trailer and three kids this past week. I really thought this was a great park. The staff here was fantastic. We had problems with our tow vehicle while we were here and the staff was very flexible and accommodating. The park is very clean, although we still had problems with people not picking up after there pets. 

The pool area was very nice. There is a kids pool and adult pool area. Not sure why they decided to put a sandy beach at the kids area. There was sand in the pool and I had no desire to sit in the sand. It's not like we were at the beach. There were very few lounges in the family area as well. Interesting that they made the family pool out of the U shaped pool since you can't see your kids if they swim to the other side. Seems like a safety issue to me. 

Bocce ball and horseshoe pits, nice grass areas around the premium sites, pretty landscaping, nice picnic tables and ample dog areas all made this park a winner. We will stay here again. The park was compatible for the very small to the maxed out luxury class A rv's.  There are no fire rings."
4,5,"Clean, quiet and easy to access sights. Super pet friendly & the kiddo's loved the pool (heated during the cold season to a pleasant bath tub temperature)... Priced competitively, my family will definitely be back :)!"
4,2,"It's an ok place to stay. Most of the people who have written reviews are really only there a few days or aren't as aware of what goes on. 
The grounds are great the restrooms and laundry rooms are very clean. Although the laundry rooms tend to have a lot of machine issues. Mostly because they book everyone on one side of the park. So if you go to the laundry rooms where there are less people you won't have many issues. The maintenance staff and security staff are awesome and great people. The front desk and store staff.... less than stellar. There are really only a couple people in those two areas who actually go above an beyond the rest like to use the phrase ""it's the rules"" or ""I don't know"" or ""we are all booked"" instead of actually helping you they are on auto and pretty much read from a script. 
There are A LOT of rules. And I mean a lot. The pet policy is a page long and there are some incredibly ridiculous rules on it. I have heard from other guests who had page long policies on bicycles and scooters and skateboards. I think the rules are over the top and they don't always enforce the rules unless they don't like you or you have a neighbor who is a dick. The speed limit is 10 and they DONT enforce it at all there are always people speeding in the park and it's honestly not safe for kids to be out riding or playing. Despite the ""if you want to stay you must obey"" speed sign I have never seen anyone kicked out for speeding. 
There is a lot of favoritism in the park so if you can be fake with the front desk you can have an in and get away with a lot more than others. 
A few people have complained about the long term residents on here and there are really not that many long term residents. If you come during the winter there are a lot of snow birds or snow bunnies whatever they call themselves but there is no issue with them. The biggest issues are with the short terms or the weekenders they usually break a lot of rules and are loud during quiet times. (No not all but that's the group that have more problems than the long terms or snow birds) 
The pool areas are very clean they rake the sand in the family pool everyday and clean both pools everyday. Like I said earlier the bathrooms and laundry rooms are really clean for public restrooms and laundry facilities. 

My two stars is based on the front desk staff and the favoritism as well as the over the top rules. I honestly doubt we will be back to that resort especially since circus circus is making their rv area better. I don't like being in a place where I have to worry about getting a knock on my door cuz the neighbor is mad that the empty spot has been taken and they find something to fine you for. 

Also this is not an adult only RV Resort we ran into a lot of people who are constantly irritated about kids being there and like to cause problems. So if you have pets or kids just be cautious. Your kids might get hit by a car that's speeding and you might get kicked out for a pet policy issue."
4,4,This place is enormous! It's kept clean and safe two extremely important things to me. There are pools and other activities to partake in but in the winter we didn't use them. Maybe if we decide to come back in the Spring/ Summer we would definitely us it. It's quiet and the restrooms have single showers. They are kept clean and the pressure and temperature is nice. There is a security person at the entrance 24/7 which I think is top notch! We will be back!
4,2,It's really quite a nice place. The problem is they have terrible Wi-Fi. It's definitely their service provider LV.net. They just don't seem to care enough to do anything about it. I'm not asking to stream movies. I just want to get my email and surf the web. It's virtually impossible. I can't do my simple work tasks here.
4,2,"We were monthly tenants at Oasis, they said they had internet. We found out it costs $50 per month per device and it doesn't work.  It took me 2 hours just to read my e-mail.  Its a great aprk if you don't need internet, if you do stay away!"
4,4,"We made a quick stop on a hot late summer afternoon for one night.  I was pleased with our check in, the staff was pleasant and accommodating although he assumed he was giving us a pull through that we could stay hitched up with and this was not possible due to location of sewer hook up. (In the middle on all sites I noticed)
Definitely required unhooking our truck from the trailer if we wanted sewer. 
Another item regarding maintenance..... several empty sites and ours was only one with total mess on both sides with old dates from date palms. Date palms were nicely trimmed so sure why this site had all the dates still. 
Nicest part of our stay was swimming in the adult pool the following morning (and using the hot tub).
Pool was clean, well maintained, and perfect summer water temp!  With the 12 noon checkout time this gave us the morning to enjoy the pool."
4,3,"***WIFI IS NOW FREE***

1. The place is a concrete jungle, but most sites have a little strip of grass.
2. It's fairly secure, clean, etc.
3. We had an issue.  (BIG issue) I was able to have a sit down with the manager and it was (mostly) worked out to my satisfaction...
4. They have different preferred vendors they'll allow into the park to come work on your rig or wash it, etc.
5. The dog area is pretty big and really barren...and the only way I found to get to it was to leave the park and go around the front!  There's a gate, but it's locked.
6. The pools and hot tubs are nice enough and the other people were plenty friendly!
7. It's good that the other people are nice because you're kinda right on top of your neighbors.

Overall, I'd stay there again if I had reason to be in Vegas...but this isn't some place I'd go to go there.  (Unlike the review I left for a park in Felton, CA.)"
4,5,"A great RV Resort for families and retired folk. Very quiet and lots of grass. Concrete pads, nice showers, pool with a sandy beach which is slightly separate from their adults only pool. If you can get a spot 300-310 they are close to the pool and have shade. Shuttle to the strip."
4,5,First time staying here and fell in love with it. Very clean and well maintained. I highly recommend it!
4,3,"Pools are nice, small cafe with acceptable food. Small store. Handy to the Strip, but there is so much more to Vegas .

Extremely hot, little shade unless you are willing to pay for Premium Spaces, which will run you about $60/ night..  
 
Pet areas are just gravel with chain link fence.
One laundry room for the whole park. Some bathroom buildings, but don't expect hot showers. This water is tepid at best. One must ponder how these showers get disinfected.

Better than this is the LVM Resort, two miles west, with four pools, tennis, state of the art fitness center, lots of grass, pet areas, and over 1000 trees.  LVM.com.

If you don't have and don't want pets, be sure to book your space in the No Pets Allowed area, which is ample, spread out, and has virtually five or six spaces between the rigs. Ask for this area if you want peace and quiet, minimal traffic.

The front desk tends to force many rented R Vs in the front right of the park, resulting in tight spaces and heavier traffic.


Arizona Charlie's is a viable alternative, runs a few bills less per month. Has many interesting spots to eat at, casinos, etc."
4,3,"For a short term visit this is a great location - close but not on-top-of the strip action.  It is also close enough to off-strip locations like M Resort, Silverton, and all the Station Casinos.

It is very well maintained - but dont be fooled by the 24hr guard gate. And altho there are golf cart security 'patrols' dont leave things of value out - bicycles especially.  We had two bikes stolen.

Its one of thew few places in LV that do long term - as in monthly - stays.  Many years ago it was the pretty much the only place for construction workers ...

There have been numerous changing of the guards in management and each tells tales about their predecessor .. the current GenMgr runs the park like a hitler-camp tho making it most unpleasnt for monthly stays.  

Wish they paid more - MUCH more - attention to their laundry facilities - with all the housekeeping carts cleaning the bathrooms (dont/didnt use them tho) they should be wiping down their washers and dryers like a well run laundry does.  Charging $1.50 per wash and $1,00 per dry seems fair price - but it seems too that they would keep the place cleaner.

A bigger beef tho is that when you stay monthly you are charged for elec - thats fine BUT they charge DOUBLE what they are charged .. seems not right ... 

As far as front desk people theres a regular crew and then always a new face or three ..  With the trickle down effect - and the new mgmt being unwelcoming theres been a very perceptible shift in personell too."
4,5,Beautiful well kept park with lovely pools and helpful staff.  This will be our go to park anytime we need to come to LV.   Even have services there for washing your RV if you need a helping hand.
4,4,"This park has about 1000 site, all full hookups, all for RVs (no tents). There's an entire section of the park for pet-free guests. It feels a bit ""spartan"" when you arrive and look for lots of trees, but remember: this is a desert!

Monthly sites aren't too expensive, but the electricity costs will get you! 24-hour security is nice to have, though they can be kind of sticklers about your speed coming up or down the driveway.

There are several parks and dog parks throughout the resort. Two swimming pools and a spa-- unfortunately, the park is not great about enforcing the ""18+"" rule in the adult pool and spa, so you sometimes have to deal with younger guests in the spa.

There are activities almost daily-- mostly poker and movies. As a resident, one thing I wish they offered for monthly guests is a reservable ""clubhouse room"" that didn't cost an arm and a leg for small parties or guests.

Other than that, it's one of the best RV parks in Las Vegas."
4,3,"Nice entry, nice office and pool area. However if you want to stay monthly, only certain sites available and they will charge you a minimum of $81 to change sites. An extra $20 per month to have mail forwarded. Some sites you have only 2 ft from the back of the next rig, to your front window. Little privacy or room. A little pricey for what you get in terms of site space. Much less expensive at Las Vegas RV Resort on Nellis Blvd. Many rigs in storage at this RV park right next to your site."
4,4,"Very nice resort but busy. A lot of people stay here. We had a '44 Toyhauler and damaged the side at the front entrance. Swing wide, really wide there is a wall that has been hit a lot... they should remove it. Streets are tight too for that big of a rig. All in All, very clean and friendly people, has everything, gym, pool, jacuzzi, store and restaurant."
4,5,"Spent 5 days here. We didn't get a chance to really use the resort. And, it was all very clean , well laid out, inexpensive, and quiet."
4,5,"I can't say enough about this place. First off, safe and secure, uber close to the strip less than $15. Checked in with my wife and she dropped my wallet somewhere, next thing I know security is knocking returning it, I didn't even know it was missing. They have a great store, pool restaurant, the place rocks!"
4,4,"Great location, close to the Town Square Mall and the Premium Outlets South.  We stayed four nights.  Place was pretty quiet, except for airplanes. We were in spot 126, a pull through site.  Site included a small palm tree, rocks, and a picnic table.  Pushy time share sales person in the clubhouse."
4,5,"Never knew about this place until doing an online search last weekend.  Glad I found it, this place is very nice.  Very easy access from the freeway and easy to maneuver in.   I stayed 3 nights.  If you aren't looking for a loud rowdy place, this place is for you.  Seemed to be a very decent crowd here.  Having camped in many southern California RV parks, this place seems pretty roomy.  There are a ton of amenities, I think it stands up to the ""resort"" part of their name.  Plenty of Security and other employees driving around the grounds to deter would-be thieves.  I will, without a doubt, be back to this RV Resort."
4,2,"Oasis has gone downhill in the past two years. Landscaping is beautiful as you enter the park but really rough around the sites. Smells like dog pee everywhere. Spa didn't work and I reported it three times and on the last time the lady at the front counter who called maint and was told they were working on it. I walked back out and there was no one working on it so I told the front counter again. A moment later a man in a uniform came to the counter and was obviously perturbed. He turned to me and angrily stated that he was working on it. I asked if it might be working soon and he stated that the heater was out but that in his opinion I should go ahead and use it anyway. I told him I felt it was too cold and he stated that it was 98'. I told him that I didn't believe that was any warmer than 90 and he said if you don't like it don't use it. I overheard the lady at the counter make a suggestion to him and he shouted ""don't tell me what to do!"" The ladies at the counter are awesome by the way!"
4,5,"They have 24 hour check in, the place is extremely clean and secure, its close enough to the strip but also far enough away so you can sneak in or out of town back to CA and avoid traffic.... the facilities are simple and clean, well maintained. Very happy staying here, it is worth the money. No hidden fees or BS like most other places in vegas. Easy online reservations, we keep coming back for more. It is a very quiet park even when its packed with no empty spaces, everybody is very courteous and its a pleasure to stay here. I don't want to leave this review and give away out secrets.... but here I am."
4,5,"This was the first night of our 3 week RV trip across country.  I've been to Vegas too many times to count but this was the first time in a RV and staying somewhere other than a hotel on the strip.  This place was the 5 star hotel of RV Parks.  When it says Oasis, it means it.  The place was HUGE!  The pool was just like one your would find at a hotel on the strip.  Clean private bathrooms, large sites, modern laundry facilities.  It was right across the fwy from Silverton so there was a casino close by.  This place is definately living up to Las Vegas standards!"
4,4,"Oasis RV Resort is a great place to go RVing while in Las Vegas.  The sites are clean and level, the pool area is nice, the sports bar is fun.

While I was there, I had my RV detailed and they did a great job.  I will be back!"
4,5,"This park is one of the best we have ever been to. When we arrived someone was still in our spot, they made phone calls and arrangements for us to hang out in another spot until ours was available. Spots are good size and have excellent water pressure, cable tv worked great. The store has everything you need. The food and service in the restaurant at the clubhouse is very good. Only open for breakfast and lunch though. Pool is very nice. Also has a number is dog relief spots, just wish for a few more grassy areas. Easy access to this park from any direction. Already planning my next trip and this is the place we will stay. We had to leave a day early due to family issues and they had no problem crediting us the one day."
4,5,We have stayed here twice.  Love it.  Spotless.  Tight security.  Super pool area and clubhouse.  100% on all counts.  Decent wifi too.
4,5,"We have stayed at this resort over a dozen times. The reservation process is simple & quick, just give them a call. We are a very long Class A motor coach & they always have an open spot for us. We do not travel with kids or dogs so we don't use a lot of the amenities, but there are 2 pools, 1 just for kids. There is a large fenced in dog park just outside the front entry & a smaller one inside the park. There is also a ""No Pet"" area for people who prefer not to hear dogs.
I  find their shower/restroom facilities clean & functioning. This is NOT the park for you if you want to have a loud, crazy party all night long. This park is quiet & tidy which I s exactly why we choose it!"
4,4,"Hands down the nicest place we have ever stayed.   It's just a short drive to the Strip!  Large level spaces with  picnic tables.  Two beautiful heated pools, nice little restaurant and excellent security guards patrolling 24 hrs a day.    The bathrooms a large and clean with excellent water pressure.  This is a huge Rv park with over 700 sites.    We stayed 4 nights and the park was sold out.   With all those trailer it's amazingly quiet at night.    Check in is very easy and Cici was pleasant and nice.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a shuttle system to and from the Vegas Strip."
4,5,"The whole family agreed that 5 stars is fair. This nice property makes it extremely easy to bring your RV, and dogs, and kids to see sites in and around Las Vegas. Lots of nice conveniences. The dog runs are great. We put our 3 in their own play yard and didn't have to worry about what other dog might be coming in with them. It had a high-end feel, gorgeous rigs, awesome pool, loved the trash cans at each site, spacious showers, 24 hour security at the gate, nice shop where we got cute souvenirs at a decent price. There is a gas station right down the street so you can fuel up while unhitched. The crowd here was mostly older, but there were numerous other families like ours, and everyone we came across was laid-back and friendly. The sites do not offer much in the way of privacy, but we weren't there to sit around outside the rv, we were there to sightsee! I will say, I was relatively concerned about how uptight the staff might be after reading the numerous rules and policies, but we didn't run into any sort of issues."
4,4,"Nice RV Park.. Needs some updates.. The bathrooms are clean but could use an update like a shower bench you can reach while in the shower.. As it is now you have to walk across the slippery floor if you forget something in your shower bag. More space around the sink. No place to put your stuff. 

Laundry rooms need a really good cleaning. The dryer vents really need vacuumed. 

Pool is nice. I like the separate adult & kids areas.

Dog parks need a good cleaning. They stink like urine.. Need more gravel & power wash the fence.. Also empty the garbage cans more then every other day.. 

Horseshoe pits waste of space.. No one ever uses them. Take them out & put in a playground for the kids with grass & covered picnic area.. And maybe Bbq grills. 

Wifi is ok. Spotty if you have trees in the area.

Cable needs updated with more channels. 

I would like a better area for my dog with grass & maybe a dog water feature. Its hot on his paws walking on the blacktop & gravel.."
4,2,"So... Kind of mixed emotions on this place that lean towards dissapointed. Spots are level and clean, bathrooms are clean, but a long hike if you need a shower or to do laundry. Wifi is slower than 90's dial up, so don't pay extra, but cable has a ton of channels. Pancakes in the cafe are delicious, as is the breakfast sandwich, and the sandy beach kids pool is awesome!!

But then.... 

Staff is so so. It's a resort. It's a destination. Please excuse me for assuming staff has some level of Las Vegas awareness. I asked if there's a shuttle to the strip, the best answer was, ""No, just Uber it."" Then I ask where I can get a good burger, apparently the ideal staff answer is, ""I'm not from here. Sorry."" 

Better yet, it takes quarters to do laundry, so when I ask to trade $2 for quarters, the best answer I got was,  ""Sorry. No quarters until later. Come back in a bit."" 

But, bar none, my favorite moment was when we went to attend the karaoke night and the reply was, ""Karaoke night is suspended indefinitely. The couple that host it are on a cruise.""  OK, then take it off the resort calendar since running the karaoke machine is WAY beyond everyone else. Hope the pancake guy doesn't go on a cruise... 

Lastly, the ""10 mph speed limit, strictly enforced"" is a joke. Fat, selfish RV people speed by all day long and neither they, nor anyone from resort actually give a damn. So keep the littles close, because the speed limit is a myth. Really not a family safe place. 

Can't really promise I'll be back. Oh! And it's really classy that they have an on site RV wash van, until they run the water compressor to wash the RV next to you at 7:15am. Good morning!! Welcome to Las Vegas!!!"
4,1,"Unfortunately, this was the farthest thing from an oasis. I am writing a review in that hopefully this resort will reconsider its dog policy, which is anti-pitbull or anti any pitbull type dog. This is a discriminatory and outdated policy. While we were told the resort was anti-pitbull we did not think it would be a big deal, though the lady up front was very rude about their policy. As we read through the some 20 or so point rules for pets, we came to feel this facility is not as pet friendly as advertised on the website. We walked our dog late at night on our 1st night stay and found one of the dog runs that had signage that stated the area was under surveillance and that those found not cleaning up dog waste would be fined $25. Under surveillance? On our way back to our spot, we saw a maintenance guy on a golf cart looking into people's sites with a flashlight. We felt super uncomfortable and talked about leaving at this point. As we further looked into the rules, which there were so many of them I stopped reading we came to the conclusion this was not a spot for us. One of the rules was that kids couldn't ride skateboards or roller skates. The rules on bicycle riding were a little over the top as well. The fact that we were uncomfortable and had to hide our very loving dog that has never had any issue sealed the deal that this was not the place for us.

Taking aside what I mentioned above, the facility is a essentially parking lot right off the freeway with sites so close to each other and people packed in like sardines. Some of the sites were next to the freeway underneath Vegas style billboards. The airport was very close as well with low-flying planes constantly overhead.

This place gets great reviews but it is not my idea of a place to relax and have fun. I seriously hope the management rethinks its anti-pitbull policy and lighten up some. 

We ended up staying one night and then leaving. To be fair, we did get a full refund as we explained our situation. The girl at the desk, who was different than the night before. completely understood and asked us to write this review, which I am now doing. We ended going to Cottonwood Cove RV park on Lake Mojave and had a wonderful time with our pitbull. We will never be back to your facility."
4,5,My home away from home i love this place wouldn't go anywhere else. Even tho i have friends where i can stay nope its the oasis for me
4,5,"Beautiful park with everything you could possible need while glamping. Great staff, nice little cafe, 24 hour security, private bathrooms, gym, 2 pools and very friendly ""neighbors"". We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and would stay at this beautiful resort again without hesitation. It was nice having some grass and a shade tree at our site and they even have private dog runs. Fox car rental is 1.7 miles away and you can rent a car for under $20 a day. I love this place!"
4,1,"made reservation by phone.  told them we had dogs.  drove 400 miles to get there and have them  tell us our dog looks like it might have pit in it.  so we could not stay.  (if I had seen these restrictions on the website, or been told about them while on the phone, ) , it would have been on thing) Last year, when we got our abused dog from the humane society, they said she was Australian Cattle dogs."
4,5,Great place to stay and great price.  The pool was fantastic on a hot day. Easy to get to from the highway. Easy to maneuver our 40 ft 5th wheel.
4,2,"This is a typical RV park. The staff is nice, but security seems to be there for show. A woman threatened to shoot us in the dog park, we called police and told security, but security let her in the park without asking for identification... and the police couldn't find her in the park. The pools are nice and so is the hot tub. It's expensive. Nothing to write home about."
4,5,"Got into Vegas *late* after some tire trouble on my Motorhome. Called them about 1:30 AM from Sloan and they answered the phone! W00t! They have 24/7 staffing, they're polite and courteous and they had a space for me:) I checked in, they guided me to my space with a golf cart. Put down my jacks, plugged in the power, and set up the beds :)

The only minor nit is they gave me a 55' pull-through space. I'm towing an Odyssey behind a 36' motorhome, and the total length of MH, Ody, and tow bar is nearly 60 feet. The space is a little longer than 55' I think, but it still barely fit. Front bumper and rear bumper were at the curbs."
4,5,"Like a lot of other reviews, this is a beautiful RV Park and definitely a resort. The wifi is slower that's Starbucks or home but not bad for phone updates. Didn't try Netflix streaming. The palm trees are everywhere, especially the nice pool. We stuck to adult pool but checked out the family pool with beach. Park is clean and well visited with room for others. Loved our stay very much."
4,4,We enjoyed our time at the oasis.   I would have given out 5 starts if the restaurant had alcoholic beverages.   The park was clean and i felt safe.   The staff was very courteous.
4,5,"We travel all over the country for work 7 months out of the year. Oasis is absolutely one of the very best RV parks we have ever stayed in if not the best. 
Staff is helpful and friendly.  Place is always immaculate.  Landscaping is extremely tidy and pleasant. We drive a 40 ft rig and there's plenty of space, we can even park our Tahoe in the spot.
They have everything you could possibly need for a enjoyable easy stay. Pool, great showers, laundry, convenience store, cafe, plug in, sewer hook up. Probably more that I don't even know about. Highly recommend this place for families or anyone looking for a great place to stay."
4,1,"We stayed here once before and had a good time, but our most recent stay will be our last.

We'd made a reservation indicating we had a dog. What we failed to see on their website is that dogs that even look like they have any pit bull in them are not allowed on the property (we later found this in their detailed pet rules buried on another webpage). Ridiculous dog discrimination but rules are rules and we get that - we've boarded our gentle mastiff/pit mix when we've encountered these restrictions before so no big deal.

What turned this into a big deal was the way the Oasis front desk person handled the situation. When learning our pooch was a pit mix the ""customer service rep"" Julie rudely told my wife she had to take the dog and leave the property immediately - we would not be checked in until the dog was gone. My wife asked for a bit of empathy - it was 112F outside, we needed to find a boarding facility for our dog, our tow-behind vehicle needed to be unhooked and cooled off before we could transport him, etc. Julie repeated that the dog needed to be removed immediately then went to get her supervisor. (Customer service tip: You can choose to be kind)

The supervisor was more helpful and had a solution instead of a demand, suggesting a boarding facility nearby. After about an hour of sitting in the registration parking area with the generator and AC on making arrangements, unhooking, etc. we dropped our dog off (K9 Kountry is awesome BTW) and were finally able to check in. An hour or so later a security guy was knocking on our door wanting to make sure we didn't have a dog with us. I confirmed this but he still wanted to look inside. Seriously?! (Customer service tip: Guests should not be treated as suspects)

Whatever. At this point we were pretty disappointed in our experience but resolved to soldier on.

Fast forward two days when I discovered during my morning walk-around that one of our two mountain bikes that had been locked via security cable to the back of our motor home and completely covered had been stolen sometime between 10:00PM and 8:00AM the night before. A security guy came and took a report but was pretty indifferent to the whole situation. Other reviews suggest this may not be uncommon at Oasis. What's surprising is how many bikes and other things you'll see unattended, unlocked and openly laying about throughout the park at all hours but those don't get taken - our locked and covered bike gets nicked.

So, between the dog discrimination, rude staff, theft of property, fully exposed RV site (I'd offered to pay more for shade in the 1/2 empty park at check-in but still got full sun - the shady and empty sites around us looked nice), and spotty/slow WiFi...we're done and won't be back.

32' Class A"
4,5,"I've been full time RVing for over a year now, and this is always the home base to return to! The staff are very nice, always with a smile and very accommodating. The resort itself is excellently maintained. Spaces are large, even the back-ins.
Never an issue (I had read a review mentioning a homeless person and stealing problem) I've not experienced that, in fact I feel safer in this community than I ever did living in an apartment complex. I walk my dog late night sometimes without a worry. 
I would highly recommend parking your rig here and enjoying Vegas!"
4,5,"I don't know how anyone could not enjoy their stay here: Good Security, guard to check you in, Lobby is what you would find in a hotel, two pools of which one is for adults (thank you!) great sites, with very good showers. Nice dog run area. Good wifi and limited cable, but it works! Thank you Oasis, after coming for almost 10 years and just recently we returned from our Mammoth Lakes trip to AZ,  we look forward to our stay with you this week, once again."
4,5,"This was our 2nd time ever using our Airstream. I was very impressed with the clubhouse, ballroom and the pools. The staff were all very nice. It's very clean. Even the shower rooms were clean and roomy. We didn't always have hot water though. All in all it was a great experience and we had fun meeting up with other members of the Greater Los Angeles Airstream club for the rally we attended there."
4,1,"Today I went on line to make a reservation for a weekend in a few weeks.  My husband and I are residents of Las Vegas and because of our work schedules we like to take mini-vacations during the weekends to local RV parks.  The Oasis RV resort looks very nice on line and we thought we would give this place a try.  Not long after I placed the on-line reservation I received a reply that stated the regulations would only allow 3 pets and because I listed that we have 4 dogs we are not allowed to spend our hard earned money at this resort.  Guess what Oasis, YOUR the loser.....we are local residents who would have likely stayed at your resort several times a year and because of this ridiculous rule you will NEVER see our business.  We have no children and our 4 Min Pins (very small dogs) are our children.  How can I chose which one to leave at home for the weekend because I can only bring 3.  Would you ask parents of 4 children to do that?  (yes I know it's not the same) but that is the way we feel about it.  Folks who own RV's that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars are usually responsible pet owners so why the rule on how many pets and how did you come up with the number 3?  We were just out at another Las Vegas RV site this past weekend and we always comment on the people that are out walking their multiple dogs like us.  So be forewarned that if you want to go to this RV resort and have more than 3 pets, do not even bother to apply.  Even those with less than 3 pets might want to re-consider going here if that is the ridiculous set of rules they come up with."
4,3,"Oasis is a high density RV park rather near the strip.  A Lyft ride costs about $10-12 to the major casinos. Nice, clean pool and hot tub for adults, and a second pool for children. Wi-Fi never worked.  No concierge service."
4,5,Love this rv park. Super friendly staff. The gentlemen at the gate are always smiling. Clean park. Super clean showers. Very quiet. Nice size rv spots. Never will stay in a hotel in Las Vegas again.
4,5,"This place seems to have plenty of space.  Very easy access, clean, safe. Has a nice pool with a sandy beach surrounding it."
4,4,"The park was nice, clean, and everyone was friendly. They have a live guard at the gate all night long, and we felt very safe there. It was very quiet at night. I didn't even realize anyone was around us. 

We loved the little restaurant. It was very good and very inexpensive. It isn't too long of a cab ride to the strip, and costs about $20 each way."
4,5,"Stayed here for a couple of nights and as far as RV parks goes its a very nice place.  The downside for us was the sheer size of the place, 700 plus sites, close quarters, bumper to bumper sites.  A plus is that it's close to the strip, 10 -12 bucks for an Uber or Lyft which is really nice.  Club house is huge, with good food.  Everything is very clean.  Very well kept place for the size.  Kids had a blast in the pool"
4,1,"Homeless problems, very unsafe, terrible cell and WiFi. Homeless people hop the fence regularly for the bathrooms and to steal things. I had my very nice road bike stolen in the middle of the day, then later at night found one bathroom littered with empty cigarette packs, and old tattered shoes in the garbage in one bathroom, and the other bathroom had a homeless guy trying to stay the night. I called security and they just kicked him out and I watched him climb the fence again 30 minutes later.

If I had kids I definitely would not stay here."
4,5,"I don't know much about RV parks but what I do know is it's well maintained, has friendly staff and a lot of amenities."
4,4,"Solid place to make your RV basecamp while in Vegas.  They have a big lot smack in the desert town just a few blocks from the strip.   It is easily accessible from the 15 fwy and across the Highway from Bass Pro and the Silverton Casino.   The grounds are somewhat an oasis with palm trees and well watered grassy patches.   They even dedicate a large portion of their grassy areas to miniature golf.  

The pros:  Full hookups, easy check-in, security, shuttle service, multiple pools, multiple services available, cafe on site, 20% good neighbor discount for residents of CA and surrounding areas to Vegas!!

The cons:  Not super dog friendly!  They offer 16x16 foot dog runs for the pups to go potty, which are on gravel and sit directly in the sun without shade so they were stinky!!!   Grass is off limits for the dogs, and their large off-leash dog park is a long walk outside their gates on the side of their property.  There is no safe walkway to the off-leash dog park and there is minimal shade there, it is all gravel.  I went at 6am and it was the only time of the day bearable to the heat there.  On my way back into the property, I was hassled by security for walking through the no-dog zone near the RV sites that are for the guests who prefer no dogs.   That was a first!!
Second con is their family pool was smallish and dated while the adult only pool was nicer.   They really don't have a sand beach pool but a sand pit around the perimeter of the pool.  It was a sufficient place for the kiddos to take a dip though.

Overall for our one night stay it was a very good pit-stop but I did feel like having a dog there was more hassle than welcome."
4,4,"Very easy access, clean, everyone was helpful and friendly. It was nice to have security and they were nice as well. The only thing was the spaces were close to one another in the standard area. But we booked very late and they only had standard spaces available. Price is very responsible and for fare. We're definitely booking in advance and staying here again!"
4,5,"This park is the best park we have ever been to in our 5 years of rv'ing. The park is immaculate, the on site restaurant and bar are amazing. Great entertainment every night with great food and great prices. So many things to do here. The management and staff make you feel like you are home. Love, love, love it here."
4,5,"(FYI - this is a 55 and over resort) This is our second year at Sunflower for the winter & baseball Spring Training. We're constantly greeted by friendly neighbors, guests, and staff. The pools had a beautiful facelift, the Tiki Bar now includes the pool and is open weekends during the winter & serves burgers/hotdogs and full dinners, and the Bistro underwent a beautiful redo to a short-order grill with yummy breakfasts, sandwiches, and salads. The exercise, laundry, showers, etc. are modern and well equipped for the traveler. The sewing, woodworking, billiards, card, & other rooms are also great & inviting, and often have other campers offering to help. I used their quality tennis, pickle ball, & shuffle board courts, horseshoe & bocci ball facilities, and a cute fenced dog park. I joined free classes (loved yoga & sewing classes), and danced to free daily entertainment! The use of almost everything in the resort is included. Love it!"
4,3,"Staff as nice as pie, and a crazy number of cable channels, but for over $60/night, one would expect a LEVEL pad."
4,1,"Went to this park with three other rv ers to reserve spots for winter 2015. When we mentioned that one of us has a service dog, the women at the front desk rolled her eyes at us. Then when she was asked ""why the eye roll"" she went and got a manager to assist us. All of us decided to get spots at Happy Trails instead. Why would a dog hater be working the front desk at a ""pet friendly"" park? 
They need to train this women to be a professional! Hello, maybe she isn't the best choice for greeting people at the front desk?"
4.5,5,I had a slow leak in my tires for the longest time and could not resolve the issue. I brought my vehicle to Phoenix Tire and they fixed the issue right on the spot! The staff was extremely friendly and Matt the owner went above and beyond for me. They really gave me the impression that no job is too big or too small. I could not be happier! I highly recommend using Phoenix Tire for anything tire or mechanical related.
4.5,5,Mother of 2 needed a quick patch this place looked friendly and quick considering the size and openness of the shop and ready mechanics((compared to other shops in the area)) certainly got my tire patched and ready filled up the air as well in other tires my daughter had to use the restroom and Was clean inside the guest services area it took 30 minutes top to me this was all around great service thank god because my daughter was sick-and the other shops looked sad run down and overall sketch I will certainly be coming back for  all tire services
2,1,"Do not rent from here. We rented a Lamborghini for my Dad's 60th birthday. We had reserved it over a month prior to his birthday. These guys called us 5 hours before our reservation to cancel it. Their reason, somebody wanted it for the whole weekend. Only 5 hours notice! They offered no options, or sympathy. In fact the guy said we should rent the Bentley instead because Lamborghini's are for young people. They ruined the whole day. There are lots of other options in Toronto. Don't go here."
2,1,"If you want to be robbed go to this place!!!!!!
They don't even deserve a star.
They are some serious crooks!!! 
Had no choice but to rent a car there becsuse they were all that was opened, gave us a an older car (didn't care).
The rim was missing but they blamed us and are now making us pay for it.
All they want to do is screw you, I wish I had read reviews before going there.
TTC would've been a better option than this place!"
2,1,"Rented a car in July through Expedia, they charged me TWICE for the rental and are now stating that they have no record of us renting a car despite the fact that I have copies of the paperwork and multiple charges on the credit card. Do NOT rent from these guys!"
2,2,I put down a deposit to rent a new silver Turbo Porsche Cabriolet. Three weeks later when I showed up the car was not there. Instead they gave me an older black Porsche S4 Cabriolet.  They gave me a great discount but still I felt duped. Make sure you specify which vehicle you want.
1,1,"Called to see if I could rent a RV from then for 4 to 5 days, and they told me that they're where none available. Then she hung up, then went on their website to see if this was so and there was one available according to the website. Then I called her back and, told her what I saw online, and she told me "" that basically the website information was wrong and, they don't like to rent to people of 4 to 5 days and only to people that want to rent for 2 weeks because of "" the busy season "". Then she told me that because I was going one way that I would then have to pay a plane ticket for a driver to go to the drop off point to pick it up, extra fees & charges ($2.50 a mile and I was going a 1000 plus miles), gas, and anything else it would cost for the RV to get back to its origin !! YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KINDING ME !!!! Sorry but these people are a bunch of rip offs, and the lady spoke me like I was wasting her time, and was extremely rude. I wouldn't recommend anyone using these people go somewhere else."
1,1,"we had rental on last year summer, the price was very high(for 7 night is over $3,500) compare other RV company we had before and people work on this company was not kind and nice.

we had car accident on the way to Las Vegas before we could pick up the RV, and 3 people was in ER room and I called them same day from ER room. and we ware stay in hospital for 3 night and after we back to home, I deal with all the reservation I made for the trip, all the company refund the $ to me. But the Bates did not, they give me 1 year credit, but after car accident my husband and I can not drive long and we provided the Dr. report, we ask for extended the credit time, but they refuse to give us more time.


never rent RV with Bates"
5,5,"$8.99 Oil Change?  Yes, please!  Sign me up!  Small locally owned auto shop on Sahara and Lamb.  Took my car in for an oil change before Labor Day Weekend this morning.  Found them on Groupon - there were others to choose from, this place had good reviews and was nearby.

A few things to know:  Make an appointment and give them about an hour to change your oil and  inspect your car.  This could be your excuse to head next door to Abuela's Tacos.

Waiting room is small-ish with cold water available and a television.  If you have major repairs that will take a while, it's probably best to leave your car and return.

The owner struck me as kind, honest, and a small business owner looking to impress new customers and build his business.   The inspection with the oil change had tons of detail and seemed  thorough. He gave me a quote for rear brakes which my car needs and while it isn't the lowest price in town, it's incredibly competitive.  

One thing I felt good about was that this is a low key shop, there was no pressure whatsoever to buy additional services like so many of the 15 minute places do.  Some people are salesman and some people are mechanics and these are mechanics. 

Additionally, there were no extra fees at all (not a cent!) beyond the Groupon I purchased.  And, instead of being greeted with disdain for using a Groupon as has happened in the past (why run a promotion if you're going to make it impossible to honor it?), they seemed pretty pleased their efforts to bring in new customers worked.

Do you feel cared for at your auto shop?  If not, I'd say to give these guys a try especially if you don't mind a little extra time taken on your car for things like an oil change, AC charge, brakes, etc.

Wish them the best of luck!"
5,5,"took my travel trailer over to one car automotive solutions to convert from 30amp to 50 service so I could run two ac and Tim not only did a neat and clean job, it looked like it came from the factory, but he was very close to his estimate of total cost. Very happy with One Car Automotive Solutions they got my vote"
5,5,"Tim was awesome! He explained everything he did from start to finish. I just got an oil change and another air filter, but he also made sure everything else was okay. Tim also made a few recommendations. His pricing isn't bad at all to. I definitely recommend this place for services and repairs!"
5,5,"A neighbor told me about this great auto service shop on Lamb and Sahara.  I needed Brakes for my 1999 Ford Ranger Pick Up.  I made an appointment and was greeted by a very nice young man named Tim.  He checked out my Pick Up and gave me a written estimate and explained what needed to be done.  In terms I could understand.  Later that day I returned to pick up my vehicle.  WHAT A TERRIFIC JOB TIM DID.  My Pick Up is just great. So glad to have the brakes working well.  We will definitely return for other work on our vehicles.  Tim really is honest and has old fashion manners and work ethics.  As a senior, this is the 1st time in my life, I have found an honest quality mechanic.  HE IS GREAT."
5,5,Great service and well done Job very Honest I don't post reviews but my truck is in great shape thanks again Tim
5,5,"This is the first Yelp review I've written. Can't say enough good things about this business. Needed new front pads and rotors for my 07' Saab Wagon. Saab likes to be a PITA and issued 4 different rotors for this vehicle, so after measuring to  find the right size for my car it also appeared they are reverse torque. Tim and Angel went out of their way to get the correct tools and parts for my vehicle. They were able to get me  quality oem parts and install them for a fraction of what the dealer quoted me. Tim gets his parts brand new from a local warehouse (support the local economy even more!) and I was there when my parts came in and took them new out of the box. He even offered the opportunity to watch him install them and gave me a handful of great advice for taking care of my brakes and vehicle. This is the kind of small, honest business you route for. Would not hesitate to take my car back here for anything."
5,5,"Tim did a great job, he was very informative. He went over everything that needed to be fixed and why, used top quality products that will last and showed me the parts that were taken out which was nice.
I will be going back for sure"
5,5,"Did My First Oil Change Here In Nevada And Nothing Short Of Great Customer Service. Service Was Fast, And Gave Me Some Pointers On A Major Problem That Could Of Became Bigger Overtime. Would Recommend Getting Your Next One Done Here."
5,5,"Tim and his team are awesome! This is the kind of proficient and dedicated mechanic one would expect to find in a small town. He does exceptional work and goes the extra mile! I've had him to two big jobs to my diesel truck, one being an Allison transmission service. He had me come back the next day to double check fluid levels and the tightness of the bolts after it had made some trips. I am beyond impressed with the work ethic and thoroughness of the service!"
2.5,1,"I called late in the afternoon and was told that a tech would call me that evening or in the morning. AT 11:30 I called them and was told a tech would call me but would be no problem being here by 2PM. 5 minutes to 2 I got a call from the tech and was told it would be a few hours!!!   NOT. Sorry but I am a businessman myself and if you can't work withing a time frame that YOU set, tell the customer to go elsewhere! Jeff, you just  really ticked off a customer!!!!"
2.5,2,Perhaps it is because I am a woman. I told Jeff on the phone what the problem probably was. Mechanic shows up and starts testing the battery and then the fuses. After researching the problem on Google they decided to look where I originally suggested.  Started work at 11 am and finished at 11:37. Wanted to charge for an hour labor I questioned it and the guy became hostile regarding my questioning him. We finally settled on 45 mins after arguing for several minutes. When the mechanic showed up he was not very pleasant so I gave him back in kind.  He felt I was hostile and I felt I was responding to his attitude. Decided not to have them fix the problem as the quote was for 2 hrs at $125 an hour.  I will take it elsewhere.
3.5,5,"Wow!!! Palm Gardens is a beautiful, well kept, clean community. They offer an RV section called The village for you to come a try out the Arizona lifestyle, and take a look around! This area has so much to do, from touring Museums, to hiking, theater, great restaurants, music etc. We Love the Mesa area because its a great home base to travel from. Everything around you is only 1 - 5 hour drive. We chose Mesa because we want to travel to California, Oregon, Montana & Utah. So this is a great place to call home! We have stayed a 5-6 other communities in the area but we always come back to Palm Gardens is the perfect Home away from Home. The people are fantastic, anything you need is accommodated and you are very well taken care of here. Palm Gardens is a medium size community, not too big, not too small. I call it the Goldilocks Park, because its ""Just Right"", If and when you're in the Mesa area, you won't be disappointed for choosing palm Gardens, whether you're have an RV or looking for a Beautiful home for the season or a permanent one!! This Park is the best in the area!!!! 
Thank You Palm Gardens!!"
3.5,1,"My husband and I were looking for a place to retire in Arizona. We saw that Palm Gardens got good reviews. Everything looked clean and in order, but unfortunately the owner is insane. We said we were looking to retire next year and wanted to take a look around. He went ballistic. Started screaming at us, saying we were wasting his time. He asked if we were spies! Thought another park sent us to get information. Wow. We walked toward our car, and he followed us, still screaming and having a hissy fit. My husband told him not to worry, we would definitely not stay there. He yelled ""We don't want you here!!!"" As we were getting into our car, he hollers ""You must be democrats!"" We wouldn't stay in this insane asylum for a million dollars."
3.5,5,"Palm Gardens isn't a retirement home but a retirement community.  It's actually quite lovely with two club houses, to pools, jacuzzi, and it's gated.  The community is welcoming and they have tons of activities for the residents.  Most residents are seasonal, and the majority of people are there from October-ish through April.  I've visited my parents home there many times, and actually really enjoy my visits.  There is Bingo, Cribbage, Hikes, Tours, Social Hours every Saturday....honestly you can stay busy every night.  I even go for a run in the mornings when I'm there - if you do the perimeter it's about 3 miles, so not a shabby work out.  The grounds are superbly well kept, and the homes are a mostly on the newer side.  You can own a home here, or you can rent.  I highly recommend it, and you can see from my photos that it's really beautiful, clean and fun.  Honestly, when my parents first told me they were buying here, I though it was insane, but now it's the highlight of my winter to go down for a visit!"
5,5,"Ryan came out the same day and took care of the windshield for my truck and for my mother's car as well (who was visiting me at the time). In fact, he also found another untreated chip in my windshield that I never noticed. He took care of my situation and the job looks really great! I have had my windshields done by other companies and I have never really been satisfied with the work, as it always looked like it was a good job. But Ryan's worked looked great and I will definitely be going back to him with my next (and frequent) chips! Thanks for a great job!"
5,5,"I was able to set up a same day appointment thanks to Matt's fast response and help setting up the claim with my insurance company. We reached out to them together so there was no back and forth trying to get information to my provider and it only took a few minutes.

Ryan the installer was prompt, professional and you can tell he takes pride in his work. It only took 30 minutes to complete and that's even with him making sure it was up to his standards by redoing part that wasn't just right. He came to me while I was at work, so I didn't have to take time away to get it done.

I also got $100 cash from Insta Auto for doing the replacement through my insurance. No catch, just free money and a perfect windshield. 

I will definitely be re-using them for future replacements and would highly recommend them to anyone."
5,5,"Ryan came out to fix my 2004 Ford Expedition Windshield. He was on time, fast, friendly. I did not use Auto Insurance and Insta Glass was the best price after calling 3 other companies! Would highly recommend!!"
5,5,"I had a huge crack on my windshield and needed it replaced before I headed off on a road trip. I requested a quote and within half an hour I received one! After looking at the reviews here on Yelp seeing that Insta Auto Glass has a perfect 5 star review for all of their customers I just had to set up an appointment. They were really flexible to my schedule and the quote was less than what I was expecting! My windshield was replaced quickly and my car was looking as good as new. No wonder they have a perfect score, their customer service and work is outstanding! Will be calling them again if I need another windshield replacement(I hope I don't anytime soon!)"
5,5,"These guys gave a good price over the phone and stuck to it, no nickel and diming like other places. Came out the same day, right on time as promised, with the right parts, unlike a large competitor we called first who misled us and didn't know what he was doing. They sent 2 guys instead of just one like the other place, so the job was done quicker and better. This company was professional, courteous, and very informative about the job and how to care for the new windshield. They are open later than other places, too, so they are open when you can't reach others. Wish more auto businesses were run like this!!!"
3,4,This is our second winter staying at this park and we may stay here again next winter. Office staff is friendly and helpful. Sites are tidy and the guests are friendly. One thing that we appreciate is that anyone who stays a month or more must agree to a background check. You also have to pay for it but it is a nominal fee. Another thing we like about this park is that it is close to grocery stores and restaurants.
3,5,"I only stayed here 3 days, off-season, but was very impressed. There are many amenities, and everything is kept scrupulously clean -- even in the off-season. The WiFi was a new system and worked well for me (older reviews seem to have problems with their older system). The greeters and staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The neighbors were nice too. Every surface is paved -- there is no greenery on the ground, but this is Arizona and nothing green would survive anyway. There are many healthy palm trees and some featured plantings including native cacti to keep things looking alive and festive, so they get A for effort in this harsh environment. I drove past many other RV parks in this area, and Mesa Spirit seemed to be among the best-maintained from my quick visual survey (but I'm no expert). People with really, really big rigs need to understand that it's not easy to change infrastructure. RV trends change much faster than you can re-engineer water, sewer, electrical lines and move streets, losing valuable space in the process. I stayed in a 30' TT and was fine."
3,5,"This is a great place to stay when you're traveling with an RV, the staff is so friendly and helpful. They have plenty of things to do, and located close to a lot of other things. 
Full hookups, cable tv, solid pads for parking. 
We'll be back for sure."
3,4,"This is an awesome RV park.  Well lit, gated, and friendly well trained staff.  Lots of activities, clean facilities, great pools & hot tubs.  Don't like all the park models, starting to feel like a mobile home park instead of an RV park.  Prices are high compared to the other parks we've stayed in, about twice the price.  The location is great, close to Scottsdale, and lots of vacation things to do."
3,1,"If you like RVing in a parking lot, you will
Like it here. It's noice place. Traffic 10mph it's a joke. People go flying tru here more like 25mph. Across from us somebody  is working on a trailer grinding for over an hour. Over $500 per week fool me once but not fooled twice.."
3,5,"We love this park! Stayed last year and it was great so reserved for this year too!!  large, double sites available for RV'ers and clean-clean-clean facilities as well as very friendly check-in and maintenance staff! Great, economical rates too!!"
3,1,"If you are staying with pets bring your noise cancelling headphones.
Terrible! They park you in the back along a low wall and the noise is terrible all night long! People next to us said they can't watch their TV outside.
The wifi also no good I couldnt use my printer and the tv channels we only got 3 very frustrating to say the least.  We should not have had to pay over 60.00 a night here and they should not charge if you have to be parked on back side and get no sleep hearing the loud vehicles all day and night. We only stayed a couple nights long enough."
3,2,"I stayed here for business. No one here during summer, but I was placed next to a fulltime resident, nothing against them, shoe-horned way in the back of the park (got lost without the map). This wasn't the worst part. I left early one morning only to return that evening to find trash from the trailer that had been demolished behind me.  My trailer was covered with dirt and dust!  From my observations, this was the only one in this humongous park.
Why would you purposely park me there when you know you are going to demolish another unit close by. Again, lots of empty spaces, no one around!
Thank you for the space, other than that, I can't think of a reason to stay here in the off-season!"
3,1,We have been coming to this park for 12 years. Very disappointed for the last two years. This year was the topper. Would never come back to this park again.  GM won't even return calls!
5,5,"Even though the shop was busy, Boyce was very accommodating and extremely helpful as he fixed my 5th wheel wiring problems and got me back on the road quickly.

I also bought a spare rim and tire.

Great job."
5,5,"Rucker Trailer Works is a professional shop. I had half a trailer I put together. They took what I started, put wheels under it. Perfectly balanced and built exactly to my specifications at a fair price. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone."
5,5,They did what work needed to be done on my pop up and did it for a fair price. I'd use them again.
5,5,Another great experience with my Nordic Boat Trailer. These guys do great work!
5,5,"Neil and crew are fantastic.  They have done a bit of work on our popup.  some welding work on the tongue, serviced the axel and repacked bearings, news tires, new 7 pin/wiring, and new springs.  Honest guys.  Very reasonable prices. They'll be doing all our trailer work from here on out."
5,5,"These guys are top-notch - willing and able to help with any facet of trailer ownership.

4,5,"If you want to buy an RV, motor home etc. this is the place. They are the friendliest people I have met in a long time. Great selection. People come from all over just to buy from here. I highly recommend this dealership. Tom Shoemaker is the sales manager. Thank you for your kindness and hospitality. Water popcorn. Also if your into retro they have the coolest cutest selection of retro trailers."
4,2,"When we bought our new 5th wheel in Oct 2017 because of the service we received. We knew that the fireplace needed to be replaced and were going to take it out not far away to test it out. We found multiple issues like the closet door needed to be replaced, the shower handles fell off, the fridge does not work correctly and many more. We called and were sent to the service dept with no help but an appointment 2 months out. We emailed our salesman to no response. We got an email from the owner to see how we like it and response with our issues, still no response. We got an email from the service dept to see how things were going and again we sent another email with our concerns, nothing. We took it in today and have no idea when it will come back, so now we have made 3 payments and canceled trips and still cannot use it. Not happy."
4,1,"BUYER BEWARE! We gave them $1000 cash down payment with the understanding we would return in a couple weeks with the rest of the cash to purchase the rv. Before we could return my husband was diagnosed with a life altering medical problem and was told he could no longer drive. He emailed to doctors diagnosis to Robert Crist and asked for a refund of the deposit. BASICALLY THE REACTION WAS TOO BAD WE'RE KEEPING THE DEPOSIT. What kind of a business are they? Obviously making a buck is priority, not compassion or customer service!"
4,5,"My husband and I highly recommend Robert Crist and Company RV. We asked them to do fairly extensive body work on our fifth wheel caused by an accident. Because we live in our rig full time, they made an extra effort to make sure that the repairs were done quickly. Their service was impeccable! The RV looks great and all the managers and technicians were very competent. A special thanks to Mike, Jane, Dale, George and Darwin. We also enjoyed talking to Frank about the latest RVs in their inventory. Everyone made an unpleasant situation much more bearable for us."
4,2,"My rating went from five stars to two stars because of the total disconnect between sales and service. 
Two tips if you plan on using this dealership. 
1. Make sure you get everything in writing as far as what they will fix and when it will be fixed. 
2. Absolutely demand that they demonstrate the fixes have been done, and that they plan on spending at least an hour going over it with you.
Things that were supposed to be fixed, were not, and when I went to pick the coach up (they had two months to fix just a few things) the service manager was absolutly unaccomidating. The two techs that did take a very cursory look left it such a state of disarray, several more systems no longer function correctly, as they did prior to the tech mucking things up. 
Zero remorse that they let me drive away with things like they were/are. I'll  have to hire a tech at my expensive to fix it.

They only reason I gave it two stars, is because of the great sales staff. The sale part was pleasant. 
I can't see a reason to ever use their service department, unless you like to be treated like crap."
4,5,"Go see Avery. No pressure. Very helpful . Didn't hover. Didn't bug us. 
I will definitely buy my RV from him. Just can't decide which one...
So , we are going back ."
4,1,"This company is overpriced and sells crappy parts that break and then they don't back their own products.  They will return money contingent on if their vendor gives them credit on something that broke prior to it ever being installed or used and blame the customer for doing it, that was their main focus rather than trying to find a working solution!  Their GM and Owner Robert Crist is an egotistical arrogant man and his sales managers clearly follow example.  STAY AWAY!"
4,1,"Buyer Beware! dealership took advantage of 90 year old lady. They Pre-sold her a  37ft Holiday Rambler and when it was delivered out of state it had all these issues;
1. they claimed oil had been changed.  It had not.
2. an electrical outlet inside coach was supposed to be fixed. it was not
3. the LP propane connector wasn't connected. how could this pass testing?
4. interior carpeting had been delivered uncleaned. how unsanitary
5. delivered with yellow check engine light on. wow, really?
6. a/c needed repairing. they claimed it just needed freon. then why didn't they put some in?.. oh yeah, bcuz it was leaking and they didn't want to disclosed that. 

Shady sales people and owners doesn't care. RUN away from Robert Crist dealership.. totally unwilling to help out or make amends to 90 year lady.. that's just wrong!"
4,5,"Garry O did a great job with me.  He understood what I wanted and didn't waste my time trying to upsell me on bigger and better.  He listened and understood exactly what I wanted.  He was very easy to deal with and sold me by listening and understanding my needs.

Thank You."
4,5,"My family and I were on the hunt for a used travel trailer that was in ""perfect condition, sleeps 6, light-weight, and under 10K, etc.""   If anyone has looked for a trailer, you know that this is very hard to find in that price range....especially if you want a barely used, eat-off-of-the-floor-clean trailer, which I did!  We met with Joe Rosten and explained our long wish list.  He didn't have anything for us in that price range that fit all of our demands.  He was easy to talk to, did not pressure us into buying a 30K RV, and was a wealth of information regarding all things RV.  We gave him our info and went on to the next RV dealership.  Not even a week later, Joe emailed me saying he found the PERFECT travel trailer for our family and immediately thought of us.   I met with him the following day and he was not kidding!  There sat a 2005 Artic Fox Travel Trailer that was immaculate inside and out.  Joe was so excited about showing us this trailer because he knew it met all of our demands on our mile-long list!  IT WAS PERFECT!  We immediately purchased the trailer.  Joe also stayed after hours to show us how every little thing worked on the trailer.  He was very very thorough and wanted to make sure we knew everything we could about the trailer before we drove off into the sunset. Joe also gave us some camping gifts including a Coleman Lantern!   My husband didn't have the correct size hitch, so the Sales Manager Mat Lebert ran to the store and bought us the correct size.  This, mind you, was AFTER hours when he could have been relaxing at home with a cold one.  Overall, this was the absolute best experience we have had buying a vehicle/trailer.  Very helpful, informative, friendly, no pressure, kid-friendly, etc.  I would recommend Joe Rosten at ROBERT CRIST AND COMPANY to anyone in the market for a new or used RV.  AWESOME EXPERIENCE!!!"
4,5,"We just had a wonderful buying experience with these folks.  Our salesman Gary was very informative and helpful, Joe made all the problems go away, Terry answered every question about how things work , and the whole team bent over backwards for us. We would highly recommend this company."
4,1,Worst customer service ever. Make an appointment for warranty repairs and they tells us they can get to it until the next day. They call to tell us its ready to pick it up still an hour later and they charged us for something without approval. Terrible place
4,1,"We thought that robert crist & company was different than the reputation RV companies have but they are no different. They clean up, charged up and covered up enough to make the sale. That's where customer service ends. They do not back what they sell. (I even asked the GM, Rick if he stands behind their product and he couldn't say yes) 
We purchased a motorhome 60 days ago!!Haven't even taken it out.
List of issues they supposedly fixed for PDI but we are now paying for: 

Serviced generator:
 Several parts we are replacing because they are 10 years old and obviously not ""serviced"". If they had, the filter would have been replaced and not air cleaned, they would have seen the bent spark plugs, and fuel filter and fuel pump is obviously in need of replacement! ($100, no including labor)

None working Outlet: 
during PDI they plugged in meter that lights up to show it's getting power instead of one  that reads the amount of voltage coming from the outlet. (Sneaky way to ""show"" its fixed)!  The outlet didn't actually power anything. IF they had actually fixed the outlet like the PDI report says they did, they would have traced it to the actual problem being  of one of the slides rubbing on the wires and causing a fire hazard!! They were totally ok with selling us a Rv that could have caught on fire by opening a slide. We wound up paying $1700 for this issue that wasn't fixed to begin with.

Slide misaligned: 
The motors on either end of the slide are not in sync so brought it in and we are being told that the seals needing to be replaced are the problem and what's causing that issue. The seals are sticky and falling apart, they cleaned up the stickiness on the slides for the pre-purchase inspection so well we didn't see the trickery in not fixing a known issue (even our PDI tech said how well they cleaned it). So even though the dealership had the Rv on their lot for over 2years somehow it's deteriorated in 60 days that the seals are what's ""causing the slide to go out of sync"". We may be first time Rv owners but we are not stupid. We know as well as they do that it's electrical and one motor is moving faster than the other. ($300 for seals). Slide repair cost still unknown. 

Motorized step: 
they ""fixed"" 3 times between the time we signed intent to buy, personal inspection and PDI. 
Got home and had to replace the motor the first week when it wouldn't go back in. ($100)

Batteries: 
were told they serviced during our PDI.  yet running the Rv for more than an hour, we would lose power.  But weren't they serviced before the PDI 60 days ago? When we pulled them out to fix them ourselves we realized they didn't have dates to show how old they were (cover up?) but based on the corrosion, they were well over 2 years old. We bought 3 new batteries ($470, not including time)

Interesting note:
At the time we called about the slide being misaligned we also got an email letting us know the rv was due for its 24 point inspection. What is interesting is when we were talking to Rick, the GM we told him this and he said ""oh yes the one year inspection"". We asked why we were getting a one year after purchase inspection notice after only 60 days of ownership? He couldn't answer. Because he knew there were problems, calling it a 24 pt inspection means we pay for repairs they find, or supposedly fixed and the fact that they don't back what they sell.  

Buyer beware. Even though we had a private inspection done, and he caught the non working outlet issue, but private inspectors don't come back for the PDI to make sure the job was done, we just made the mistake of trusting Robert Crist in fixing or servicing what they said they fixed or serviced."
3,5,"After a death in the family, my husband and I found ourselves in Phoenix last spring.  Out of all the tasks we had to complete, our trailer purchase was the easiest.  We showed up less than an hour before TrailersPlus closed and we were immediately helped by a very knowledgeable salesperson (Danny, I think).  Anyhow, we ended up purchasing a slightly more expensive trailer than we had originally planned, but it was because we could see that it better suited our needs than the cheaper option.  4 months later, we have driven the trailer across the country and used it several times since then.  It's awesome, we love it!  My husband and I were super grateful to have such great service at TrailersPlus because we were having a rough week.  The trailer transaction took less than an hour, we loved both of the guys that ended up getting our trailer picked out and hitched up, and we are entirely satisfied with the trailer itself.  Since we don't have a dealership near our home in Michigan, they assured us that we would be able to call them and find a local person to help us if we needed to use our warranty.  We really appreciate this place- thank you!"
3,5,"I purchased a 12' enclosed trailer from them back in 2009 or 2010. The trailer has been amazing. I haven't had any issues and it is great quality and the price was very reasonable. 

They would call and remind me of my free service and inspections. That was super helpful, because I'd never remember to get the wheel bearings greased and such. Since then, I've had a few issues that were user-error. I broke the rear foot and it needed to be replaced/rewelded. They did it quickly and very inexpensively too. 

Also, since I purchased my trailer, I've noticed they've rebranded the company a bit - for the better. They are totally corporate, but seem to have retained the local gear-head friendly tone and style. Not sure if there's new ownership or new leadershiop, but the new brand looks great. 

Last year I had to repair the driver side wheel well / fender and lights when a damn filthy retread jumped up and bit me. That 30lb piece of rubber did a number on that fender area. 

I took it in to Trailers Plus and they repaired it correctly, without trying to rake me in any way. They gave me all my options and their recommendation as to what they'd do if they were me. A day later and a very stomachable bill and I was back on the road. 

I asked about replacing the tire. They gave me a quote, which was a little high (since they aren't a tire co). I asked and they steered me in the right direction to buy the right tire for a better price. Incredible customer service. Did not expect that. 

The latest interaction was today. My dome light plastic case rattled off and broke a while back. I never made it a priority since the light still works. But the bulb is exposed and I know it's just a matter of time before I smash it with a tool in hand. So, I called to see if I could buy that piece of replacement plastic cover. Spoke to Christian. He informed me they don't sell that piece of plastic al a carte and that I'd have to buy the entire light fixture. 

Since mine is incandescent, he mentioned I could just buy the new LED version which is much better (and I agree!). The cost was only like $15, but he said if I wanted it shipped, I'd have to order on their website. 

Instead of letting me head off into the internet-ether to fend for myself, he went to the website in parallel to make sure I found the right part. In about 30 seconds-flat he realized that part wasn't showing on their online store. 

Guess what? He zipped over to Amazon.com, found the part in less than 30 seconds. He asked me for my email, and sent me the link. 

BOOM!
$8.95 shipped Prime. F*cking incredible. 

The whole phone call took like 90 seconds. I got a better LED light for under $9 and saved $6 - $7. 

Bravo, Christian. 
Keep it up Trailers Plus!"
3,1,Sold me trailer with all kinds of problems fenders fell off to a bent axle wearing my tires uneven. They order a new axle and told me I had install it or pay them. My wife was in hospital when axle came in. They held it for couple weeks then ship it back with no remorse for my situation after explaining what was going on and I only needed another week Now couple months later my leaf spring snaps in half maybe 500 lbs total ever hauled in this trailer.  This company sells garbage trailers with horrible customer service.  They won't fix issues even tho they sell trailers with a full warranty. Do your self a favor and go to another business if your looking buy a nice trailer with no problems
3,4,"Had work done on my trailer here, you an tell it is corporate but the service is good.  The only issue I had this first time was they took longer than expected to complete the work but it was due to an unexpected problem they ran into after starting the repairs on my trailer.  This place is huge and is right off of the frontage road of I-17 near Dunlap.  They are close to my office and I use several trailers and they offered to take my credit card to keep on file for future repairs.  This helps me out a lot and I hope we can build a great business partnership with future repairs."
3,1,Place sucks stood in the office for 10 min not a single person said shit to me... worst customer service ever
5,5,I wish I had found this place sooner. Extremely friendly and helpful. Competitively priced.
5,5,"I was traveling on a road trip and discovered I needed some fluids topped off and that I had some ""other"" engine needs to be attended to.  I was at a gas station on a major road through Boulder City.... and I felt that I needed someone to look at stuff before I headed through the desert.  I asked the guy at the pump next to mine and he said ""follow me"".  He took me to K&C auto, only a few blocks away.  There were a couple of guys chatting and having a cup of morning coffee when we pulled up.  He explained my situation and asked if I could ""leave me car""... um... no.  I explained further.  I very nice gentleman proceeded to open the hood of my car and shake his head and smile.  He immediately realized that I was a female, unknowledgeble of car stuff.  We got into a very good conversation  and before I knew it he had topped off all my fluids, filled my tires with air, cleaned my battery posts, checked and filed my oil, explained the extra hose that lead to no-where really was ok and most importantly told me what work needed to be done soon and what I needed to do at my next maintenance....
When it was all said and done he said ""ok, you're all done!""   I asked what my damaged would be and he said ""nothing"".  I was floored.  NO KIDDING!   Wow!  He could have really charged me a ton.  I was mentally prepared for the ""raping"" that could have occured. (ok, bad word).   
Anyways,  I was so thrilled, I gave him a hug and spilled his cup of hot coffee all over my feet.  DAMN!  I felt so bad.  I offered to buy him a cup of joe but apparently he had a full pot in the office and did NOT want whatever I would have been able to come up with.  
What a great guy!   Believe me.... if and when I ever get near there, I will look him up.  
I plan to send him a box of 'goodies""  (homemade expresso brownies!)

If the world was filled with more good samaritans (a.k.a. guardian angel) we'd all be better off.   

Thank you.  For being you."
5,5,"I learned about this shop through a family friend. My boyfriend and I had just bought a car, and we needed a place for it to get smogged. 

We live in Silverado Ranch so it is a bit of a drive, but well worth it! It passed and we got it registered at the DMV.

A couple weeks later I noticed it started blowing hot air out the A/C. I called them for pricing, and although they didn't give me pricing (number of things could be wrong with the A/C!) I decided to drive down there anyway, since they treated us well last time!

Upon arrival, I told the guy, Bill I believe was his name, that I had called earlier and he said, ""Oh yeah I remember you. The thing is, that kind of stuff you usually have to set an appointment. We're really busy today. but let me see if [so-and-so] can at least take a look."" 

The mechanic pulled in my car and started at it!

He put freon into the car, and also put a tracer dye so if/when it leaks out, they'll know where the leak is so it'll be easier/faster to fix! They also explained that A/Cs are a sealed system so when it does blow warm/hot air, it's got a hole/leak. I'm a girl that doesn't know much about cars, so it was nice for the small educational lesson!

I got to talking with the guys, and they said themselves: usually a small town shop like this will be up front and honest, because for the most part, their clients are local people they'll see everyday at the grocery store or school game and they wouldn't want a bad rep!

It took about 20 minutes all together and I was set...FOR BEING A WALK-IN! They are awesome guys there!

I HIGHLY recommend this shop, as you never know who to trust and who is is gonna rape you for hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars, especially if you're a woman that doesn't know squat about cars!

Unfortunately my car is blowing warm air again, but that means it has a leak somewhere, so I'm going to call them today to set up an appointment...don't wanna die in this Vegas heat!!

It can be a long drive to K.C.'s depending where you live, but I can assure you, you'll know you'll be treated fairly and won't have to worry about getting ripped off like 9/10 of shops out here in Vegas."
5,5,I have been going to KC's for all my automotive needs for about 19 years now. They are a group of honest and trustworthy guys. They are fair priced and kind as well. My last instance was an exhaust leak. Mazda wanted 750$ for the part that I needed. Parts and labour would have been close to a thousand dollars. They guys at KCs sent me to another shop in Henderson that dealt specifically with mufflers and exhaust. They sent me away when they could have reeled me in and made a bundle off me. I will continue going to this shop and I highly recommend it to anyone for any mechanical needs.
5,5,"12/8/2012 - 12/13/2012 Stayed here for 5 nights, used our Passport America discount. What an awesome place. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. We had never stayed in this type of park before and are very impressed. 

We did pick up a screw in our trailer tire while driving to our site which caused us to stay longer to get the tire fixed. 

Would love to be able to stay here, but it is way too expensive for us without the Passport America discount."
5,5,"Great resort, Jan at the desk was super helpful. Great dog areas. Lots to do. We have booked for next year."
5,5,"Disclaimer: the views expressed here are those of a twenty something girl obsessed with her far off retirement who, despite her wildest dreams, does not live in an awesome retirement resort community, only visits them from time to time on work related trips.  

This place rocks.  Seriously. I've visited a few retirement communities in my day, and this one takes the cake.
The entrance is typical and unassuming, but tiddy.  What's waiting on the other side of the stucco guard shack (safety: check) is a real treat.
The streets and sidewalks are clean, the mobile homes are adorable and proudly display placques in each owner's taste (wether it be Steelers colors and a wood carving) listing their name and where they are from, nice touch. The tiny lawns are all well manicured, there's a nice Pleasantville feeling to it all.
It's all very lovely, but the club house is what it's all about. There's a nice fitness center, a billards room, a pool and a huge spa, with a poolside bar.  What?! That's right, a poolside bar! The bartender was clad in a colorful Hawaiian shirt, very Margaritaville, no wonder the golf carts were lined up and the bike racks full!
Well, what if your hobbies include more than drinking? That's your choice I suppose, so while I'm chillin' with the 'it's five o'clock somewhere' crowd you can mosey on over to guest services where they will be happy to provide you with an activities calendar.  Better pull out your readers, they had to use smaller font to make room for all the awesome stuff they have planned!
Everyday has at least 15 different games set up! Bocce ball! Yup! Pickle ball and tennis? Uh, yeah! Every card game I've ever heard of and several I haven't? You've got it!  Not to mention the special events and performances. How about a craft fair? Or maybe check out the comedic stylings of ""world famous"" Jimmy Keyes! I don't know who Jimmy Keyes is, but he's wearing a crazy coat in the promotional banner, so you know it'll be a good time.
The second I find a single retiree with a sweet rig I'm ditching my husband for the life I was meant for: retirement.  You'll find the two of us enjoying the live band at the pool, margaritas in hand, in one of the many comfy cabanas!"
5,5,We love VVV. This is our second winter in this park! It's the best! Very friendly people and more activities than we can do. But we find when we do come to an activity we are welcomed and encouraged. I am on the bowling league and had a blast. We walk almost every day stopping in at the gym to do some strength training as well. When we have time we go to the free afternoon concerts and you can have dinner in the cafe there as well! Overall we can say enough about this wonderful park. We are definitely coming back!!
5,5,"Went to Flagstaff last week, had an awesome time in the RV we rented from Messner RV. They are an honest reputable business.  We were in RV for 9 days, and they always answered when we would call asking silly questions.  Service like this is why they have been in business for over 20 years. We will definitely be back."
5,5,"Had a great week in the RV we rented, forgot how to use slide out at beginning of trip. When I called, they answered right away and got me going again. I take a trip once a year and I always use Messner RV Rentals."
4,5,"Their mobile service is amazing, broke down anywhere in the area, call them for a mobile mechanic for your RV or Semi, they can probably get your moving without a tow bill. Once your going you can either go to their shop for further repairs or not. 

Their RV service is awesome, Good clean pull through bays, in and out fast, you can stay at their yard if you need too. Pizza will deliver to their yard, Wal-Mart close by. WiFi, Washer and Dryer you can use. 50 amp service, dump station. But honestly they will usually have you in and out in one day."
4,4,Had our rv repaired. Took less time than stated. Yeah!  Back on the road again. Great price. Clean coach when picked up. Easy to get to. Owner and mechanics were great
4,5,"Some New Management,  new location with fenced in yard.  24hr on site security.  Large clean buildings to work in. In & out fast."
4,2,"We paid for inspection of a truck that we were purchasing.  Upon getting the truck, we found many more issues than actually revealed to us.  Not a good way to do business and we ended purchasing the truck and taking it elsewhere for the repairs.  It was too late...we purchased the truck and then received a list a mile long of repairs that needed to be done.  No honesty and a surprise."
2,1,"After you purchase an RV, they want nothing to do with you.  So disappointing.  I noticed this Camping World had very poor reviews so I should have gone elsewhere.  Still don't have title work after six months."
2,4,Didn't have what I needed but neither did the other five RV stores have what I needed. The sales person was very helpful and he too could not believe they no longer stocked the light I needed . We did talk about updating my rv's lighting system to LED lights which I did.
2,1,Rudest most unhelpful staff every. Walked out of the store and will buy online from their competitor.
2,4,"Trent and Brian took great care of us overall. If you can remember to hate the game, not the player, then they are amazing! The employees are all very nice and personable, just keep in mind that the Mesa location does use old school sales tactics, every single one in the book... So if you can go in prepared to 'handle' all of that, then you can do well. Also be prepared to comparison shop- it may be the only way you will have any leverage. We still overpaid for a new camper in the end (especially after the finance and warranty dept got a hold of us), and I am going to have to personally own that failure to stick with my guns- my fault really, they are just doing their jobs and I can admit to getting outplayed. (grrr) ;-) Our orientation went pretty smoothly and we really liked Danny, our tech. We do have a couple items that need to be addressed, and hope that process goes smoothly- will update this review with our post purchase service experience. Meanwhile, we are celebrating the acquisition of our very first travel trailer and plan to squeeze every penny of enjoyment (lots and lots of pennies) out of it that we can! Thank you Camping World of Mesa!"
2,1,"Absolutely the very worst repair experience ever.  A simple one day awning fabric replacement has stretched to 4 weeks.  Never once have they kept a commitment and there is always a new ""reason"".  Now they have pulled my unit from the repair bay as they were finishing it to make room for a customer who purchased a new unit.  This place is at best spastic.  I'll never go back once I retrieve my RV.  To bad there is not a negative star scale. It would be a negative 10."
2,1,"Traded in our 5th wheel in May 2016 for a 30 ft travel trailer, they had some things to do to it so in July I finally took position of it.  Took it out one time for 2 days came back with a list of things that should have been taken care of before delivery.  It is now a month later that they have had it and still no RV.  Atl all cost do no have your RV serviced here, they are more disorganized than any place could possibly get.  Tried to get them to take the RV back as I lost all desire to be paying for something that has been sitting on their lot except for 3 weeks since I bought it.  Oh no once you buy it your screwed ( and you won't get kissed)."
2,4,"Thank you for stocking so many large items!! makes things very easy when i need a AC unit, furnace, 3 way refrigerator, ceiling fans with remotes, central computer unit for monitoring tank levels, RV toilet, 45 amp power converter, jacks and a 3"" 10,000lbs towing ball today"
2,1,"Camping World SUCKS!  I will never PURCHASE an RV or anything else for that matter from them.  We have had nothing but broken promises.  We took our 5th wheel in for it's yearly inspection and were told there was a recall on it.  We told them we had a trip in 3 weeks.   No Problem we will put a rush on it.  Yea right we've heard that before.  Today is Monday we leave on Thursday and have been calling them daily for (friday, sat, sun, mon) and can't get anyone to help us (always the case with them, never answer the phone).  I don't know how they stay in business.  We had a terrible time when we purchased our RV they lost the keys and it took them 3 months and us yelling daily at them to finally get them to us.  Don't waste your time!!!  Don't go here!!!"
2,1,"We will never again come here for service or purchases. We had a shredded tire and damaged rim and they refused to help. My first experience was when we wanted to have our camper towed there so we could order a new rim /tire - they said no because they didn't have room for us. Then after we were able to pull the rim off and they still refused to help with a spare didn't care that our camper was stranded - we even offered a $200 deposit- nope.  And to order a new rim a tire would have just taken too long and would have been ""too expensive to overnight"" to us.
We were thinking of upgrading our camper and buying from them but now we will be going somewhere else that actually treats you as a human being and not a walking inconvenience to them."
2,2,"We starting FULL TIMING almost 28 years ago  (NOT A MISPRINT).  From the get go we used this facility in Mesa for all our rv service requirements  The old one, not the new facility that just opened in 2014.  The first ten years or so they were on the money and repairs were made in an orderly fashion. Then about 12 years ago things started to go south real fast.  Their labor rate went thru the roof and then some !  Last time I was there it was over $120,00 per hour.  To make matters worst they started making a lot of mistakes and then arguing about correcting them.

 For example,  I had them clean and grease the wheel bearings on all 4 wheels. Two days later we arrived in Mexico only to discover one rim was covered with axle grease. On inspection we discovered they had not replaced the cotter pin on that wheel.  That could have been a disaster !  Another time they handed me a print out for my service requirements for the sum of  $625.00, then at the end of the day handed me a bill for over $1300.00.  THEY had made a mistake and I had to pay since the bill for the larger amount was correct.  Still, talk about sticker shock !!  Another time we ordered a replacement fabric for the awning THEY had installed. Three times we arrived to have the new fabric installed  but each time when it was unrolled on the shop floor we found it was the wrong fabric or wrong length.  True, their supplier had shipped the wrong item, but don't they check, especially after 2 errors ?   The last time I was there I had called from Mexico to get a replacement tire that had blown near the border. We arrived a day later and they installed the new tire.  Several weeks later I discovered the tire was the correct brand but the WRONG size. True, I should have checked, but aren't they the TECHNICANS ?  Once we had them re-seal the edges of our rubber roof ($435.00) but got into a heck of an argument when I insisted on going up on the roof to inspect their work before paying the bill. 

This company has obviously gotten so big they have lost sight of their original mission.  They talk a good story on the phone, epically the people in the main office back east, but it's all TALK ! 

Another thing that several others have mentioned.  For a long time I sensed an attitude that I was lucky THEY were willing to work on my rig and boy, don't walk into the bay to check on things !!  In the beginning they had a nice small lounge area where you could get a free cup of coffee in the morning.  Guess what, NO MORE COFFEE.  OK, so now I'm picking on them, but hey, if you can charge more than the local chevy dealer for labor, then you can take a few on the chin.  

One last thing, and here I'm going to try to sneak one past yelp. If you want honest and fair repairs done correctly with no fuss made to your coach or auto then check my other reviews. Take one minute and you'll figure it out.
ADIOS CAMPING WORLD"
2,1,"Horrible experience. Sales manager yelling and screaming at my parents when they realized they couldnt buy the more expensive rv. Dont know why my parents still bought a used rv from them that took them over 40 days to fix when they paid for it in full. Then when they get it home the slide hydraulic resevoir is leaking. Camping world was worthless it was as if my parents bought a private party rv and threw in 10k extra and then paid tax on top of it. Service dept is independant of cw so im not sure what cw i s other than an overpriced middle man. I would stay away from this place. I did contact corporate but have yet to see any action or compensation for dragging their feet on the suspension repair which btw cw tried to say all rvs have ecessive steering wheel play. This place is a scam, everyone should be aware and avoid them."
2,1,"I'd give zero stars if possible!!!! this is the most non customer service place we've ever experienced!!! instead of providing care to their customers, they want to stare, laugh, and whisper!!!! never will we go again, or recommend them to family/friends!!!"
2,1,I'd appreciate it if Camping World staff would refrain from sending me Yelp Comments asking me to remove my review from April 2013. I will not be removing my review.
2,1,"Went in to look at buying a tt. First time in the young sales guy ask us first if we were planning to buy, when we said we were just starting our search he pointed toward the direction of where the tt were and walked away. Second time the sales guy was ok but told us our current trailer was worth $4k trade in and when we told him we would sell it privately he said it wasnt worth more than 6500$. We sold it for full list price, $8900. We found a trailer we liked but they would not meet us where we wanted to be. His response was dont let a few thousand dollars keep you from buying the trailer. He let us know that they had sold 6 or 7 trailers that day so apparently they were not going to be flexible. I called the Fresno camping world and the sales guy there was garbage. No customer service. I told him which trailer I was interested in and that I wanted to be at about 150$/month. He ran my credit and called me back later and said because my credit was not great he could do it for $300/month. I secured financing elsewhere with my 740 credit score and called them back to tell them I was paying cash. He never bothered to call me back. 

Regarding the service at this Mesa location, its honestly pretty bad especially at the parts department. Everyone looks unhappy and just not willing to provide a basic level of customer service. What the heck is wrong with these people!!? It was a blessing  that this deal did not work out because it allowed us more time to search and rule out the aluminum sided trailer to go with the fiberglass. Several weeks later we ended up buying a 2015 Dutchmen Aerolite 282BHS for 8k less than the original 2015 Starcraft 27BHS that we looked at. Plus the Starcraft trailers they were selling there appeared to be all broken into at some point because the window frames had vertical cuts thru them and were glued back together. In order to replace a broken window the frames need to be cut to slide out the old window and put the new one back in. I know because it happened to me. I asked the sales guy about why the manufacturer would sell units that looked like this and he shrugged it off and said he didnt know. The sales team and sales manager really dont  care. Once you sign the contract, good luck! Do not buy a tt from them!"
2,1,Picked up my rv from them on Friday.  They left the fridge/freezer off with the doors closed AFTER I had opened them.  Mildew everywhere!  They left it dirty inside and out and cut corners everywhere.  Example: replaced a compartment lock but didn't order a matching lock mechanism so now I have a key just for that compartment.  Really unimpressed.  The staff is friendly but that doesn't make up for their incompetence.  Avoid this place if you can!
2,2,"My fiancé and I have been looking to trade in our old travel trailer and purchase something more up to date.  I've been looking at the Camping World website and have been extremely disappointed.  They refuse to give vital information about trailers/RVs they're selling.  I mean, how hard is it to tell the length of the trailer without having to give all of your information and have a salesperson call?  How can anyone expect to find an RV/trailer dealer in this town? blech..."
2,1,"This review is for the service dept.  We are traveling from CA and needed an oil change for the generator.  Made an appointment for 9:00am and slept in the parking lot to make sure we were not late.  At 10:30am our rig was still sitting outside the bay, waiting for service.  I asked when they were going to get to it and was told ""they are working on it right now"", which was not true because it was still parked out front.  When I pointed this out, someone came around and picked it up immediately for service.  I guess I should have prompted them to get started sooner...i t is 11:30am and we are still waiting...this our last day in town to spend with family and I'm in the Camping World parking lot for half the darn day.   There are a ton of RV dealers on this same street; you might want to try one of them instead of this location for service.  Now I see why their average rating on Google is 1 star."
2,1,"When we purchased or RV we paid extra for their Elite member status (extra 3 years) we were told how great it was and that we would get #1,000 free campaign through Coast to Coast.  Well, we just tried to access it and this is the email I received:

The benefit you are referring to is no longer a benefit of Elite Good Sam Club members.
This benefit was on available for members who purchased in 2013.  The benefit was deemed to be of little benefit to Elite members and was discontinued in 2013.

Just another LIE"
2,1,Do not waste your time. Their sales team sucks and so does their service. I could go on forever but  i think what I already said is enough.
2,1,"Avoid at all costs, terrible service. Walked into the parts and services and not even a hello was said for 15 minutes even though people were sitting doing data input, walking through etc Talked to the manager and got excuses of being short people. It costs nothing to have your employees say hello or that they will be with you in a few minutes."
2,1,"Camping world will no longer be receiving any business from us. We needed their help in a desperate way with a spare tire as our camper was stranded and they did not care, did not help or offer any help . We even offered a couple hundred dollars as a deposit and we were still refused any help. I wanted to have our camper towed there to order a new rim/tire and were even refused that.  
We were also thinking of upgrading our camper with them but not now- will be going elsewhere.  We won't even buy a trash can from them at this point. Please take your business to a shop where they actually care about you as person."
2,1,"We purchased a 2014 travel trailer from Camping World Mesa in July of this year under the promise that they would switch out the couch as it was to short for my son to sleep on. It took 3 months for them to locate a couch after repeatedly calling them with no calls backs and broken promises. We brought the coach in finally about the first week in October to get the knew couch as well as have some warranty work done that was originally promised to be completed before we even picked the trailer up. We have yet to receive the coach back completed. I have yet to use my travel trailer as it has been tied up for the last 5 to 6 months. Oh sure they have told me I could come get it if I want to use it but all it does it cost me money to haul it back and forth and if I don't leave it there they will ""forget"" it needs work done. How can a 2014 travel trailer need so much work done is beyond me. I will never buy another camper from them again."
2,1,"Yeah... I beg you do not trust your trailer to these people.  They have had mine for 5 months and they literally can't keep track of their lies.  For the record I bought this trailer brand new from them and they now have had it ""in repair""for longer than I have had it available to use.

Don't come here.  Run away.  Flee."
2,1,"Just got home form camping world! Wow what a joke. Back about 5 weeks ago we were given a $20 gift coupon form the sales department as a good will jester for 8 trips down to the store to resolve a problem. 
Ok now to give them another try we went into the store an bought a set of sheets. $33 after the $20 coupon for merchandise. Now comes the fun part. The sheets were such poor quality and smaller than the dimensions posted on the package. We returned them for a refund. Was going to buy $20 in rubber seal conditioner in exchange for the $20 dollar coupon. Was told that they could not do that because the coupon was already used for the sheets that I just returned. After about 10 min. of arguing and trying to explain that I was just going to exchange the $20 toward the sheets for the seal conditioner. They told me that there system could not do that. Finally got the $33 back for the sheets. And I got nothing for the $20 coupon for the crappy service. Why would any body do business with this company. NEVER AGAIN!"
2,1,"If you have any self respect don't spend a dime here.  Worst customer service on the planet.  I literally can't keep track of the amount of times they have bold faced lied to me about our trailer.

Don't use their service department, don't buy a trailer, don't buy from the retail shop.  Go anywhere else and you will be happier."
2,1,"The retail section is average, but the parts counter experience sucked!  I spoke with Jim, who could not understand that if he gave me the part number for an item they had on hand, that I could ""Google"" it and find a picture to tell if it would work for me.  I tried several ways to explain it to him, which only frustrated him.  So he told me I needed to talk to a different department, and and parked me on hold.  After 5 minutes of waiting I hung up.  Can't wait to see him in person....."
2,1,"Sunday we went to camping world in  Mesa, AZ to look for a toy hauler. We were greeted by Ryan who was great and took the time to show us around the lot. We then came across a used 2006 toy hauler. He told us they had it sold but the deal fell through. The people were going to try and get private financing the sales manger then told Ryan there was a very little chance these people would qualify. Never were we told the party had a deposit down on the trailer. We were under the impression the trailer was available.

 Fast forward almost 3 hours where we come to a agreement on price. We ask Ryan so dose this mean the trailer is ours if we qualify? Ryan says yes! Not once were we told that this trailer might be sold to another party or that we were a back up deal or that the other party even had a deposit down. This VERY Important information was NEVER relayed to us. We were under the impression that the trailer would be ours if we qualified. If we would have know this we would have never authorized Camping World to run our credit or give them a down payment.  We would have simple requested  to let us know if the deal goes through or not and we will talk then.

  Here we are Wednesday afternoon and  we are just now finding out about the situation from Ryan. We spoke with Sales Manger Kent Wheeler to express our disappointment and how i feel we were taken advantage of in this situation and how badly this makes not only them but the company look by not being upfront with the all the details and misleading us about the current deal. We spoke with Ryan a few times after regarding the situation. We asked for a copy of any and all paper work we signed and was told that they can not scan it to email it to us and that we would have to come down for the paperwork. 

When speaking with Ryan about the situation we went around in circle about what had happened. I also got Ryan to tell me that maybe in the mix of his excitement  for the deal he did not explain to us clearly about the situation and took blame for that. He then proceeded to tell us that he was being talked to by his mangers about the situation and what he should have done differently. At the end of the day we still feel completely used and heartbroken over the experience with Camping World in Mesa, AZ and how they do business.  We can only imagine how many other people have been taken advantage of at the company. Being up front and honest and having good work ethics will go along way!!! We will not be doing business with them as we are completely devastated over the situation. I would like an apology from the Corporate Office and we would also like for them to recall the credit pull as we were given misleading information and would have NEVER  authorized for them to pull credit if we would have know the full information  that was withheld from us."
2,1,CAMPING WORLD SUCKS. Their CEO doesn't want Trump supporters buying from them. Stay away!
2,1,I will make the same offer on Yelp I made to Camping World.  I bought the TT in May 2016 it is now Sept 2016 and I have used the RV one weekend.  I will be glad to let them buy the RV back for what i paid for it minus $1000.  I paid for special treatment on the paint and had a 2 nd AC installed.  Now in my book that is a hell of a business deal and I will not say another negative thing about Camping World.
2,1,Be careful. They make appointments for service and your RV doesn't go into the shop for weeks. They don't return calls and most of the time they don't answer phones.
2,1,"Found it difficult to communicate
They all seem to be in a ZONE

Didn't seem to know there products"
2,5,"Well, I guess I got lucky today. Looking at the other review and what I went through at  Camping World Avondale makes me believe Keith is a rare gem of a guy and prayer does work.

48 hours to Country Thunder, a like-new RV, total incompetence from Avondale Camping World, and I find a service foreman that not only figured out why my AC wouldn't work, but took the time to walk me through and finish what wasn't completed in Avondale. Keith at Mesa CW  really saved my bacon.

It is so sad to see the horrible review on both these Camping World sites. CW, what is going on? We spend thousands on the vehicles and yet the service (except for Keith) is horrific."
2,1,"I think this might be the worst experience we have ever had with a business.  We dropped off our 4 horse trailer with live in quarters at camping world for maintenance and to have the generator fixed.  After it being there for a week and a half and not hearing from them, we give them a call.  We get some big story about how they were waiting for our approval on repairs but after pushing more, we were told that the person handling it quit.  So after getting that handled and about another two weeks, we are told it is done.  After getting it home, we find out that we were charged over 3K and the trailer has more damage than when brought in.  The generator still doesn't work, the overhead recessed lighting is hanging , the blinds that were suppose to be restrung are just gone, the tv is missing and the list is just to long.  At this point, we are leaving in a few days for a two week barrel race excursion and can't take it back in.  We are told to bring it back in when we get back and it will all be taken care of.  We get back and bring it in immediately.  Well almost two weeks later and daily phone calls to them and we are finally told that basically they couldn't fix anything and to come get the trailer.  We are just bewildered that this place is still in business"
2,1,"What a rip off these people are i took my coach in there on the 15th on november for generator service and for them to check entrance door air leak and why the furnace wasn't getting and gas, when i dropped it off they said they would be done with it the 23rd of november not to call them e-mail them for which i did and the only email response i got was the water valve was on order and wouldn't be in for another week ? I emailed back said there was nothing wrong with any water valves it my coach was in for the heater and gen service with no response back till i called the main manager then i told them im leaving december 7th on a trip and they said it wouldn't be finished so i went and took possession of my coach on the 2nd at a cost of $420 for a service on the generator and for them to tell me what i told them about my darn heater i will never take nor will i ever recommend them to anyone for repairs"
2,5,"Need to rent an RV? This is the place to go!  I've rented from other places in the past, but NEVER have I been treated so respectfully, so helpfully, so... enjoyably!  On top of that Camper's World's weekly rates were the best in town.  This was the first step to a fantastic vacation."
2,5,"Always great service, join Presidents Club for great deals, its hard to not be happy when you are getting ready to go CAMPING!!!"
2,1,"Wow, This place was unbelievable - not a single person could answer a question about my 2014 Forest River Forester 3171 ds and they are a authorized dealership for this company. The help here was unknowledgeable and not very nice at all. If possible I would stay far away from this place.  I was going to spend a lot of money here to stock up my newly purchase RV. I will wait until I find another camping world or RV store. Oh, just a side note, they probably don't care about any of their customers- you can see by their reviews.  -10 STAR!!!"
2,1,"I wish I could give the Service dept. no stars! Awful service department.  Here is what happened. We have a 2004  21 foot 4 winds trailer costing $7200 when we bought it used 3 years ago. Good shape but I broke gray water cable (I pushed it in to hard) Took in with appointment on 1-25,2016. Nate Janusz was my Service Adviser and told me labor hour rate is $129.but could do the work for $100 which I still thought was high (just west of them,their rate is $80 I found out later) Camping World had a Special on service on water heater,A/C,propane so since I haven't had that ever done I said to do that too. Nate called for me to come pick up trailer after two weeks, I waited 30-40 minutes until I finally went in golf card and found trailer as they didn't know where it was parked.Also I was overcharged,bill was to $557. I wasn't happy and I looked over bill and found that the ""service special price was not correct and charged $129 instead of quoted price of $100.So I paid $477.06 -$80 They also checked my Heater and found a break in wire but I decided not to get that fixed as it would cost another $1000.When I looked in trailer before I left I found that the thermostat was hanging from the wall and propane tank cover wasn't fixed(two small rivets replaced) so I had the guy who drove me around in golf cart to find my  trailer and some guy in shop come out to fix it which took  another 10 minutes. Nate didn't bother to come out to check on work.On 2-4 after camping I had to return to camping World as gray water handle won't pull out(the thing they just fixed,now they said I need a new valve so replaced that for $156.45   Had to return on 3-3 as the hot water valve was leaking(never did before service) Not happy so talked to Service Manager, Rick Williams and he said he would mail me a cw gift card for $50 for the problems I had with being over charged and poor service .Never got gift card  and then they said my gray water valve was bad and hot water heater valve need to be replaced. Which I said that should have been discovered on the service in January. This time when I went to pick up Trailer they where still working on it but Nate called me and told me it was ready. Had to wait again and I had to leave without the bill as I had another appointment so they e-mailed me the bill for $365.28 I couldn't believe the poor service by both Nate and Rick. I e-mailed back about never receiving GC and when I do receive it I will pay them. Got back a nasty e-mail fro Rick Williams pursuing legal rights if not paid and no other issues like GC will be discussed until paid. So I put a $315.28 check in mail minus $50 and he said that will be accepted.So I paid a total of $948.79 and really only got service on 3 appliances, new gray and hot water valves($12.99,$39.25),new gray water cable($29.99),new 7 way plug for brakes($7.49)   I will never go for Service there again and will tell other RV'ers the experience I had and encourage then to go else where."
2,1,"I purchased a 2018 Dutchman Atlas,  I had some damage from another trailer and took it back to the dealer. It was approximately 7 weeks for repair that supposedly with Good Sam, I should have had back in 3 at the longest. If you love being sent to voice mail when you wish to speak to someone.... This is the place.
  I picked my trailer up and got it home, 35 miles, opened it up went in, closet door laying on the floor.... The screws holding it on we're no longer them 1/4 inch..... Very shoddy for a $34,000.00 trailer. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN SALES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! My salesman has quit so now I get the voicemail run-around.... The only way I have found any satisfaction is haul my ass back down to Mesa and speak to someone personally, can't hide and ignore you if you are there. Think twice, and do a through and through inspection before you buy!!!!"
2,1,"Horrible. I had heard stories about Camping World but thought I'd give them a try. 
I was trading up from a Class C to a Class A. Had a deal $15k difference. We all agreed. Signed the paperwork. BAM!
In walks the sales manager Brain who informs me they made a mistake and now it will be $30K. 
Tried to give me reasons but I'm not buying any of them. 
Walked out. 
DO NOT buy here."
2,1,Took my 1997 Fleetwood Discovery in for generator service and to have the furnace worked on Boe Cottom told me no problem we'll have it done for ya by the 23rd of november now its the 30 th of November he told me best way to contact him was e-mail ive e-mailed him several times only response I received was my 4 way water valve wont be in for another week? The furnace dos not have a water valve cant get any answers from them im going tomorrow and getting it i hope its not all disassembled i will never take anything back to them first experience with camping work not good at all wish i had red the reviews on here before i took it to them and were leaving dec 7th with it
2,1,"ALWAYS have problems with the service dept.  NEVER going there again!  Wanted to buy a Blue-Ox weight distribution system ($1000 approx)  Spoke with James at store, left to look at our trailer info at home him saying he would be at store for 2 1/2 more hours.  Called back 20 minutes later, MUCH time on hold, and  he was ""gone for the day"".  Spoke with Justin, he was supposed to see if actually was one in stock and see what appt times were available.  When he called back said did have one but unable to contact the person making service appts, looked like either early am or afternoon, and he promised to call us back.   He never called back to say which appt time, and next day (day before supposed appt) we did several calls trying to find out what was going on, was on hold long periods of time, re-routed back to operator, another number tried with no answer, and finally operator said only way was for us to leave a voice message---by that time we left a voice message saying to cancel the purchase entirely and cancel any appt. times they might have made for us but forgot to tell us.  We'll buy this product from a service dept that actually gives SERVICE to customers."
2,1,"I can't even give this company 1 star!
  I am a single woman, first time motorhome buyer, and to say this has been a nightmare is an understatement!
  It took me 2 years of research and planning to decide which motorhome I wanted. I decided I wanted a Forest River, Mercedes 24'.
  The sales manager found the exact unit I wanted in Colorado. I purchased and paid for it at the  Mesa Camping World, and because it was my 60th birthday present, to me from me, I flew myself and 2 girlfriends to pick it up and celebrate with a vacation. 
  We took a taxi from the airport to the Camping World in  the Denver area. We were there waiting in the waiting room for so long that we actually ordered pizza delivered there. By the time I was finally called back to see my new home, it was getting close to closing. The gal who delivered it to us was anxious to get home to her daughter, she did not have much time to show it to us, but in that short period of time, we noticed things like a bubbled headliner, bubbled veneer on the cabinets, small holes in the flooring, and doors that didn't close properly. Figuring it to be brand new, we went ahead and took it, those things should be under warranty, right?
 Well, the first night we stayed at a friend's house in Denver, and could not get the hot water heater to work. Cold showers. So getting on to our trip the next day. As we are driving down the highway, more than once the door flies open, figuring that we just didn't close it hard enough, it did it again. We had to lock it to keep it from flying open, then it was very difficult to get it open and the wind blew loudly through it from day one. 
  As we are down the road, a ""new"" motorhome mind you, my girlfriend goes into the bathroom and yells that the toilet was backing up! On receiving the unit I noticed that the toilet seat was dirty underneath. We had barely used it! Taking red Solo cups, we dipped urine and feces out of the toilet! It was disgusting! So on to find a dump, I pay to dump my ""brand new home"" and guess what? I pull the black water tank valve, and it is totally NOT connected! No way to dump it! 
  I call Camping World in Mesa, they tell me to drive to a small town in the Rockies and they will send a technician. We spend the night in a town we had no plans on staying in, in hopes of getting help. No hot water, full of poop, and we went out to eat, came back to sleep, turn on the furnace, it was cold, and about an hour after we fall asleep, we are awakened by the smoke detector screaming at us! I grabbed my Yorkie, gave her to my friends and as they got out of the smoke, it was filled with it, coughing, I was trying to get the furnace shut down.
  The technician came the next day, had to cut my pipes apart, put in an aftermarket pipe, in my ""new"" Mercedes, he couldn't figure out how to repair the hot water, so we used cold water, he said that they should have burned the oil off in the prep, but instead they delivered it to us as if it had been lived in for some time. We started noticing things like the table had wear spots where you could tell that people had eaten repeatedly there. 
  Again, call the manager, he tells us to go to a Walmart, leave everything open, turn on the furnace, go shop for a couple of hours, and let it burn off. We did that, hoping that no one would break in, came back out about 2 hours later, and it had completely shut down, no luck. The manager even told me to open where the hot water heater was a tap on it with a hammer, $100,000 motorhome!
  We figured our trip was obviously ruined, so we decided to head home.
  Now I and my friends are very experienced drivers, I have hauled loads of horses and a living quarters trailer up and down the Salt River Canyon many times. And I have had a Mercedes, and very familiar with the transmission.  As we headed down Wolf Creek Pass, the unit would not gear down no matter how hard I, or my other 2 friends tried, and thank goodness I am experienced, I would have totally lost my brakes if I wasn't! I did find a pull off I was able to steer into, opened the doors and smelled rubber very badly. There was no phone service there, so I white knuckled it the rest of the way down. This thing was a nightmare!
  We got home, it totally ruined our trip, and I took it in. It as a VERY long time in service, I have hardly ever had time to use it."
2,5,Had a minor issue after purchasing regarding scheduling repairs - turned out to be a communication issue with the team quickly resolved. They have a good management team that is responsive to customer needs. The best way to evaluate any company is how they respond when there are minor issues - versus when things go perfect.
2,1,"they were very rude to me
would  not be very flexible or bend
after a two day run with them.
   
sales person sergio   was rude as well.
i  wasted time  and   made a great almost full price offer."
2,1,"I highly recommend not buying a RV at Camping World. I have my new Keystone passport trailer in for service. I dropped it off August 14 and 44 days later it's finally ready for me to pick up. I was told that I was going to get a brand new floor put in because of a bubble issue( CW fixed a previous bubble) under the linoleum and then a few days later I was told I would not get a new floor after I had gone down,picked out materials from a local flooring company. They do not believe in service after the sale, just look at their ratings. Since my trailer has been sitting for such a long time in a dirt lot, I asked  my Service Advisor Robert Dealy,  if he could get it washed before I pick it up tomorrow and his comment was unfortunately no. That's ridiculous and  horrible customer service."
2,1,"Horrible service at camping world! We took our brand new RV into the shop for some maintenance. They had it for 65 days and then didn't fix everything that was supposed to be fixed. Left it completely dirty and stains in the drapery and hardwood floors! The manager, Rick Williams, came out and said yeah! Not our apologies, just a nod and yeah!  No interest in helping us, we now have to go to La Mesa RV to get the remainder fixed. Disappointing, I can see why their scores are so bad!"
2,5,"Went in today to ask a few questions about a used RV i'd just purchased. I've never owned an RV before and Ray in parts made me feel comfortable, answered my questions and went out of his way to be helpful. I live several cities away, but will be back because of Ray. Thanks again!!!"
2,5,We love Camping World it has all of your camping needs and more. The staff is very friendly and helpful  so if you're looking for nice camping supplies or a trailer then I suggest Camping World in Mesa.
2,1,"I had an Insta-Brake installed on my new car & 12 days later I lost my brakes completely. I was near home and used my emergency brake to make it the last 2 blocks. I had the car transported to the auto dealer & paid $170.66 for the repair. The dealer said [wrote] that the loss of braking was from an ""after market fitting"" installed with the Insta-Brake. I called Camping World Mesa and got no satisfaction. I wrote Camping World Mesa & Camping World Headquarters in Kentucky asking for reimbursement of my $170.66 and got NO RESPONSE.
This could have ended much different if I'd been traveling on the interstate or approaching a stop.
Camping World Mesa has a very POOR attitude and I will NOT be returning soon."
2,1,"I would give no stars, had that been an option! Spent LOTS of money here on a new motorhome. Once it came time for service and ordering of warranty parts and repair it became a problem. It's very hard to get calls returned! Once they sell you something they could careless about your business. Lesson learned and I will go elsewhere next time and encourage anyone else to do the same!"
2,5,"the best stocked camping world, but even better was all of the friendy attentive staff.

thank you"
2,2,"I am a FIRST TIME BUYER of a Motorhome/RV and the Sales person was great. Absolutely wonderful.  Even when we bought we received our $50 gift card and the cashier was great trying to find us on the computer MORE Discounts then already listed.  

The internal side is horrible. From the time I chose my RV and going thru MY OWN BANK was like a turn off for them.  I have USAA.  USAA said they would have a check to them in 1 day for the RV and the Manager saying ""well we can't guarantee it without a Deposit"" even through I said the check will be there tomorrow and email from the Bank showing it.  I said ""oh well if it isn't"".   Almost too pushy.   

I have had my Motorhome for MORE THAN 30 days and have yet to receive any DMV paperwork and my paper plates are expired so No road trips for me which I did have one planned.  Plus I am receiving letters from my bank on the Title and paperwork they haven't received.  THANKS CAMPING WORLD..  I have emailed and called and left 3 messages with 3 different people and NO ONE calling me back. Finally on my 4th attempt i talked to a finance manager who said ""I'll walk it back and personally see what is happening.  I'll call you back"". 3hrs later NO call back and I had to call them back and left a message.  Also emailed returned saying ""I am with guests, I'll you in a hour"".   NO PHONE CALL BACK.  This isn't their first Rodeo.  

All i can say is AZ is the RV capital of the US.  Shop around.  Others would love to have your business.  STILL WAITING ON WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PLATES!!!!!!!   TO THE GM:  YOU NEED TO REALLY REVIEW YOUR QUALITY OF SERVICE AND AUDIT YOUR DEPARTMENTS.  TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR REVIEWS...."
2,1,"If I could give less stars, I would. RUN, DONT WALK TO ANY OTHER RV SERVICE CENTER. 
It all started when they wouldn't answer the phone (not even for the national call center). They would transfer to a phone that only had a VM but wouldn't return calls. Finally, after trying for 2 days we got an appointment. Kept trying CW because they are a dealer for our brand of RV. Once we got the RV in we had no communication with them for 4 weeks. Nobody called and told us anything. Let me just make clear our RV was in for minor service (oil change, hydrolic leak, and broken lock). Finally, after 6 weeks I had to use the RV. I told them at week 5 Id be in to pick it up in a week. Then the day before I picked it up I told them I'd be in the next day. I show up and surprise surprise it's not ready. So here I sit waiting and writing the review. This place is HORRIFIC!"
2,1,"Talking about buying an RV only.  They are ripoff artists. They charge extra for the brand name of the RV, charge for orientation and nickel and dime you.  Even a place like little dealer does not do that.  Buyer beware!  There are other places to buy an RV.  We eventually purchased in Prescott and had a much netter experience and selection with nothing added on except for tax, title, and license.  

Camping World wanted an extra $2500 because the trailer was a Starcraft which is also a low rated brand per RV Guide.  Stay away and spend your money elsewhere"
2,1,"Dont know why I come here either over priced or bad service. Was looking for a carry bag for a rv rug. Found it on their site. Called the store and was told they had 10 for the same price of 11.99. Drove 30 min to the store . Parts guy said 10 then asked a girl to show me where they were (you would think by the rv rugs) and she stated ""oh does it still say we have some, cause we dont it's a computer error"" . No apologies that I drove out . So first now I'll pay 8.95 shipping on am 11.99 item but your store will never stock them because no one is correcting your ""computer issue"" since your inventory look like it's there and not moving. Bad business and your loosing sales."
2,1,"Worst customer service ever. Scheduled to have Prodigy 2 brake controller install and was quoted one price after a full detailed description of what I wanted done. I have existing 6 prong plug and wanted to change it to 7 prong plug to pull my trailer. Got here on time and had to wait 45 minutes before finding out our customer rep was a no show and was transferred to a very rude; ""I am doing you a favor by doing this rep."" After talking to her the price jump to nearly double, but we were in a bind and needed to get it installed. Then one hour later and after sitting there for past 2.5 hours rep came back and told us it was going to take 7.5 hours at a rate of $125 per hour. So this brake control is going from $287 to $403 to now over $1100. I picked up the phone and called 2 different RV repair shops and both quoted me a worst case scenario of 3.5 to 4 hour labor. I would have gone to them but neither could get me in the same day as I was leaving on a trip after the install. I requested to speak to the service manager after getting no help from the female service rep, ""I'm too busy eating"".  I was able to settle on a price for over $700. So why am I still here you ask?  It's because I have travelled 2 hours to get here and am in a bind to make my vacation and need to tow a trailer. I thought I had scheduled everything in advance to avoid any issue, but was wrong. Thanks to them it's cost me nearly tripled and I am waiting to see if they will deliver by 5pm as promised. If there was a negative star. I would have given it to them. All this hassle for being a loyal member. I will not renew my membership or recommend them ever.   Moving to AAA plus RV and shopping at Amazon prime."
2,1,"If I could I would give a negative zero to Campers World.  I purchased a brand new travel trailer from Campers World four months ago and used it once. It has been back in the service center at  Campers World for the past two months for warranty work and ""waiting on parts"".  We received a call to pick it up that ""it is all ready"" and the warranty work was never done and the trailer is actually in worse shape than when we left it for repairs. Never, never, never buy from Campers World. Their service center is awful and will give you the run around for months to avoid fixing warranty work!!!!!"
2,1,"What a disappointment!  When we made the appointment, we stressed that we needed the rig in two weeks and were told there was no problem with the timeline.  Made an appointment and dropped our rig off  on a Wednesday for a 45 point check up and requesting the repair of a couple of things we knew needed attention.  We were told we'd have an estimate and report in two days.  Friday comes and goes and we hear no word.  Let them have Monday and then started calling on Tuesday morning and put into voice mail.  Called back at noon b/c we had no response and put into voice mail again.  Called at 3pm because we still hadn't heard and I was being shuttled back into a VM box.  Then I asked if the service writer was even there and was told, ""Oh yeah.  Now that you mention it, I think I heard she's out sick.""  So I asked for the service manager and was told that really wasn't possible and I really needed to wait for my service writer.  Will she be back tomorrow?  ""I don't know.  But I'll send her an email.  Sometimes she looks at those from home.""  I pushed back was given to another service writer who said she would talk to the service manager follow up for us.  Now we are to Wednesday and they have had it for week with nothing being done.  Called back on Wednesday to confirm they were actually looking at our rig and were told we would have a the results of the inspection by the end of day.  When they finally call us back they can't get parts for the dash air in time for us to take it on the scheduled trip -- but we are told we can use the roof air, which require the generator and that reduces our mileage to about 5mpg.  Fine. We are particularly happy to learn of their ""fix"" for the missing AC issue.   We get to Wednesday of the week  it was due and they aren't done; we can have it on Thursday.  When we get to the counter, our service writer is complaining to the customer in front of us about how Camping World is throwing her ""under the bus.""  Pick up our rig, drive about 15 miles to local audio shop to have our new sound system installed only to discover Camping World had disconnected our dash air and pulled the control panel through the DIN opening for the radio.  Audio people won't work on it until that connection is fixed so we had to drive back to Camping World where they had the nerve to tell us they might not be able to ""get to it today."" It's not the service writer's fault; they told her everything was fixed.  Turns out the young man who is the air conditioning service tech admits he didn't realize we were taking the rig; he had ordered a part and left it dismantled while he waited for it to be received.  Not once did he blame the situation on someone else.  He is the only one who apologized for the screw up, took responsibility and said it was a miscommunication and he should have followed up.  Very professional young man. He's the only reason they got a star; management can thank him for that.  And, the service manager NEVER did talk to us. The service manager did issue a $25 coupon to be used in the store. Way too little, way too late.  I don't know about other Camping World stores, but we are done with this one.  Typical RV service unfortunately -- taking in way too much work with no ability to manage the work -- over promising and severely under producing.  We are still in search of a descent service center if anyone has any ideas.  Guess what Camping World Service Manager:  If you would have just talked to us -- you not your staff -- apologized for everything from the beginning, offered to take care of us personally, you'd be looking at a very different review right now.  If reviews mean anything to Camping World, you might want to have a chat with these people followed by a customer service retraining session -- maybe it could be led by your A/C tech."
2,1,"I purchased a camper from this place a few months ago and I should have read the reviews before I purchased.  First, the sales rep did a good job of finding a good camper for me and was polite and professional.  Where it all started to go downhill was when we started signing paperwork.  This is where the evil roots of this company started to rear its ugly head.  Beware during the signing, they will use every angle possible to get another couple hundred (or several thousand) dollars out of you unless you call them on it.  I negotiated a 5 year full warranty into the price before signing only to find out they had essentially lied to me and said the warranty I wanted only covered very limited items that I didn't even care about anyway (fabric for instance). So during the signing they tried to sucker me into another warranty that would cost an additional 3,000 dollars.  I almost walked out at that point.  BTW, about a week later I purchased an identical 5 year warranty through the manufacturer (covers the big items you care about like fridge, A/C, hot water heater..etc which included labor & parts) at a fraction of the cost...something Camping World will never tell you.  Additionally, that warranty will work anywhere besides just Camping World which is a huuge bonus. Why?, because their service is atrocious and unprofessional whether you have a warranty or not.  Furthermore, their service and sales are two separate companies entirely who don't communicate with each other even though they work under the same roof and sit right next to each other.  I didn't know that until I had a problem shortly after I purchased and the people who sold me the camper seriously could have cared less and didn't want to have anything to do with me.  So I took my camper issues ""across the building"" to the ""other 3rd party service company"" (those who where the black shirts versus the blue) and their professionalism is horrific.  I couldn't believe how disorganized and flustered they were. They were overtly bad mouthing their co-workers and other customers.  At this point, I was ecstatic that I had my wits about me during the signing and chose to get my warranty elsewhere so when my standard 1 year warranty runs out, I can bid this place adieu, take my business elsewhere and never return again.  I hope this review helps!"
2,5,I took a relatively new 5th wheel to Camping World Avondale for some minor collision repair.  Follow through and communication was so good from Gary  that I have moved warranty service to Camping World as well.  Gary and Camping World Service stepped up and took care of all their commitments even though I didn't purchase the trailer from them.  Their service is a major improvement from the company where I purchased the unit during one of the RV shows.
2,5,"First, let me start off by saying that Tara Z is my wife. She left a negative review due to the frustration of dealing with Camping World prior to this review. 

We had some warranty work that needed to be taken care of on the new Springdale that Hal sold us. We love this camper but a few things never were right... Like the battery, the blinds coming down off the walls, the windows in the bedroom leaked, the ground wire post on the hot water heater some how broke, the kitchen faucet leaked, and several other issues we found while using the camper. Believe me, we dreaded taking it in because of our collective experience with the service department. We were introduced to Daryll, the assistant manager of service. Not only did he make sure all of the warranty items were taken care of, he also went above and beyond by taking care of the little things we hadn't seen. We even got a fresh battery for the smoke detector!

Paul, one of the service techs, has been awesome to work with. He did our initial walk through and answered all our questions with ease and expertise.

Alberto, another technician, is the one who worked on our RV. When we picked up the trailer from the warranty work we were able to meet him. One of the blinds was coming down and I asked how to remove the curtain hardware to access the top of the blinds. Daryl called Alberto over and asked if he could help us out. Alberto went above and beyond by removing it himself and demonstrating how to fix it if it falls in the future. Both Daryl and Alberto went above and beyond.

This experience and the level of communication has been really great. From Kim making sure I had access to my RV when needed to the one guy who I always forget his name at the service desk coordinating the initial drop off. 

Camping World, please let this experience be an example to everyone involved to show the success and level of performance you all are capable of.  THIS is how your customers will come back.  THIS is how you gain loyalty and build even employee competency. Celebrate your successes and learn from the failures. Well done guys."
2,5,"100K. Three months later, we still can't register the vehicle because:
1. Mileage was wrong. We had to go to the DMV to adjust to actual.
2. found out that they sold this without a smog check. Had to bring it back"
2,2,"I still have issues with this company, but not with the service people. Phillip and Darrell are great to deal with and just as frustrated with the system as anyone. The main problem is they take in too much work and make promises they can't keep. I spoke with a couple today that have been dealing with a leak issue on their travel trailer for two and a half years. They were told to pick it up today only to find it wasn't done when they arrived. Sadly that happens often. 
Again, I fault the system, not the people."
2,1,"Tom:  Keep working on your customer service issues.  90 days after your posting, there is ZERO improvement.  We waited in line over 30 minutes to receive zero assistance and a complete lack of effort to help resolve an issue.
You have your work cut out for you. Keep trying."
2,5,"We just picked up our brand-new fifth wheel from Camping World in Avondale. We have been working with Terry in sales over the phone for the last month on the purchase of our RV. He was very helpful and wonderful to work with. Corey the manager even called to make sure we were happy and gave us a great deal. We picked up our RV yesterday. Eddie in the service department helped us with our walk-through. He took his time and went through every thing on our RV, explaining exactly how to use it and answering all of our questions. A couple of things needed to be addressed and he took care of every single one of them. He was easy to work with, very knowledgeable and took care in fixing the bugs without going faster than necessary. This was our first RV purchase and we appreciated that CW took great care of us!"
2,1,Now thst the sale of the RV is done within a month there was no service if call th the service center they would not return ur call  n if u took ur coach  don't expect to get any better we took our coach in on Wednesday n was ot would be ready on Friday on Saturday when we went out to get our coach it was still sitting in the parking after words with the manager he then had the service manager come out and two and half hours later our fixed so thought there were fixing the steps a month later they didn't fix right and the manufacturer had to send us to a different repair shop and the whole step had to be replaced will never use Camping World for any kind of repair work there service people don't care about the customer
2,5,"I went to Camping World in Avondale today to have some work done on my travel trailer. Although I had been in their store, and they are generally very friendly,  I was surprised how friendly and accommodating the staff in the service department are. The service advisor that assisted me was Phillip Mayse and he took the time to closely listen to my issues and helped me resolve them. While listening to my issues he realized my travel trailer had another potential safety issue which he later had resolved by technician Derek  Wingate. Derek also was very helpful as he gave me advice as to what to watch for and how to resolve it. Being a relatively new RVer I really appreciated the help and advice. I will definitely return to Camping World and will definitely ask for Phillip."
2,1,"We bought a brand new Forest River from the location in Mesa and was pleased with the sales and service.  We  had it out for the third trip and during this trip noticed a few things that needed to be fixed.  The manager on duty at the Avondale location was not helpful.  He told us we couldnt leave it because there wasnt anybody in service to leave it with in case something was stolen.  Scary to think thats what his concern was.  We offered to lock it up and was still turned away.  
It isnt terribly convenient for us to get it there during their business hours due to where we store the trailer and where we work.  I would suggest taking your trailer somewhere else if you are looking for service.   I am also open to suggestions."
2,1,I bought my motorhome at Camping World of Avondale along with their extended warranty. I have had several small issues since then that were covered under warranty. I have never had anyone in the service department who could follow through. The service representative will look at your issues and tell you that they will call you when they have verified coverage with your insurance. Two weeks later I call them. No one can even see a case opened for me. Whenever I call I get an after hours message and maybe or maybe not someone will call you back. I have taken my business to State Trailer where they can do the same things for you as Camping World. They don't even make you leave your motorhome at their facility sitting in the sun for 3 months!
2,1,"If I could give this place a NO STARS, I would. I am so upset with the service department for poor, unfinished work and very rude attitude. I am actually still so very upset that I don't think it appropriate to say what I really want to say. I left with my RV service incomplete today and torn apart. I do not at this time recommend this place for anyone."
2,1,"My experience is so much like the others on here that it is scary.  First off, this is mainly directed at the service and parts dept.  We bought a new travel trailer and the sales experience wasn't too bad.  The facilities are nice and they have free coffee and popcorn--so that is good.  The shopping/store is nice as well.

Here we go:  The service and parts dept is so incredibly unorganized and poorly managed that it blew my mind.  We had several issues with our new travel trailer (I won't fault camping world for that) but bringing it in and leaving it with them has been an absolute nightmare.  Lost/missing parts, calls NEVER returned, no answered phones, clueless staff, etc. has been the absolute norm.  On more than one occasion they have said:  let me look into it I will call you back in a few minutes.......NO call the entire day or ever.  Seriously??  Who does this??

I am really upset that I may have to go back in the future unless I can find somebody to do warranty work on my trailer.  The thought of bringing it back makes me absolutely sick.  Right now I have nothing wrong with our trailer--so I am not some buyer who is disgruntled with his purchase.  I even waited a month or so to write a review just to cool off and make sure that I wasn't dreaming.

In my life I have never encountered an organization/business with such absolute lack of leadership/organization/efficient customer service.  Camping World:  if you have a corporate headquarters and happen to read this, you NEED to send your guys down and clean house.  All the managers and general manager need to GO  (Fire them immediately if you have any respect for your brand name)!  There is a reason that all of the other reviews on here are only 1 star.  I would LOVE to give this place a good review--especially since we live nearby, bought our trailer from them, and would love a local company to do business with.

I am considering driving across the valley to go to the other camping world--but just saw some questionable reviews on their store as well.  I will add the disclaimer that I have never visited another camping world store, so I don't know if this is the norm.  I hope not.

First YELP review ever.  Can't believe it had to be so bad."
2,1,"We took our RV to them for warranty work on 10/7/2016 and we were told that it would be about a month for the repair. 4 months later we got our camper back. Not everything was done ie: Roof work still had an unsealed hole(Tech came out to seal it), strip on closet not replaced(tech came out to replace), front leveling jack still will stop on its own when the auto grounding is engaged (nothing done)  and he said it would be washed (not done). After many emails about the work being done, it finally took me saying it was like pulling teeth to get answers to get answers. Of course it was one excuse after another as to why it wasn't done. Rep at the store was Darrell Sexton, his paper work didn't match what he told us as from the date we brought it in to the date he says it was ready. The tag on the camper says we brought it in on 10/7/2016 his paperwork says 10/10/2016 to the promise date we were told about a month to his paper work saying 1/15/2017 to the date completed as being 12/28/2016 when I have the email saying it is ready on 2/6/2017. Also in that time frame our registration expired and Darrell had told us we could get a plate to bring it to the RMV for them to verify the VIN number on the RV and then we were told when we showed up to get the RV that he couldn't do it. Everything in the paperwork is just to make him look good. This whole experience has really turned us against Camping World. After we told Darrell about the front jack he went inside and after trying to find him and the store getting ready to close we gave up and left in discus at this whole experience."
2,1,"Wish I could do a 1/2 star
They had my RV 31/2 weeks for some small warranty work items. After I  had to email to check status , they called back and said unit was ready.

You guessed it, first camping trip from picking it up,
all the problems were still not fixed."

2,1,"I would not refer anyone to buy an RV from here.
The sales department is awful. I literally walked in, looked at 4 units and put a deposit down. The experience was awful for the easiest sale of their month. They have no knowledge of the campers they are trying to sell. I had to google all the answers to the questions I had. The vin # model does not match the sticker on the camper, but no one seems to caste. The finance department is unresponsive, have to call over and over to get a call back. The delivery process is horrible. They barely told us how to use the brand new RV. Would have been nice to know the ins and outs and all the ""extras"" you need to buy before taking it off the lot. As a brand new camper, it should include very basic tools to use - or I should have been told I need to buy a black hose, before I got 3 hours away from Phoenix. Was promised that they would order missing pieces (from a brand new camper) that were broken, no response. Uneducated, no answers, clueless ... Please do yourself a favor and buy from another dealer. We wish we would have!"
2,1,"I would give zero stars if I could! Spent two hours in 117 degree heat looking at fifth wheels ! Wife and I decided on a redwood they had in stock after 3 days of trying to get someone to call me back so I could spend 80,000 on their lot and never received a call until I wrote a complaint on their website! I even called flagstaff to buy it from them and still have not received a call! Ended up at lazy days in Tucson and I am very happy with their service not pushy took the time neede to find what we wanted got the same model and year as camping world for 15,000 cheaper and had a lot of options including a genset"
2,1,"the buying process and sales guy was great. easy help us find what we wanted and gave us all the knowledge on the trailers we where looking at. they get 5 stars 
now the sercive center is a whole nother story i would give them 0 starts if i could. we bought our trailer mid april it has be used 4 times. its now mid september we took it in august 18th for some small fixes and for the dinning table bench falling out of the wall pulling screws and all our with it. so they have had our trailer for nearly a month now. have have not received one call or email letting us know what's going on with it. my husband called many times and left messages with both the parts manager and our rep. and no return anything. i called and even went in to find out something. nothing besides they are sending the info to the warranty company. okay great. but our trailer is 4 1/2 months old it shouldnt have to go through warranty. and to not return messages for phone calls or to update people the process on their stuff is the part that really pisses me off."
2,1,"Absolutely the worst experience I've had since becoming a Fulltime RVer. My rig has been in their shop for going on 2 months. It took over a month just to receive a quote on work that I wanted done, labor price may have been reasonable to ""do it right"" (why would I want it done wrong?); however, that took it out of my interest.
Still waiting on response from Thor on what I believe to be warranted repairs. At least that's what CJ my Service Advisor has told me.
If this is the way Camping World and Thor care for customers after the sale, they can count mine twice. First and last that is...

Today I picked up my RV. Understandably there were no ""warm fuzzies"" waiting for me, but there was yet another surprise. For the life of me I could not help being shocked to have a ""diagnostic"" charge for giving me an estimate on cost and installation of a rain sensor fan roof vent. Never, ever, anywhere by anyone have I ever been charged a fee for a purchase/installation of a new product. I would have understood the charge if they were troubleshooting an existing product's problem and I elected not to repair it, but..."
2,1,"Wish I'd read the previous reviews before I came here.  A horrible, frustrating, waste of time experience trying to get our RV water heater replaced.  Parts were screwed up resulting in a week's delay, and I had to actually find the part number for them to reorder the part.  Parts were literally double the price of other sources.  I never received most of the calls they promised and getting information was like pulling teeth.  When the reordered part did finally arrive they failed to schedule my RV in the shop and the SERVICE MANAGER refused to come out and meet with me to discuss the situation.  I waited some time and he never appeared, just kept sending out excuses (the general manager did eventually fix the situation, more or less.)  Took 10 days for a 3 day repair and when we finally got so angry we just left the water heater still did not function.  6 Camping World techs worked on it for 5 hours and couldn't get it working.  (A couple of days later a 1 man repair shop in another town diagnosed it and repaired it in under 5 minutes.)  On the plus side they did provide us with a parking spot in their lot, saving us campground costs.  Unfortunately the promised shore power connection never materialized.  Go ANYWHERE else to get your RV worked on."
2,5,"My used rv trailer purchase was a great experience , My salesman Jay L. made me feel at home and is a hell of a guy. I would send anyone I knew who was in the market for an rv to see Jay.  I bought an expandable trailer as is, it does need some work in the plumbing area of the trailer, but I feel I got it at a price that is fair. They even replaced a couple of tires due to the safety inspection.   So again I think they were very fair  I am happy and the wife is getting happy.  Lol."
2,1,"So disappointing! 
We bought a brand new camper at this Camping World. The camper had a pre-existing tear in the flooring (they weren't sure why it was there) and a corner piece of some paneling was lifting away from the entertainment center (from the heat? Idk). ""Not to worry"", we were told, ""we can replace your flooring no problem"", we were told. 
""We can glue the paneling back down, no problem"", we were told. 
So we bought the camper and also bought the Camping World's warranty. 
While signing our paperwork, they ""fixed"" the panels with staples... I showed them that there were not any staples on any other panels and now the staples were coming through the opposite side panels inside the cabinets and they even missed a corner of the panel that was still not attached... I should have ran then, but they assured me it was not right and they will fix it.
So we took the camper home for 2 weeks to play with it:)
We then dropped it off and they kept it for 2-3 weeks , when we come to pick it up our brand new ""fixed"" camper.... While doing a walk through on site, my husband and I open the slide-out to see all the pretty new flooring, when something under the slide out catches on the new flooring and rips another hole it. 
Also, that paneling that was supposed to be fixed and ""glued"" back to TV center, was stapled all around the square! Those sharp staple ends were still sticking out of the paneling on the opposite side of the TV center, with chipped pieces of wood all laying inside the cabinet. As if nobody saw that... Or maybe didn't think we would care. (FYI - staples are not used to secure any other original paneling on the TV center)
**New list of ""fixes"": new flooring AGAIN, new flooring that was not extended into the bottom of the TV center (as it was to begin with), shave off screw heads under kitchen table (that was the cause of the slide out catching on the flooring), and try to fix the panels AGAIN (order new wall panels for the original side and the side THEY ruined with staples).
Another 2-3 weeks later, we go to pick up the fixed camper (as they told us it was all done over the phone)... The new flooring has bubbles everywhere! Seriously?! Who is your quality manager that reviews all the work that is done?.. Not just a couple bubbles, not all small. Some bubble were more than 6-8 inches long. The paneling that was replaced had been cut too short on 1 corner and didn't fit snugly.. The paneling on the opposite side (that they ruined) was shoved in too snugly and caused the top of the wood paneling to be chipped and cracked. 
So disappointed in the quality of everything here. I mean I'm really not a complainer and my husband and I are very understanding people. I'm NOT trying to be picky, really if it was maybe one small bubble in the flooring or one side of the paneling was perfect and the other was less than perfect, I might not be writing this review. But IT IS OBVIOUS no one cares about their workmanship here. 
We then requested to speak to a manager who agreed that the flooring and paneling was not done correctly and assured us he would ""email"" several people (managers of quality dept., parts., etc) and get back to us for more repairs - I assume. 
So we had to leave the camper AGAIN....
We are making payments on a camper that we can not use. I don't know what to do.
It's just POOR quality of work that has completely taken the excitement out of having a camper.
This story is to be continued..."
2,1,"After going to other Camping World Sale who were very pleasant and honest and helpful just boggles my mind that the camping world in Avondale  is basically run by the people have no moral values I believe they take advantage of the retirees and snowbird again I would never buy anything at that Camping World . And definitely not an RV.
I am still waiting for the content of my fifth wheel to be addressed and fix .
It has almost a year."
2,1,"Geez. I should have seen the reviews before I walked into this place! Our sales guy was Steve, and he was practically asleep at the wheel. He wanted to start by bringing us to the office, and the reality is we just wanted to get out and look at some trailers. Since this was our first foray into buying, we had a ton of questions, which he seemed to not really care about and didn't give us really any answers. He just drove around pointed out a few trailers opened a few more, and didn't give us any information at all. He seemed completely disinterested and lacked any motivation whatsoever to make us excited about getting into what most people would consider a recreational vehicle LOL. Hint, Recreation means fun. Maybe Camping World needs to teach these guys that the reasons we are there, is 1. We can afford to buy an RV, and 2. We are going to use it for recreation, which means were excited about buying one. Maybe if this guy was a little more excited, and gave us any information whatsoever, we would have been more motivated to dig a Little Deeper. No wonder La mesa just absolutely kills these guys when it comes to Trailer Sales. Definitely not going here again."
2,1,"Well after reading some reviews i think everything was already said!!!

I will attempt a Short story, if you think you have to buy anything from this place go online and do all the research you can possibly do cause no one at this place has a clue of what they are doing, i am surprised they are able to stay open!! the only reason i still bought from this place  is cause me and my wife decided we wanted the Coleman QS10 and they are the only place that sells it, i have regretted every day sense buying it. i cringe every day i go in there for anything. 

After my 1st trip out it rained for 15 min and the pop-up started leaking and the teeth on the zipper door broke off, not fun for 1st time buyer, very irritating not Camping Worlds fault but when taking it in to get fixed that was something else. I was told to go see person after person how do they not know who i need to talk to? after getting to the correct counter where the service people are suppose to be... naturally no one was there to help me. And the lady told me to stand there said that a person would walk through door at some point ""who knows when"" to help me. I thought this was crazy so i asked "" so i am suppose to stand here and wait for someone to magically appear at some point to help me and you have no idea when that might be?'"" she said well basically yes. REALLY??? What kind of place is this? I let her know i am not doing this and to call on the intercom or what ever to find this person, so she went back and got they guy...now how hard was that. 

That is just one bad experience  of many I have had with this place in the short time I have had to deal with them. I would write more but i would be here all night and it seems from other reviews i am not the only one with a bad experience here. 

If i could give this place a negative rating i would!!!"
2,1,"we bought our 5th wheel from here and have had nothing but issues, from the loan, so the set up and the service. We even took issues to the corporate office and that took  three calls just to get them to respond.
They blame the warranty company that company blames camping world. We never get straight answers or help now we have another issue and for days no one will answer the phone is service. do yourselves a  favor stay away from this place!"
2,1,"My issue with this business is the service advisors. We were without our RV for 5 months because of the way they are NOT organized. Upon getting it back, it had to be taken to Eugene OR Camping World to have the inferior work done previously, fixed correctly. 

They ordered wrong items, lost an insurance check and were extremely difficult to work with. Communication was fairly non-existent."
2,1,I bought a new 5th wheel trailer from them & what a mistake that was. If you like the run around & migraine headaches do business with them. If not stay completely away. This dealership is a JOKE!!
2,1,"We purchased our diesel-pusher motor-home/coach from Camping World on 8/11/18.  In purchasing the coach, there is a $5,000 fee that has to be paid to go through the coach from top to bottom  (including the engine and transmission,etc.).  When we picked up the coach we were told by David and George that we ""could drive this to New York City with no problem"".  Steve was our salesman and told us ""it drove like a dream"".  We opted not to buy the warranty, because we had just paid this $5,000 to go through EVERYTHING.  We brought it home and found it is pulling to the left (out of alignment) and the temperature gauge fluctuates from hot to cold when it should not be doing this.  My husband called Camping World in Avondale several times and left voicemails...no calls were ever returned.  He visited Camping World in Avondale and spoke with Alicia (who by the way, has been the only one helpful and responsive) and explained these issues and that he wanted a return call from David and/or George regarding these issues....or anyone else for that matter.  Actually, when Alicia looked in the system and read the notes, it specifically  said in the notes in the computer that the coach ""pulls to the left"".  To date, we still have not heard back from David or George at Camping World.  My husband even made a visit last week and the line was out the door at Service and people said they had been standing there for 20 minutes with no assistance.  We are still owed a latch for one of the storage compartments that is noted, but have not heard back that this is in and ready to be installed either.  We paid $75,000 for our coach, which included the $5,000...you would think that you would get some service after the sale from someone.  We are incredibly disappointed, which is quickly turning to anger, that this has happened.  I would NEVER recommend anyone to buy a trailer or motor-home from Camping World.  We even have the 1 year free of Good Sam...but that is also through Camping World.  Would they even show up when we break down???  I am hoping that someone there sees this review and will possible reach out now??  Charles & Bobi Tice"
2,1,Had repair work done on an RV after it sustained extensive damage here in Avondale. We purchased airline tickets from DFW to pick it up the day it was suppose be ready. It wasn't ready. We had to spend the night at a local hotel so they could finish the work. It was now suppose to be ready to go at 10 AM that following day. It wasn't. It's now 11 o'clock and we are still sitting in the lobby waiting for it to be completed. The only updates I have received are when I go and ask what's going on. We have 1100 miles of driving ahead of us to get home and we are running out of time. Ugh.
2,1,"Campingworld service department was a joke.  We will not be taking our RV there again.  Excessive time to analyze the service needed and then not done.  Better go somewhere else, if you want work done."
2,1,Don't buy anything from here they sell lemons and don't give a crap about paying customers! I hope someone does something to put these people out of business.
2,1,By far the worst one I've been in mainly no parking only go here if you have to cannot understand why anybody would have Parking like this where they don't care about the customer at all
2,1,"This place deserves no stars at all. Now let me tell you why. 

What we liked: 
Our salesperson. This was our first RV. He was fast, personable and found us what we needed at the price we wanted. Two weeks after we got our Class C camper, he left. I bet I know why.

What we didn't like:
1) They had our RV for at least 4 weeks. It was nearly new. We were told they would check it top to bottom. When we got there the generator was not working. Don't understand why it wasn't fixed. Then the tech that was doing the walkthrough couldn't get the backup camera to work. Back it went to the shop. A 3-hour pick up turned out to be a 5.5-hour trip. The tech never finished the walkthrough and went home! As we were leaving we noticed that a drawer was broken! So we had to fix that ourselves, AND pay for the part. 
2) We figured out later that the tech didn't know that the battery had to be on for the camera to work. How is that possible? And, our seats got scuffed with his dirty shoes to make it worse.
3) Two days after we had our RV the financial dept. called to tell us the bank had to check our credit. Umm, after we took possession? I had already locked my credit report (Thank you, Equifax). It takes $$$ and time to unlock it again. We were furious. It took us 3 weekends to get that done. Don't even tell me they didn't know I should have left it unlocked for the bank!! Who dropped the ball? To top it off, we can pay cash for this thing but they wouldn't give us the price we wanted unless they got the kickbacks for the financing. Oh, and we never got the $50 gift card we were promised.
4) Prepping the RV for Country Thunder and the AC would not come on. We had 48 hours to fix it. Have not even used it yet. 
5) Discovered part of my screen door was missing. No one even told me I would have to get that replace. Worse yet, they could have replaced it before I picked it up. I ordered a new part through Thor.
5) Oh, The Good Sam 24/7 assistance that we paid bank for-- apparently they don't mean 24/7 on  Christian holidays like Easter.
6) Called Avondale Monday, 3x with no human to answer the phone. Called Mesa Camping World, connected with a wonderful service foreman, Keith (I love you Keith) and he told me to come out immediately to take a look. In two minutes he found the problem. Avondale had not turned on the circuit breaker after they fixed the generator. ARE YOU KIDDING? I am pretty sure the tech I had, if he even still works there, didn't know anything about my vehicle. I'm pretty sure the rest, just don't care. So mismanaged.

Deleting Avondale's information from my phone. Hope to never go there again. Read the other reviews. I wish I had."
2,1,"STAY AWAY!!! 
 I tried telling the entire story of our Purchasing Adventure with these clowns and I'd written pages on the subject. I'll try again, with less detail on the horrible experience we had with Camping World. 
1.  While in their Retail Store, I was treated to a Service Employee talking over an unhappy customer who had not received a return call from him.. He was talking in loud tones to her and basically taking NO responsibility for HIS lack of customer service.. Then I got to hear him complaining with two other employees about HER attitude.. I lost the desire to do any shopping there.. Not a good sign.

2. We went shopping at Camping world with a written approval from our bank USAA. Camping World wouldn't even hold the RV without a 500 credit card, until they got the check from USAA in hand.. USAA sent the check overnight on the 5th (the day after the RV was purchased) Camping World had the check on the 6th, but our delivery wasn't scheduled until the 11th at 3:00pm..

3. On Sunday, May 10th, we discovered when my husband double checked with our Durango Dealer that we wouldn't be able to pull the trailer more than a few miles. We purchased a Dodge 1500 Truck and didn't need the hitch we'd purchased through Camping world which was included in the purchase price.

4. Monday Morning, May 11th, we went in with the truck, advised the sales rep we didn't need the Hitch, and wanted it removed from the contract. We were told we'd have the refund that afternoon when we signed the final paperwork.  We left the truck with them for installation of the trailer brake. I asked the sales rep, to contact me with the refund amount asap.. I never heard back from him.. Basically, Jerry was not at all involved, responsive or helpful after the original sale was completed.

5. When we came in for the walkthrough and delivery (which cost nearly $700.00) and asked for Jerry, we were referred to the man who did our walk through..  even though I'd specifically requested that we see Jerry since I still wanted to know the amount and the status of the Hitch Refund...  I expected a complete walk through ... NOT...While the guy that did our walk through at Camping world was very nice, I don't think he had the proper training for this.. He started off the Walk through by asking us if we had any questions.. If you are an RV novice , you don't know what to ask...  We had to insist on more info and actual practice of hitching and unhitcing  the trailer to the Truck.  Our representative did not know how our new Trailer brake worked either.  Not worth nearly 700.00

7.  All of the above would have been minor issues and not worth  writing a bad review..Just a casual warning to people we know to stay away from Camping World.. It was through Tim Doogan in Finance, that I determined for myself that Camping World is one of the worst places to purchase an RV.  He was rude, arrogant and extremly abbrasive during our entire time with him.  I had to refuse to sign the Purchase Agreement, until I got the amount of refund due us and how we'd be receiving it, before we even got the dollar amount... ON A POST-IT that we were shown..  not given.. We were told that the check wouldn't come to us, it'd go to USAA ""by Law"".. Ok..when?  Checks were only cut from the Mesa Location and only once a week..  We went through with the deal because my husband needed the RV for Tuesday morning... He works in Sedona and needed it as a place to live during his work week.. 

Tim Doogan did not return one of the many phone calls  we or our bank made to follow up for the refund check.. After almost 3 weeks, my husband left yet another voice mail advising that if he didn't get a return call with a check # for our refund, he would be taking this issue to the next level. Then he got a return call... Tim Doogan advised that their ""finance person THINKS she remembers sending the check""... Really? On Memorial Day weekend, May 26, Paul got a call from Tim Doogan, advising that they'd called USAA, got permission to send us the check, and would stop payment on the original check and reissue us the check to us.  To date, USAA has not received the check. We received the check yesterday, June 1st.   

People make mistakes, things take time, I sincerely doubt that Camping World cares one bit about Customer Service.. While I receive surveys, from banks after a phone call, and we received a customer service survey from Larry Miller Dodge, where we purchased the Truck, we have never received any kind of customer satisfaction survey from Camping World... Stay Away!!!!

2,1,"I have been around RVs for many years and have found most of the people in and around the industry to be helpful and professional. Camping World in Avondale seems to be the exception to this. I had sworn to never go to this store again after past experiences. However, today a friend at the resort we stay at needed help getting his trailer to a service appointment. I consented to help him and had the unfortunate experience of meeting a woman who claimed to be the store manager on duty. I don't believe I have ever met a more abrasive, less professional, store representative in my life, and that's saying something. She was confrontational and overbearing from the beginning and without provocation. I stopped trying to talk to her because the other employees were clearly embarrassed with her behavior. I, unfortunately, didn't get her name. Not that it will matter as I won't be back for any reason. A store that would let this individual interact with the public, let alone make decisions for the employees that were trying to do a good job, definitely doesn't need my business.

This place is horrible. Go to Walmart, buy online, drive to another state, do whatever it takes to avoid this experience.

I do want to say one of the service advisors - Dave I think - was trying really hard to help us. I really felt sorry for him"
2,1,"Worst experience ever! 

I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service from the camping world in Avondale AZ. The customer service experience is the worst I've received from any service based company. 
First, the service writer CJ was rude to me when I was dropping off the trailer, he was rushing me through the repair list, mind you these are the repairs that didn't get 100% complete. I needed help unhooking the trailer since my husband is the one to do all this but had to go to work so he dropped off the trailer and he left in my vehicle as I waited for our appointment and he had a poor attitude about and stated that it wasn't his responsibility to unhook. Which is fine but being that I work in customer service there are ways of communicating with customers no matter the message. Then half way through the list we are told moldings are completed only 90 days from purchase but yet when they were selling us the trailer they told us bumper to bumper repairs are covered through the 1 yr warranty. Then we were told that we can only request 8 repairs at a time. 
Secondly, when I returned to pick up my trailer I noticed that the repairs I had listed either got done very poorly (almost as if they felt it wasn't worth their time) and some items weren't even repaired. Mind you I had to wait several weeks for these repairs to be approved since they are under warranty then once approved they don't get done? How does a company operate this way? Is there any type of QC check or follow up?
Lastly, to top this bad experience off I sent an email to the service Writer CJ requesting resolution on these lack of repairs and to speak with the service manager but I didn't get a response until almost a week later but still not resolution or service manager response.  They certainly don't have a sense of urgency for customer service.
I came to Camping World because they are large, famous, and a reputable dealership for RVs, and I thought I was making the right choice in buying from them but this terrible experience proved to be otherwise."
2,1,"We've always been RV owners who have taken our RV unit to Camping World locations all over the country for new parts, service and whatever else we needed.  However, we had never had a dealing with their sales staff or needed warranty work until now.  The Avondale location is our first experience buying a new unit and dealing with warranty work from a Camping World.  

We bought a brand new unit at Avondale.  The verbal negotiations were made but several items weren't as originally offered.  Sales person offers one thing but the excuse of ""if we give you that, we'll void the warranty"" was used to get out of a bumper and a bike rack.  We didn't get either.  Okay, so the ""money man"" drew up the papers anyway.  He was rude and insulting.  However, from what we understand he is no longer there and that's a good thing.  We also had problems getting the title.  No one knew where it was and getting return calls required a visit to their Mesa location.

We also needed a few fixes on the RV unit we purchased.  The unit was back at Camping World several times.  Finally after the third attempt on the first fix, it was completed but nothing else was.  Communication was non-existent just like other reviewers indicated.  We called and left messages for Service Manager numerous times but  calls were not returned.  We had to actually drive in to the Camping World in Avondale to discuss problems or make the appointments.   Also, we were told it was Camping World's policy that an appointment was made to repair only one item at a time.  Each item needing repair needed a separate appointment.  What an inconvenience especially for snowbirds and there are a lot of those in Arizona during the winter.  

We had a water leak and our RV was back for repairs 3 times before it was finally fixed.  We weren't really sure what they did the first two times except give us lip service.  Damage to our outside panel was done by this leak. Service manager told us originally he'd order a new panel.  When asked about it later he told us to take it somewhere to get it painted ourselves.

Going forward we will not return to this Camping World for any repairs nor will we purchase from them again.  We've had to make repairs and replace a few things ourselves and will continue to do so unless it's an expensive item.  It's not worth dealing with this location. Are all Camping Worlds the same in regard to sales and warranty work?  Or, are they franchises with their own policies?  We don't know.

This is our personal opinion of this location and we were not happy.  So much for Marcus Lemonis' (CEO of Camping World) philosophy of practices, procedures and people."
2,5,"I have two Camping Worlds within 10 miles of my home, however Kelly Rhea and all I dealt with here in Avondale AZ  made my 750 mile trip more than worth while. We took care of all the details over the Net or phone and all was ready and waiting when I arrived.  I would encourage any interested purchasers to contact Kelly and give him a shot at your business you won't be disappointed."
2,1,"If I didn't work so hard at trying to be a positive person, the experience we've had at Camping World would likely make me miserable and depressed. This place is absolutely horrible. The single good thing they have going for them is our salesman Hal."
2,5,the sales staff at this location bent over backwords to hlp me and I wasn't the easiest person to help. my hat is off to Don & Corey thank you so much
2,5,"I am a first time RV buyer. I looked for over a year and found the floor plan I wanted at Camping World. My wife and I were greeted by a smiling and eager to please Greg Bennett and I am so glad he chose us to serve that day. He listened to what I wanted and didn't try to sell me on anything else. It must be difficult to work with people who really have no idea what it takes to own a travel trailer or even how to get the thing off the lot. I would recommend them to anyone who is in the market especially newbies because they do know their stuff and will help you all the way.
Be sure though to look for Greg Bennett he is aces with us."
2,1,"Word of advice.   Stay away.  Bought 2016 trailer in May , took out once , took back to fix items. Picked up then to take back in 3 days , job not done correctly.   They still have trailer today with no idea of when I will get it back. THIS IS SEPTEMBER!!!"
2,5,What a great experience we had buying our first travel trailer. No pressure just a genuinely nice salesman! We went to La Mesa at first and it was a bunch of lies and promises that weren't kept. Go to camping world and see Larry. He was the best! Thank you Larry! You're the greatest!
2,1,"I have called at least 5 times and left multiple messages just to set an appointment with service without and return call. I have never worked so hard to spend money with a business. Was going to buy tires, get oils changed and rig detailed. Guess they are not interested in over a $4000 sale."
2,4,We purchased an rv at Camping World and were treated very well. All the employees were very helpful.
3.5,5,"I bought a 2017 Retro 176S. I'm in love with this camper! But the reason why I'm in love is due to Rick listening to what I wanted in a camper! 
My husband and I were looking for a toy hauler, but everyone knows I. Love. Shasta's! Well we weren't finding the toy hauler of our dreams so I went back to see them and Rick says: "" Did you see that red one out there?"" I said ""No, I haven't found a Retro I liked"" He said I should just go take a look and reluctantly I did so.... WELL! (LOL!) It was a size of Retro I hadn't seen before. Just like a Shasta but has a slide for the dinette! HOORAY!!!! I was blown away by how this team listens to the customer! The finance team heard me too! They got me payments that fit my budget and my camper is now in its forever home! I love my camper and the staff at Kamper City are now family!"
3.5,2,"I had an awning replaced on my pop-up camper. They were very nice. Hilarious installation mistakes ensued. They installed the awning hardware backward on the canvas, which made setting it up extremely confusing because the poles that go toward the ground were angled toward the pop-up, and those that were supposed to be attached to the pop-up were pointing at the ground. If you attached those poles to the pop-up, you would have to break the hardware to orient the other poles at the ground. When that was figured out and reversed (an easy process), it became clear that the anchor points were installed in the wrong place. I found the installation manual online and sure enough, the anchor points go under the awning at the top of the pop-up, not under the canvas you snap onto the pop-up when it's popped up. In hindsight, how can you attach an awning pole through the canvas? Should I have cut a hole? I remounted the anchor points myself, but now I have 4 little holes (from the screws) in the side of my pop-up I have to fill with caulk."
3.5,5,"We just purchased our 2nd camper. Jason was our sales person again and as  always very helpful. This is definitely the place to purchase you camper. Staff are always very nice and eager to help. The owner is really a great guy, very friendly ! 
Thank you Kamper City for all that you do for us campers.."
3.5,5,"My husband and I just bought a camper from Kamper City after dealing with an extremely rude sales staff over at Camping World. We dealt with Rick, who was great and easy to work with. I appreciate the fact that he's a straight shooter like me, he made it easy to choose between the two campers we were looking at. I had a minor issue that had nothing to do with our sales person, and it was promptly dealt with by management. I was extremely pleased. Having grown up with a father who has worked in upper management my whole life, I believe in the ""the customer is always right"" motto and clearly the management side of Kamper City does as well.   All around great customer service and nice campers on the lot."
3.5,5,"Kamper City saved our vacation. We did something stupid when hooking up our travel trailer to our tow vehicle and encountered a problem on I71. We were lucky to be approaching an exit, and pulled off the highway and into the closest parking lot. I made two calls for help. Place number one was helpful, but advised us to call Kamper City because they were much closer. Kamper City advised us what we could do to try to limp the 10 miles or so to get to them. Fingers crossed, we took our time and made it to them they helped us out and charged us a very fair price. An hour after we arrived at Kamper City, we were all set, and back on the road to start our vacation. If the were closer to home, they would always be my choice for service."
3.5,1,"BUYER BEWARE! Worst customer service! 
I purchased a camper in July. Several things were wrong from the beginning. The DVD player does not work; they forgot to give us our screen door; they delivered the camper completely filthy; we noticed small puddles on the floor in the bathroom and living room on several occasions; the slide makes a grinding sound then it seems to ""pop"" into the next gear. I called and left countless messages for the Service Manager. NOW WE HAVE SEVERE WATER DAMAGE! Water is coming through the light fixtures, mold is forming on the walls. It's a mess. When I called the owner, he told me to call my insurance company. I explained I have a warranty on the camper and I can't seem to get the Service Manager to assist me. He didn't even acknowledge that the Service Manager had a responsibility to call customers back. But he did say that NO warranty ever covers water and whatever damage that has been caused is due to something that I did! His comments were rude, uncalled for and completely wrong! I contacted the manufacturer. They too, were completely appalled by his responses. I will have to work with them for a resolution. Lesson learned - I will never buy a camper from Kamper City again!"
3.5,5,"We recently placed a parts order and not only were the guys in the department helpful, they made sure we received our parts quickly.  We'll definitely be back!"
3.5,1,"Have you ever dealt with a fine, family run establishment that takes care of their customers and works hard to earn your business by going the extra mile? Kamper City is the OPPOSITE. I was greeted by a rude salesperson. Told to wait for a manager who never came, so I left. Trying to negotiate with ""ol tom"" is laughable at best. You'd expect any rational human who lists a used RV  $700 over the blue book value to at least negotiate with you. Nope, not at Kamper City. After employing all the worn out ""used car salesman"" tactics like making you wait an absurd amount of time to consider an offer, he countered with... his original sticker price. 

I wish I had read all the online reviews before showing up on the lot. Seems like I'm not the only one with a terrible experience. Im actually glad he turned down my offer, seems like their warranty department is abysmal. It's truly remarkable that these guys are even in business. If they were the last RV dealership on Earth, id rather tow around a cardboard box with a pillow in it than deal with them."
4.5,4,Got me right in because we were getting ready to leave on our trip. Even though I know they were backed up. I also felt the price was fair and everyone was very friendly.
4.5,5,Thank you for taking care of my 5th wheel. They did a great job with the fix. Erick the owner is a stand up guy and wish there were more companies out there like this one
4.5,5,"I have been using RV Master Techs for the last three years on two different motorhomes -- a National Dolphin and Country Coach.  Jason and Daniel have been incredible in diagnosing and repairing every single problem I've had with both coaches:  electrical, refrigerator, slider, and battery. Jason was even able to find a lamp replacement for our front door handle.  Nothing seems to stump them.   In our Country Coach they have changed out our old window shades with new MCD dual shades.  They are only one of two MCD dealers in Arizona, and for my money, they have earned this exclusivity.  I have also bought their preventive maintenance program for my AC, furnace, and other appliances -- a very good value for all the work they do. I recommend making an appointment; I always do, and that way they finish the work in one day."
4.5,5,"Quality repair facility.
I had a scheduled appointment about 10 days out....made with Jason. Arrived on the scheduled date and they immediately began the repair without any delay. Challenging repair-remove a mangled tow hitch from my RV and replace with a new one.  Had a bent frame, bent basement locker. Replacement factory hitch unavailable and between Jason and Matt, they custom fabbed a new beefy hitch. Fabricator Matt outstanding, super detail oriented! After he straightened the frame and locker, he tied the new hitch into the frame beyond where the factory hitch was installed to insure everything was straight.... and strong by welding in additional steel tubing, Well worth the premium ($) to get it done right.  Very impressed with shop and all staff, very knowledgeable (Dana too). They worked straight thru (2 days) until the job was 100% complete, not cutting off and working on other projects which I really appreciated. I highly recommend this shop.

4.5,5,"Called Camping World and explained we were on the road and had our A/C unit burn up, the first appointment offered was over a month out. Called RV Masters and they had us come out, they saw what p[arts they needed, ordered the parts and had us come back when the parts came in and we have the A/C repaired all within less than 10 days! Jason and the staff are vary friendly and professional and care about their customers. This is the second time we have used RV Masters with excellent results each time!!!"
4.5,5,"I arranged from Illinois the purchase of a 2007 Airstream Interstate, and found Mike about as honest, straightforward and easy to deal with as anyone I could imagine.  The rig was exactly what I wanted, Jason arranged new tires for me, and when I arrived for pickup Stewart had the rig spotless inside and out.

I couldn't be more pleased, and wish they were closer so I could use them for service. :)"
4.5,1,"I scheduled a mobile detailing of my brand new 38 foot 5th wheel.  I had read the reviews and expected great things from this company.  I also expected a truck to show up like the picture on the web site, instead I got this old white van with a couple of gentlemen.  They were nice enough, but from the start I felt like I got some contracted out crew and for them it was a rush job. In less than two hours they completely washed, waxed, to include the fiberglass roof a 38 foot monster 5th wheel.  They missed lots of areas, left water spots, so you know that was never waxed, did not completely wipe/buff out areas and in general did a poor job on the waxing.  I think they felt like they did not need to do much since it was brand new.  Now let's talk pricing.  The internet special was $299 for a wash and wax.  The gentlemen honored that, but when I asked about doing the fiberglass roof, that was a $175 additional.  I knew he was making up for the $299 special, but I was willing to give in to that if it was done right.  It was not!  When he was done so fast, I asked him if he did the roof and he said yes.  I went up and checked it and again I could see dried areas of standing water so I know that was not touched and when I felt the roof, it was chalky.  No buffing out up there.  I asked him about it and he showed me the product he supposedly used for the roof, ""rubber roof protectant"", on a fiberglass roof!  He said it would give me the same UV protection.  You have got to be kidding.  They took my $474 check and it was cashed probably on the way home.  RV Master Techs may have an ""A"" team, but I can tell you that I got the crew that I am not sure I would even call the second string.  Overall, I am totally dissatisfied with the entire job and will never use RV Master Techs again if this is their accepted level of quality.  If a white van shows up for your mobile detailing, send them away!"
5,5,These guys are truly awesome. I come in here with the craziest ideas and they help me make it happen. They always take care me and give me great pricing. Enough said.
5,5,"I pulled into Spectrac needing a dust cap cover for an RV that we rented.  The gentleman at the counter had one of his service guys take a look at the bearings. He said they looked pretty dry, they were just closing up for Labor Day weekend. His tech cleaned the bearings with some brake cleaner, put some fresh grease in there and gave me a dust cap cover. 
ALL AT NO CHARGE!  They know what customer service is all about.
I have been going here for years and will continue to come back."
5,5,Best customer service ive had In like forever. Brian Gaustad has gone above and beyond on several occasions. He guided me thru a camping trailer build. Several times when i bought the wrong product he returned it no problem and got me the right stuff. He hooked me up with bearing caps when i kept destroying the ones I purchased. Always answerd every dumb question i had. I had a lot. I highly recommend them
5,5,Would highly recommend to anyone having alignment issues with their RV or trailer. Staff friendly and knowledgeable.
5,5,"I'm so glad that I called Chandler out to have my trailers bearings repacked.

I found out that another one of the ""FIVE STAR Reviewed"" trailer companies out there on yelp had not packed them correctly.  This is why I had a MAJOR bearing failure after only 750 miles of use (And got stranded on the road in another state).  When the old bearings were removed, the grease was completely broken down and smelled burnt.  It appears that this ""other"" company did not use the best marine grease.  I'm hoping to NEVER have to deal with another bearing failure on the road again.

In any event, Chandler was quick to respond to my request, punctual with the appointment time (right on time), professional in our conversations, and did not hurry the job.   In fact, he spent almost 50% more time on the job than the other trailer repair company I used last year.

I will never make that mistake again of calling the wrong person for the job.  Chandler will be my go to person for all my future trailer maintenance/repairs.

Thanks Chandler!"
5,5,"Honest, skilled trailer mechanic who does quality work at very affordable rates. The best at what he does in town."
5,5,"So I had Chandler come out and he was absolutely AMAZING and very professional! I had a couple of big problems with my black tank and a cable valve with a leak and he was able to diagnose the problem and fix it! As a single woman, I felt like he was VERY fair with me on the cost! Would recommend him to anyone with any problem! Thanks again!!!!!"

Moving across country I don't have a lot of time he showed up on time and installed the hitch and wiring in no time. He smiled even though the heat was intense was such a great sport. He also guided me in making a purchase beforehand in what I would need (I'm a girl) lol Everything went smooth and now I can take hitch up my jeep to haul it across to Nashville. Thanks Zia I wish all companies were like you!!!!"

2.5,2,"I found the coach I have been looking for at Premium Coach Group. I flew cross country on a $1000 three day trip to Arizona. Many high end coaches inside an AC building. Steve Bennett walked me outside to the 2002 Newell with solar panels. The panels were covered  with bird poop. The exterior was damaged in places, the engine and gen compartments were dirty and parts leaking fluids. Llights that did not work, pilot seat did not recline, windshield screen broken and the detail was a 5 out of 10. I asked for detail photos but he must of got busy and I booked my trip and no photos. Steve was knowledgeable and I did not feel pressure to buy that coach.  If he had sent photos I would not of spent a grand and three days of my time last week. I asked to be compensated for half my costs, but, no reply to my email."
3.5,5,"So many great things about this place, Costco is in walking distance. The staff are friendly and helpful. The residents are lovely. The bathrooms are clean but could be updated a bit. Overall a great place to stay, we enjoyed our visit."
3.5,3,"I would not call it a resort. It is a lot of mobile homes and many people living in there RVs there. We had no problem parking our 45 ft RV.  Nice office staff. Had planned to be there 2 days, and stayed 4 days. We will stop again if we pass by on the way home."
3.5,4,Great RV Park for big rigs. We are 67 feet including our trailer. We have hose extensions otherwise it would have been an issue. Couldn't get TV but that was fine. The kids could only use the pool from 12-2 and 5-7 and it said no kids in the jacuzzi. Our kids are teenagers and nobody said a word about being there outside of those hours. As others said it's in the middle of a mobile home park and you have to walk pretty far to the dumpster or they pick up Mondays. Very friendly staff. Enjoyed our stay!
3.5,3,"I did not stay at this park. It looks nice, the customer service is good. Very friendly. I just want to tell others who are looking to stay month to month that they do not accept children."
3.5,3,"Office hours too short only 10-5 , late checking can not have key for restroom & shower and pool."
3.5,5,We recently stayed at this rv park for 4 days. We swam in the pool everyday and enjoyed the jacuzzi as well. The hook ups and space were all good. It is a quiet rv park that had a good feel to it. We brought our German shepherd with us.
3.5,5,This is the best resort I have ever been to. Everyone is friendly and the staff is super helpful. Great activities and great activity director.
3.5,5,"This is a great RV park. We were there only 2 nights, but we'd gladly stay longer. The resort offers lots of entertaining classes and activities. There is a nice indoor pool and hot tub. The activity center is clean and welcoming and there are convenient and clean laundry and shower facilities. Everyone was friendly, including the other guests. They had at least 3 fenced-in dog runs, conveniently located. It seemed like everyone had a dog, so there were lots of folks out walking in the very neat surroundings. The location is near the intersection of highways 101 and 17, so it's easy to get around town. It's a terrific location whether you're looking for a destination or just passing through."
3.5,1,"Obviously they don't want business. We attempted to book for our campervan. When we told them we would require electric only and wouldn't be using the sewer hookup, we were told we could not stay if we didn't use sewer. Ridiculous! Never encountered a business in which I am willing to pay full price for all services and be denied service."
3.5,3,"Resort is a real stretch .. It's a 30 year old trailer park with 90% of the sites filled with park models and RV's thrown in-between.. Nice pool & spa.. Showers are old & small only 3 in the whole park for women & 3 in the mens room.. Showers are Not handicapped accessible.. Nice library, free ice machine. Pull through sites are all rock and not very level.. Concert patio pads are small & some are cracked. Palm trees are in the way and offer no shade..NO WIFI & NO CABLE.. The yearly RV sites are redone ( bigger patio pads, pavers etc) at the renters expense. The lots are very unlevel, tilting towards the street. They are also very close together.  We have been here several times & I have never seen anyone use the shuffleboard courts or bocce ball courts..Waste of space, Fruit trees at most of the permeant sites offer lemons and grapefruit.."
3.5,4,"This is mainly mobile home housing with several unshaded pull through sites for TT's and big rigs. Full hookups, restrooms, showers, pool, free ice on the honor system-no more than 3 scoops! Lots of amenities. Office staff was nice, they were also nice over the phone. I would stay here again, but not in July cuz it's just too hot. I would give it 5 stars if they had planted more trees for shade and to offer some privacy between spots cuz it's basically a gravel parking area for each rig with nothing but the electrical post between you and your neighbor, that's if you're traveling through and not living there. They do have park model homes for sale and that area is very pretty with landscaping between each model home."
3.5,5,"BEST / LARGEST LAUNDRY ROOM OF ANY RV PARK I HAVE USED. Other amenities like heated pool and such were very nice, activity room with concerts, etc., that short timers are welcome to join in with the full timers (many people live there full time / all winter."
3.5,5,"This place is clean and nice and well taken care of, a stark contrast to the place we had planned to stay. A quick phone call to the office got us an automated after hours message giving us all the instruction we needed. We feel very safe and comfortable here. The spots are nice and big and the grounds are nice. Rates are reasonable for the area. Shopping is close if you need anything. Over all I think it was a great find and I would recommend it to anyone. My daughter is at GCU and I'm sure we will be back."
3.5,5,"We stayed at this RV park for two nights. There are many permanent Mobile homes in the park but spread out over the park there are many spaces available for rv's. The staff is courteous and helpful, everything is spotless and appealing. We will definitely stay here again when in the area!"
3.5,1,"We tried to reserve an Rv space for January. Stopped in today and spoke with 2 clerks and the manager. Courteous enough but refused to rent a spot to us because we have 2 teen age daughters that are not even going to be staying with us while my wife has some ongoing medical treatments in Scottsdale. Without calling me a liar they refused us service because they would not trust us to not bring the kids. I told them that they had my word and that they could just throw us out but that was not good enough for the manager. Funny how there is a sign in the pool area with specific hours for children and they must be accompanied by an adult. They are well rated by Good Sam's also. I will be contacting Good Sams to downgrade their ratings!
Pass this park up, we will just take our Newmar elsewhere!!"
3.5,2,"This resort is in town and is primarily for ages 55 and older, but allows families to stay stay short-term.  We did not realize this when we made our reservation, but learned it quickly when we checked in and found out that kids can only use the pool 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening, and they are not allowed in the billiard room at all.  

It might be great for people 55 and older, who want to be in town and not out in nature, but my family and I were happy we only stayed one night as we were passing through the area."
3.5,5,"We love Desert Shadows RV Resort. The staff are friendly. The indoor pool is clean. The jacuzzi pool is large and clean, too. This park is RV & has many park models. This is our third stay here. They have storage for our 20' stacker trailer, or if we stay short term, we can rent a pull through site that's appx 80'. COSTCO is directly behind DS - super convenient along with a big mall with all the restaurants, Target, etc. We're 15 minutes from Anthem. Also easy to get to - 1/2 mile off I- 17."
3.5,1,Beware the guys in the golf carts that work here. I'd  call them trailer park nazis but it would give nazis a bad name. This is a glorified trailer park.  Not an RV Resort
3.5,4,"If I only rated this park on its amenities, I would give it a 5 star. The sites are what brings the rating down.  This is more a park model resort than an RV park.  The RVs are in ""lots"" instead of ""sites"" and are squeezed in between park model homes.  The lots are very unlevel, tilting towards the street.  We needed to use several levels of leveling blocks under our front wheels in order to level the coach.  They are also very close together.  If our back window opened up, I could reach out and shake hands with the people behind us.  And with our living room slideout extended there is only about a foot between it and the pickup truck belonging to the person next to us.  Free cable and wifi are available at the office complex only.  In order to get cable at your site, you have to contact the cable company and pay their rates.  Same for wifi.  We don't need cable and have our own wifi hotspot so it didn't really bother us.  They don't accept credit cards for monthly stays, only cash or check.  I suggest you pay the deposit for the back gate key so that you can get to a traffic light if you want to make a left turn on the highway.  The amenities are another thing altogether.  The laundry room is large and clean, with plenty of room on the tables to fold your clothes.  Washers cost $1.25, dryers are $0.50 for 20 minutes.  There is a sitting area with a tv and magazines in the laundry room.  There's a large, heated indoor pool and hot tub.  Outside are shuffleboard courts and bocce ball courts.  An extensive library also has two tables for jigsaw puzzles and several computers.  There are also a billiards room, card room, exercise room, etc.  There is always some activity going on at this park."
3.5,4,Nice and quiet big lake with a lot of rocks so be careful wear swim shoes or flip flops. I took my flip flops off and accidentally scraped my foot on a rock and couldn't swim any longer because i didn't want to get any infections. But besides my clumsiness and the rocks the lake is beautiful and warm. I will probably not go again.
3.5,4,"More than a campground. A Great Day Adventure by Lake Mead.

   Recently, I had two awesome day adventures at the Boulder Beach Campground. On New Year's Eve 2011, I was set on using the Alan Bible Visitor Center parking lot as a trailhead for the Historic Railroad Tunnel Trail. It was closed indefinitely for refurbishment, and the inadequate River Mountains Loop Trail parking lot was full. Instead of driving back to Henderson, I paid $10 to the Lake Mead National Recreation Area fee station, then set out for a day adventure in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.

  Anxious to get out of my car and spend time at Lake Mead, I parked in the Lake Mead RV Village (second right after fee station). I followed the country road a few hundred feet north, and was exploring Boulder Beach Campground. I walked in a northeast direction toward Lake Mead. Past the campsites, I made a right, and walked the road connecting the Boulder Beach Campground to Lake Mead. What stood out was the canopy of trees. In certain spots, the Boulder Beach Campground in the Nevada desert reminded me of a campground on the Florida Gulf Coast without the humidity. 

  With the exception of zero vending machines, Boulder Beach Campground provides essential services for day use. There are plentiful shaded picnic tables, rest rooms, a Ranger station, sufficient parking (third right from fee area), and benches. The adjacent Lake Mead RV Village features a camp shop that is open til 5 pm.

  A serene Lake Mead is the star of the campground. It is a serene Lake Mead where waterfowl, fish, and tranquillity outnumber motor boats. It is a serene Lake Mead that is more suitable for sight seeing than swimming. It is a serene Lake Mead with acres of shore line that provides sufficient breathing room, and a nice shoreline stroll. It is a serene Lake Mead where I ended 2011 high on life.

   Boulder Beach Campground is a suitable trailhead for hiking in cooler weather. The River Mountains Loop Trail travels along the west preiphery parallel to Lake Shore Drive. On April 21, I used Boulder Beach Campground as a trailhead for the Lake Mead segment of the River Mountains Loop Trail. I cannot be more thankful to the canopy of trees at the campground. April 21 was a day of record breaking temperatures, my bottle water went from frozen to near boiling in a couple miles.I was on the path to dehydration. I made it back to Boulder Beach Campground and  I settled my head on a picnic table, recuperating in a shade of tranquillity. This left me with the opinion that if the other park guests are respectful, this is a relaxing place to read and have a picnic. 

  On days where high temperatures is not boiling bottle water, I recommend using Boulder Beach Campground as a traihead for two hikes. Hike 1: Walking the River Mountains Loop Trail to mile marker 14, where there is a scenic overlook with mesmerizing vistas of the Lake Mead basin. Hike 2: River Mountains Loop Trail South to the Historic Railroad Tunnels Trail.

  My day adventures continued when I got back in the car. I turned right and drove scenic Lake Shore Drive to the Lake Mead Parkway fee station. Ten miles of beautiful scenery. I recommend driving the scenic Lake Shore Drive to Nevada Route 564, which turns into Interstate 215. There are additional overlooks and points of interest."
3.5,5,"This review is for the beach area only. There is a large gravel parking lot and a short walk to the beach area. The beach is very rocky, so water shoes are needed. The beach is clean and the water is clear. We even saw fish! My 2.5 year old loved the beach and the water stays shallow for a while so it's good for young kids to play in the water. They also had a shack on the beach for free life vests if you wanted to use them. Overall, this is a nice beach to come to. There is no shade, so I would recommend an umbrella or tent!"
3.5,1,No privacy at all. People camping within arms length. Homeless people pulled in at 11:00pm one night and stayed within 15 feet of us making noise through the night. The next night a bunch of kids partied until 5:00am. They quickly take your money but make no effort to enforce rules. Kind of a dump.
3.5,1,"My husband asked about a certain prime spot which was coned off and he was told maintenance closed it down,not soon after the same camp host removed the cones for an RV. Which was obvious shady. This is not right it is come first come first serve. We are trying to get the number of whoever is in charge so we can make a complaint."
3.5,4,"As a swimming beach, this sucks balls: rocky shoreline, mucky and muddy lake bottom, and the place is often crowded with soggy-diapered babies and mariachi-blaring boomboxes. Not recommended!

But the campground part was actually pretty nice! Lots of trees, clean restrooms (no showers), quiet, relaxing, and a short 10-minute hike to the water's edge. It's only a 45-minute drive from Vegas, so this is a great spot for a quick one-or-two night campout."
3.5,4,"in the middle of the desert, you can count on this place and campground for some water and some sunshine. bring your own shade and for the beach area."
3.5,4,"Boulder Beach is what I will refer to in this post. Seems that the campground and the beach are consolidated here. However, the beach is public and accessible to anyone entering the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Flush toilets are available as you enter the Boulder Beach turn off. Down by the water are additional non-flushing toilets, as well. All are well maintained and so is the shoreline. Gulls, occasional ducks and other foul inhabit the water front. Due to the rocky terrain on the shore and in the shallow areas, you MUST WEAR SHOES. Just go to CVS on the way there and pick up some water shoes. This is definitely a swimming beach so don't listen to the tenderfoot complaints of others. You can even go in your tennis shoes to overcome the ouch factor to enjoy a refreshing swim."
3.5,4,"This place is awesome! It makes for some amazing sunsets and great place to go to just get away from the city. 
Great place to take dogs to swim and get some hiking done
Also amazing for photos and picnics! 
Water is a little muddy but if you have ever gone to a lake before you know that's to be expected . And it's quite a bit rocky so brig some shoes u can swim in not flip flops you will lose them. As well as a think blanket to lay on so your not directly on the rocks. 
You can drive up right to the water which is fabulous cause u don't have to take trips with your stuff plush u could hang out in the car if u wanted. But also be aware because you have to drive on rocks so if you have a low car it won't work. If u stay after dark (which I suggest) it will be challenging to drive back to the road on rock so pre warning you
If going brig camera towels if u wanna swim water and food and make a day of it out in the desert. Be sure to stay after dark if your car can handle it because the stars are amazing! All in all we went late and stayed a whole two hours but it was the best time we have had in Vegas since we move here six months ago. Will defiantly do again!!!"
3.5,4,"Had a great experience at this campground. Super clean and well kept campground. Nice fire pits and tables. Relatively quiet area--with some air traffic in the morning (helicopters you could hear and some airplanes going into Las Vegas that you could barely hear). Clean flush toilets and sink that are well lit at night. No animals or bugs when we were there. 
There isn't much to do. Boulder beach is about half a mile down the road and it's a bit of an uphill climb to get back to the campground. 
Only downfall is that it is inside the lake mead national park so you have to pay the entrance fee to the park on top of the campsite fee."
3.5,3,Great campgrounds with shade trees and flushing toilets which are surprisingly clean. Great views of the lake and a few courting doves to make it more peaceful and relaxing. Campfire rings and stone tables at each site with water spigots on each circle. I was surprised to find a spot at 1pm on Easter weekend combined with spring break as well as plenty of others which filled up by the evening. The hosts were kind enough to tell me I couldn't tie anything to a tree but also were quick to help with a extra envelope and advice for my extra days I decided to stay. Would def stay here again since I have a NP Pass and that made it way cheaper. Thanks Boulder for your hospitality!
3.5,3,"We just went for the beach and didn't use the campground, so my review is of that. There were life vests that you could use by the entrance to beach area. The word beach is a little misleading since it's mostly rock. If we had known we may have changed locations or at the very least gotten everyone water shoes. There were bathrooms available close by and plenty of covered picnic areas too. It was pretty quite, so that was nice!"
3.5,4,"Generally a nice quiet campground. The hosts are super nice. Park Rangers patrol frequently. This visit was pretty miserable because of obnoxious drunk kids partying all night. The Ranger came to talk to them, to no avail. We actually cut out trip short because my kids didn't feel safe. 
Really sad that spring break ends early due to inconsiderate 20 something's."
3.5,1,"My review is of the Boulder beach not the campground, campground looked OK. The beach is really quite sad, very rocky and you can see that the water recession has pushed it further away from the original structures. The biggest issue is when one thinks of the beach one thinks of sand, this Beach  is void of sand, very rocky and one is not able to go into the water without sandals. They could easily come and dump a few truck loads of dand as the scenery is quite beautiful. You also have the usual American/Redneck thing of powerboats blasting up and down the water violating the auditory senses. Las Vegas must have huge amounts of tax dollars from gambling but I suppose the usual libertarian mentality of no government services has made this place what it is. Even so one would think some enterprising person could come along and make it into a great beach half an hour from Vegas."
3.5,4,"Lake Mead has always been the place for my friends and I to go fishing or camping. Like many, I've always been apprehensive to get in the water because ive been told that it's ""nasty"" or the water is just straight out ""dirty."" 
I'm not going to lie-- we saw a plastic cup floating around the water and the breeze occasionally brought in some twigs and debris, but it's really not that bad. I am also guilty of thinking that the water here is flat out gross but it really isn't! In fact I keep coming back because one, I just like water in general coming from the Navy and all, and two we just enjoy ourselves here! 

If you are planning on coming here, do invest in a pair of swimming shoes--it looks nice at first but once you get in the water you might end up stepping on a rock the size of your fist.
Also DO NOT bring your pets here! Im an animal lover myself but you can't just be bringing them here. There are signs posted everywhere that it's not allowed! There is a couple that brought  their dog the few times we came here and they did not clean up after it! Just watch your step if  you know what I mean. 

Lastly, it's a great place to go  if you want to ""get away"" and bring your family. It does get busy on the weekends so weekdays are your best bet if one does not like the crowd. It's also pretty close to the picnic table areas! Yay!"
3.5,3,The people we spoke to were fantastic. However it was very confusing to find our site and we didn't know how to check in.  It was very confusing.  Really wish there were showers here!
3.5,4,"This review is for the Group Campsite which we utilized during a Scout Camp out.  I generally find group campsites to be much nicer and the site we got was no exception. 

Plenty of room, close to a bathroom, close to water features, lots of room to park cars and trucks at the edge if the camp site.  There were 5 picnic tables in the area, a few charcoal grills, and vegetation that separates group campsites pretty good for privacy. 

There is a half mile walk from the group campsites to the Lake shoreline."
3.5,4,Nice place to spend the day during summer months in the desert. Get there early to beat the crowd. Bring water shoes.
3.5,4,"This is a review for the beach only.

You can access the beach from the main road by turning by the picnic area. There is ample parking in a rock parking lot. 

You will want to bring a chair for the beach since it is all rocks. You will also need water socks or some type of footwear to go into the water and to walk on the beach since it is all rocks.

The water is nice and you can easily see the bottom."
3.5,5,"With National Park Pass, our stay at pull-thru site 147 was the best primitive RV site thus far. Just $10/day with plenty of tree canopies to shaded our site, the warm wind becomes cool wind through our trailer in an instant. No shower, but toilet and sink are clean, and they were just short walking distance away. Water spigots were scatter throughout the campground within easy stroll distance. Exiting boulder campground to Lakeshore road is less than 2min away. Not every sites here have good shade, just our site was one of the best in Boulder Beach Campground. No direct access to the beach, but with 4wheel drive vehicle, we parked right on Lake Mead shoreline and and spend hours playing with water there."
3.5,4,"So I've got to be honest, I'm not a camper.  Prior to this trip, I'd spent one night in a tent in the last ten years.  However, what do you do when you're a Girl Scout Leader and the other Leader wants to provide the girls with a camping experience?  You camp.

We booked a group site.  Initially, we could not get the weekend that we wanted.  Although the alternative weekend had free entrance in to Lake Mead, which made drop off for the girls easy and free!

Our site was very close to the restroom.  I appreciated the flush toilet and working sinks.  It would have been better if there was soap, which our girls had to carry back and forth.

Nice amount of space, grill, and fire pit.  Four picnic benches.  We didn't need more tables, but it was nice that we brought pop up tents for some shade.

Our next door neighbors were partying pretty late into the evening.  I don't know if they were drinking, but seriously be quiet after 12!

We only saw the ranger once.  

Overall, nice campground in great location."
3.5,4,"I have nothing to base this off of as this was my first camping trip ever. 

Spaces were spacious. They included a painted picnic table enough for 8 people and an adequate fire pit. 

Bathroom facility seemed to be either brand new or recently renovated and was very clean and stocked. Only thing missing was a place to shower. 

Location is right next to lake so you get some pretty awesome views within a tiny walking distance."
3.5,4,"With its sandy beach, palm trees, and clear water Boulder Beach is Magaritaville in the desert. This past Saturday I was wasting away in Magaritaville.

  With the summer temperature turning the desert into an oven, I had to become more creative with my weekly hiking adventure. So, I chose to waste away stress and negativity with a minor hike alongside Boulder Beach. If the temperature became unbearable, I could turn the hike into a swimming adventure.

  Boulder Beach-the Magaritaville in the desert rests on the southwest corner of Lake Mead, which is approximately two miles north of US 93. It is one of the rare places along the Lake Mead shoreline exclusively designated as a beach. From my experience it is a rocky Magaritaville. In my opinion, it is far too rocky to swim in the water without flip flops. It is a relaxing place to stand in the water where a mental shaker of salt dissipates stress. I enjoyed the rare opportunity of standing knee-deep in the exact water that is flowing from the Grand Canyon. I enjoyed looking across at the Western mountainside. On a triple digit day, this was a refreshing way of wasting away my stress.

  Boulder Beach is part of Boulder Beach Campground. This is a spread out section in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The totality of the east portion is a beach connecting Las Vegas Boat Harbor on the south to the Saddle Island area on the north. The west portion is three separate shady areas. The southern area, with its own entrance is a motor trailer campground that includes a store that is open to 5 PM. A country road from area one travels into area two which is a very shady campground that resembles Florida more than Nevada. The country road continues to the third and north area which is a picnic area and ranger station with its own entrance. This is one of my favorite picnic areas in Nevada. It is one of my go-to places to put my phone and mind on airplane mode. If I did not like eating out so much, I would barbecue here. This shaded picnic area with its commanding views overlooking Lake Mead and the soundtrack of birds is so relaxing that I have fallen asleep here. To the east of the picnic area, it is a tolerable distance to the beach. The walk from the picnic area to the beach is where I did the majority of the hiking this past Saturday.

  When the temperature is cool, Boulder Beach makes a nice trailhead for hiking along the River Mountains Loop Trail. My previous review on Boulder Beach and on the Alan Bible Visitor Center discusses hiking in the vicinity of Boulder Beach.

  To some people Boulder Beach is shoreline in the desert. To me, it is Magaritaville in the desert. It is a place for wasting away stress and negativity when the weather is scorching.

The Daniel.S 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 93."
3.5,5,"This place is a literal oasis in the desert! It was cheap, and had a wonderful view. 
It has some really nice showers and bathrooms, and you can tell that the owners take really good care of everything.
At nighttime you can see many many stars, even though it's only thirty minutes away from Las Vegas. Wonderful place!!"
3.5,3,"There are no showers, but the beach is easily accesible, nice spots to stay and plenty of room, fire rings and a picknick table at your service. Toilets are clean! 20$ a night, perfectly fine!"
3.5,5,"Oasis is the best description for this well groomed, well maintained, recycled beach.  If your want to be part of the crowd, take the road from the campground and stay on the white sandy beach. If you are interested in taking the road less traveled, carry your coolers through the ""desert area"". Avoid the snake holes. But when you arrive, there are camp sites already set up from thoughtful American campers. Enjoy the lake area there referred to by the locals as ""poo beach""."
3.5,4,"Great campgrounds with shade trees and flushing toilets which are surprisingly clean. Great views of the lake and a few courting doves to make it more peaceful and relaxing.

Tip, go to the Lake Mead Boat Harbour for a free shower ( Very clean individual showers ), laundry facilities, bathrooms, a decent restaurant and buy a bag of cheap popcorn to feed the fish and ducks! Thanks Boulder for your hospitality!"
3.5,5,This place is relaxing & fun! I took pictures and had fun munching on my personal snacks. Playing my B.B.King extra loud. And just wishing that I could get a southern heap n helping of southern hospitality that my home town Memphis is famous for. So on my next trip I will bring ribs that I slow cook and bbq to perfection. Oh its easy to see I have found a new spot to get away from it all...now to hide it from everyone. Oh that will do nicely. ..like an old episode of inspector gadget this message will self destruct in 2.5 seconds.  Waves my hands what review? No I didn't write a review for this place!
3.5,4,"My first Camping trip in NV was this weekend at Boulder Beach Campground.  I will review with the mindset this is not where I am used to camping and just enjoy it for the fact I was out in nature enjoying probably the last stretch of nice weather we will be having for awhile! 

It is nice to think you can come out here to escape Vegas for a day or two.  Lots of trees and flowering bushes.  The grounds seemed to be well kept and maintained.  There is a small convenience store to buy last minute items open until 5.  It is actually a pretty large campground lots of spaces to choose from some are a bit out in the open and others are hidden behind nice bushes and trees.  They also had spots with tent pads, a raised up square patch that is not full of rocks.

I definitely recommend this place if you are going to make a day of water sports on the lake.  When you are done or feel like taking a break come on back in and eat your lunch or dinner at your spot with you stuff and chill out under the stars and drive home the next day! 

This is kinda a crazy weekend to go camping because you will get whole gamut of people.  There was a group of very loud partiers (don't get me wrong I like to party but in a good way not a crazy way) in a near spot that got a little out of control at one time and the rangers were there within minutes taking care of the situation.

I would go back and now I know the lay of the land would know where I would prefer to stay next time."
3.5,5,"This is a beautiful area for winter camping-full hook-ups so that you can use your heater at night and gorgeous views of Lake Mead and the surrounding desert mountains. You can easily walk down to the beach and two marinas, both with restaurants and small shops. We will definitely go here again and again. Boulder City, NV is nearby with lots of fun antique shops, the Boulder Dam Brewery, the Coffee Cup Restaurant, and other fun restaurants in the cute downtown area. We went in our fifth wheel and there was plenty of room to get in and out, we also weren't smashed up against our neighbors, plenty of room for our slide outs."
3.5,1,"This place is sadly in really poor conditions. Some reviews describe an oasis, nothing even close. Camp is in horrible conditions. Camp workers are rude and condescending (not referring to Rangers.the Rangers were nice and professional). Camp sites are so close to each other that you can hear your neighbors snore.

If you are looking for a quiet camping ground this one is not it. Been here many times and it's very noisy. Camp sites being so close to each other does not help one bit. Don't complain that neighbors are up till 1am with their music. Good luck."
3.5,2,"I used to come here back in the day with my high school friends, and from back when this place used to be a lot cleaner. I'm disappointed to see the park rangers do not enforce more rules regarding people picking up after themselves or offering special bins to dispose of recyclables and garbage, because there were leftover shoes, broken bottles, and remnants of broken toys and other objects littering the shoreline. They really let themselves go with the beach part, and I really hope they decide to fix things up again.  

I'm not sure if it was a windy day or something else, but there was an absolute *horrible* smell coming from the water. It might have been the water treatment plant I'm hearing so much about, or the fact that the lake is used for more purposes than recreation (sorry guys!) My friend and I only stayed for about 30 minutes at the most because she couldn't stand the smell and was beginning to be sickened by it. I don't remember this place having a smell like it did, but it really turned off the entire experience for us (seeing as how this was my friend's first time here, it wasn't a great first impression for her and I felt bad). 

Besides from that, you might want to grab a pair of water shoes, and lots of water to drink. The shoreline and shallow areas of the lake are very rocky, and temperatures can get up past 112 degrees in the summers. The good thing is there's plenty of space to park out here, seeing as Boulder Beach isn't as crowded as it used to be."
3.5,5,"Everything that you have read about this campground being a literal oasis in the desert is Gospel of Paul. We spent 24 hours at this camp after realizing the sad reality (water recession) as to why a majority of the other campgrounds were ghost towns.

My girlfriend and I camped at this facility on a Saturday after deciding to move on from Callville Bay Campground (which is nice, as well) as a result of a waterfront that was, sadly, no where to be found. We stumbled over at about 8:00AM and there were plenty of plots left despite our concern of a first come, first serve campground on a Saturday morning. We found a wonderful spot (120) with a view of the water and plenty of shade from the 105 degree sun.

I see in the prior reviews that there are a lot of posts about the beach not being dog friendly, but I want you to know that the camp itself is very dog friendly, and you can go to the private events beach just 200 yards down from the main beach that the pup can run free until their little heart figuratively explodes with joy.

I'll be frequenting this campground as both a getaway, but I would absolutely consider this a forever home... you know, if I lived in my tent full-time.

Infamous one-sentence review of Boulder Beach Campground?
""This place needs no popping-the-tent innuendos to entice you call it temporary home"""
3.5,2,"The beach itself is kind of gross. I really wanted to love it but... no. It's too rocky, there's weird algae and moss, dog crap, all kinds of rubbish everywhere and we even found dead birds by the beach. I don't know how some people can go swimming in there, even the thought of it makes me gag. I'd probably shower in chlorine afterwards.

Good pokemon hunting spot though, but not by the actual beach but on the camgrounds... IF you can get internet to work. My LTE barely worked."
4.5,5,Very nice park.  Beautiful landscaping and view of Mead Lake.  You can walk to downtown.  Management is excellent and very responsive to any needs.  Amenities are top notch.  On occasion you may see the sheep behind the park in the canyon.
4.5,4,"Great place and would definitely stay there again.  You cannot access the internet from your RV so, that keeps it from receiving a 5 star rating.  Dealing with Brent and Spencer was fantastic.  Great communication and were always available to answer questions or help in anyway. Nice pool and spa, clean and well maintained bathrooms and plenty of parking. 5 minutes from Lake Mead."

Also enjoy the heated pool and spa year round."

4.5,4,Very nice vacation place to go to I had a great time the last time I went in May I end up going to Vegas and get married very nice and quiet
4.5,5,"Great customer service. This was my first time at this repair shop. I took my Nissan in yesterday to get a routine oil change and have my tires rotated. I made an appointment the day before for 11:30 and by 11:45 my car was up on the rack. They did a great job of checking all the fluids, changing the oil and rotating the tires as promised. They didn't try to sell me anything, which was nice.  As a woman, I've always been very wary of car repair places. A lot of these places take advantage of women and we wind up paying more than we should. I didn't get that sense with this place. It was clean, they were friendly, they explained everything, and they were quick. Good experience. 

It was confirmed today that they really do take great pains to give excellent customer service. When I got home yesterday after the tires were rotated, I noticed that one of my hubcaps was missing. I swung by this morning to see if it had fallen off in the parking lot. The owner was there and he arranged for me to get the hubcaps replaced no charge. I tried to pay for part of it and he was very firm that this was on him. I own a business and I understand that sometimes you can't help what your employees do, no matter how much you train them. So I admire a company that understands if something goes wrong, you do what you can to fix it. No one is perfect, but being willing to look for a solution is a very important part of customer service. 

I understand this because I teach it... I've been a customer service trainer for decades. This experience has become my newest great example of how to treat your customers. Thanks guys!"
4.5,1,"Is there an honest car mechanic out there? Not sure you will find one at Brake Masters on Cave Creek in Phoenix. In early July my car was bucking or hesitating so I brought it to Brake Masters because I had just had an oil change done there a few days previous. They performed a diagnostic test in which they found cylinder 6 misfiring and to fix this suggested a fuel injection service. So I paid $119.99 plus tax $136.31 out the door. Tech reported PCM update did not take and Dave recommended bringing it to dealership. Which I did. I paid dealership $200  and car is still bucking/hesitating. So, I bring it back to Brake Masters. Now cylinder 6 ignition coil was found to be bad. But wasn't that what the diagnostic test showed in early July. On July 20, 2016,  I paid  $231.54 to have cylinder 6 ignition coil replaced. After this repair car was still hesitating AND it smelled like fuel in the car so I brought it back another time. This time for no charge he put in something to clean the fuel and recommended a $800 repair to replace the fuel injection system. When I complained that the car seems worse than it was before any repairs, he offered to put the $200 I spent on coil repair toward injection system repair. He said he wasn't surprised at the fuel smell and explained it somehow in mechanic lingo. At this point I brought it to a neighborhood mechanic because I am feeling I am falling down an expensive rabbit hole. My mechanic found that ignition coil 6 was bad and had to replace it along with a spark plug. He also noted that ignition coil #2 looked newer than all the others which are original parts. Now the car is not hesitating or bucking and NO fuel smell. Yay! Then I headed over to Brake Masters. If Brake Masters would have done repair correctly I would not have had to spend so much time and money on this. I showed Dave the receipts, parts and Dave said he could only give back half of my money. I will have to go back in AGAIN tomorrow morning to speak with Mike because he is the only one authorized to issue a credit for the full amount. Either the repair was done incorrectly or dishonestly with the intent of me spending even more money. I will go back in tomorrow and then decide if there is an honest mechanic at Brake Masters on Cave Creek in Phoenix. I will update this post soon..."
4.5,4,"Just finished with my oil change and wanted to give a quick Yelp review for the great service I received and witnessed  at this location. Office is clean offering complementary coffee, water bottles, and promotional items. Brake Masters offer different specials so make sure you call and don't wait for a coupon to come in the mail! This location seems very honest, and reliable. My service had no issues, as I sat and waited for my oil change a customer came in and requested her brakes to be checked because a friend of hers told her it seemed something might be wrong. Break Masters looked them over and told her the brakes were in fine condition and she could pick up her car without any charge. I felt this was commendable service because they could of told her differently!"
4.5,5,"Brought my car in for my front brakes and I've had a lot of brake services at other facilities (not brake masters), and they replaced the pads, resurfaced the rotors, and they bled the brakes and it feels like it's a brand new car from the dealer, which I find is rare for after market brake shops. The customer service was great and my breaks don't make any sounds and feel great. I would definitely bring my car back again and recommend this location to everyone! Very professional also!"
4.5,1,"The customer service here is awful.  Rude and unprofessional. I have never stood so long waiting to be acknowledged in my life.  Also, the people that are working there come inside and interrupt conversations like they don't even notice you are there. The turnaround time for the work is okay and the work seems to be average, but I'll never set foot here again or recommend this location to anyone (that I like). There are plenty of similarly priced placed with similar turnaround that manage more bedside manner. A tip to the manager - greet your customers with a ""Hi"" or ""Hello"" and not ""$286.11"" or whatever inflated sum you're charging.  Rude beyond measure."
4.5,5,"I dont know if their business ethics have changed but i brought in my car and Steve Valentine (previous manager) took a look at my car and determined what the problem was by ear and a simple process of elimination with my vehicle's fuel injectors and spark plugs.  Within 2 minutes he knew what it was, went out of the way to issue out the repair for the vehicle when the shop was about to close and had me out of there by the end of the day and ready to go to work the next day.  He saved my a**.  I recently bough another vehicle and had that looked at for free, mechanic took for a drive, looked at the engine, removed the tires to check on the brakes, fluids, etc.   I told the manager Steve Valentine that i totally appreciate what he did, and thats how you keep customers, since now there is only one place i will take my car in for a checkup and that is this Brake Masters.  The manager is now someone else and they did a straightforward welding work on a harness underneath the vehicle, pretty standard price, no complaints."
4.5,4,"Update on the 8/25/16 post. Mike at Brake Masters made it right and refunded the money for incorrectly installed ignition coil and the fuel injection service. When I arrived in the morning an envelope with a letter apologizing for the mistake, a check, and two free oil changes were ready for me to pick up. Needless to say, relieved he made it right and I will consider it an honest mistake."
4.5,5,"First time at this location and I will definitely be back! It was so convenient to be able to book an appointment days in advance, pull right up, get the oil changed, pay the special price, and be out within 30 minutes. David was very nice and informative. And they had free Wi-Fi for their guests."
4.5,5,I can't say enough great things about this place and the guys who work here. I came in to this location in a panic with my brake lights not working and they addressed my issues quickly and with the utmost care and professionalism. They definitely made us customers for life! I highly recommend Dave and his crew at this Brake Masters location on Bell and Cave Creek Road!
4.5,5,"Dave was awesome!! I had a 3+ hour wait for a Radiator replacement and he ordered an uber so I could go have lunch and be back when the car was ready! He was friendly and offered incredible Customer Service. In the time I was there I saw several interactions with repeat clients, and everyone was so genuine and you could tell they really enjoy their services there and the warm environment that Dave helps create!! You won't be disappointed if you take your vehicle here!! Pet friendly too, love that!"
4.5,1,"I've used Brake Masters for oil changes for over 5 years and recently moved to a new area. I brought my car in to get an oil change at this location and they don't use the brand oil (Valvoline) the company advertises. I even asked before I got the oil change if they use Valvoline brand oil because I want to use the same oil every time, which any mechanic will recommend you do. I later watched the mechanic pour a different brand of oil in my car. When I brought it up to the guy up front he told me they could fix the problem in the morning because they were closing soon and would have needed to go buy the oil they actually advertise. I would have rather gotten my oil changed somewhere else the next day then deal with this nonsense. I'll make sure to go to another Brake Masters next time."
4.5,5,"This my favorite auto shop, friendly and will help with any issues. David us very curtious with all customers and a full bucket of knowledge bolts anything automotive."
4.5,5,"Being a female and getting my car fixed has always been the bane of my existence. I am usually faced with con artist mechanics who act like my driving home could result in a cataclysmic event if I don't fix x,y,and z. 

Visiting this location was a breath of fresh air. I was treated so well (most phenomenal customer service) and was provided info without the fear tactics. The owner/manager even provided an oil change because my ""wait was long"" (honestly it was a busy Saturday and I thought he went above and beyond by doing so).

I am extremely loyal after one visit and will certainly return!"
4.5,5,"Totally recommend this place 100% Dave was amazing , not only was he honest he also goes above and beyond for his customers. My car was in need of two repais and I only had the budget for one of them, out if the kindness of his heart he help me with the second repair at no cost. People like him are hard to find. Trust me when I tell you this is the place to go."
4.5,5,My brakes needed to be replaced as did my A/C unit. I was a little skeptical at first as my car dealership (Jeep) told me it was going to cost me a ton of money that was way out of my price range. I decided to check the areas around town before making my final decision of who to use and this shop was more than fair. Mike and Dave are incredibly polite and helpful. They truly care about their customers. I will be back for all my car needs.
4.5,5,"I can't believe I haven't written a review before now but better late than never!!!  Dave & all the staff at this location are ridiculously good and I trust them 100% with all of my car maintenance and repair needs.  Even after I moved a considerable distance from their shop, I will drive out of my way to have them take a look at my car anytime I have any concerns for several years now.  Today I had a scary grinding noise going on with my brakes so I called them.  They said to bring it by as soon as I could.  I got to their shop at 4:30 PM and planned on leaving my car there overnight as they were closing within an hour.  I took a Lyft ride to a rental car company nearby.  Before I could even finish the paperwork, Dave called to say that they would be able to repair my car and fix the brakes before they closed the shop at 5:30pm.  I was able to cancel my rental car and take a Lyft ride back to the shop.  Not only did I drive away in my car that night but they save me the hassle of having to deal with the rental car the next day.  This has been consistent with all of my experiences with them. I am always left feeling taken care of and that I am never over paying for the services that I truly need.  They are very fair in their pricing and 100% trustworthy to do quality work at reasonable prices."
4.5,5,Great service! My wife has been bringing her car here for years. I had an issue with my brakes and Dave had me in and out within a few hours! I'll be back for sure with any future car problems or maintenance.
4.5,5,"I recently moved from Tucson where I used to go to a break masters there for oil change, and they were very honest in their service. After moving, I looked online, and I found this place with great reviews, so I went there on a Saturday afternoon. The place was really busy and there were no availabilities. After talking to Dave, the manager, he was able to squeeze me in his schedule and asked me to come by in an hour. I came back in less than an hour, and they started working on the oil change, and they finished the service in less than half an hour! I was very impressed by the great and timely service, and I will definitely come back again.I drove to the furthest place because of the reviews and was not disappointed. Highly recommend this place."
4.5,5,"Doyle is hands down just a great person. I recently moved to valley from northern AZ and my car wouldn't start I had it towed in on a Saturday and he was super busy. However, he new I needed my car by Monday so I could get to work. Not even an hour and he called me saying it was ready. It was something minor and he didn't even charge me for it. I have always loved brake masters and this most recent visit was awesome. I left there with tears of joy. As a young 21 year old trying to start my life this kindness really had an impact. I will continue to go to Doyle. Come here if you want a great experience. I'd give a million stars if I could. Great company with great people."
4.5,5,"These guys are great!  We came in on a Thursday afternoon after 4:00 pm with slightly squeaky brakes. Even though they closed in about an hour they got us right in.  They took it for a test drive and put it up on the rack before we even noticed, they were so efficient.  They diagnosed our brakes quickly and didn't try to oversell us.   We needed a front brake job but they said our rear brakes were fine.  We appreciated their honesty so much.  They had to order in a part for our brakes and our brake job was done the next day.  Dave, the manager, really worked hard for us to get the part we needed quickly.  Thank you Dave!  Everyone we encountered - they all were amazing.  These guys really know their stuff.  This Brake Masters has a life-long customer in us for the way they treated us and we are forever grateful.  We will be recommending them to our friends.  Thanks Brake Masters!"
4.5,1,They stripped the threads on my new oil pan. They were the first ones to touch it. No one else could have done it. They claimed it was that way already but it was new and IF it was stripped so badly if it was already that way before I brought it in it would have leaked oil all over my driveway and I have no oil left in the car. Which wasn't the case it was new. When I confronted them on this they denied any wrong doing and said they had to replace the oil pan at a cost of nearly  $500 or I'd have to get the car towed off their lot since it would no longer hold oil! I had my car towed and fixed at half the cost. Their dishonesty was shocking even after I presented them the proff of their wrong doing.
4.5,5,"Let me start off with saying I've never written a review for Yelp in my life. With that being said I am thrilled to give this place a five star review. If there was an option for six stars I would give it a sixth star. From the moment I walked into the shop I felt like I was in great hands with Dave the owner. You can tell that he really cares about his customers. He is more than fair with pricing and can take care of all your car's needs. I love that everybody who walked in was treated like a regular. Dave even knew everybody's name, just like CHEERS! I will never take my car to another shop again, can't wait to return!"
4.5,5,Dave is an amazing manager with great customer service:) Always willing to take care of you. Definitely will recommend all my family and friends to this location only:)
4.5,5,"It has been two years since my review. I want to add a couple of comments. First, if I could give SIX stars I would. It is so rare these days to find conscious, caring customer service. You can find it at Brakemasters on Cave Creek Road in Phoenix.

~ First, they took my car in immediately. 
~ They offer you cold water and a cool place to wait.
~ WiFi is available if you have to wait. 
~ The staff is friendly and informative. And they actually explain things to you. They aren't trying to sell you something, they genuinely care. 

And then -- there's JAKE. Mike (owner) If you are reading this, I hope you are taking very good care of Jake. I know a lot of people his age. He is one special guy. He has perhaps the ONE thing every employer needs in their staff: Resourcefulness. He pays attention, he comes up with solutions, he explains things, and he really understands what the word ""Service"" means in Customer Service. I was very impressed this morning when I went in for a simple oil change. 

Right as I was ready to leave, a humongous tow truck started backing into the parking lot with a street sweeper on the back of his trailer. He nearly took out your utility box, and was not managing backing in very well. I was stuck in the parking lot by the new building. Jake came out, told me it might be awhile and said I should wait in the air conditioning. He then proceeded to come up with a solution. When it looked like that truck wasn't going anywhere soon, Jake figured out he could move a few things and I could get my car out through the bays. He cleared the cars and boxes, took my car keys, and drove through the bays to the other side. I was on my way. 

Paying attention, coming up with solutions, being considerate and caring... man, those things are hard to come by in this day and age. Please thank Jake for me as well as the rest of your team. It was a great experience. That's why I love your shop and trust your team to take care of me!"
4.5,1,"Called around to a few brake shops and ended up
Booking an appointment with Brake Masters due to the price I was quoted for changing the brake pads on my wife's highlander (134.00+tax) which I thought was a great deal. I show up Monday and drop my wife's car off and am told it will be about an hour. 15 min later I get a call saying it's due for a flush of the brakes and needs all new pads. I knew it needed pads (that's why I made the appointment) I declined the flush and then was told the front brakes would be 134.00 and the back 164.00. I told them I was told it would be 134.00 for all brake pads, the employee proceeded to tell me that is the special but only for the fronts. I was very frustrated and felt scammed and mislead. I told them to put my tires back on I'm coming to pick it up, once I got there the employee just handed me my keys (did not say a word) and I walked out.  I took it to another shop and it was done for 150.00!
Beware of this place!"
4.5,5,This place is great. The people are so trustworthy and they know what they're talking about. I've been to places where they have taken advantage of me because I don't know a lot about cars. I feel very confident in their work and trust them completely. I will be back!
4.5,5,"Mike and Dave are wonderful. This shop is amazing. They truly go out of their way to make sure everything is perfect. Excellent customer service. I cannot say enough great things about this place. Thank you so much Brake Masters on Cave Creek Rd, I will be back."
4.5,5,I came to get my brakes checked at brake master the person at the front desk was polite straight forward and very friendly then explained to me what I needed to have done. He gave me a great price and guaranteed his product I definitely recommend this location.
4.5,5,"A+ They were more than fair with my mother, unlike most other shops that will try to take advantage of a helpless old lady!"
4.5,5,Mike and Dave were great! They made sure to answer any questions I had and were very friendly! There is also a great coffee station in the waiting area
4.5,5,"Super Dave at Brake Masters is the best! My front brakes were squeaking. I was afraid of being ripped off so I went on Yelp to see if I could find an honest place to take my car to. I saw all the good reviews for the Brake Masters location on Cave Creek and Bell. I took my car in and was greeted by Dave. He took care of me right away. He showed me what was wrong with my car and gave me a sweet deal via coupon. I only paid $134 total for replacing my front brakes. I have other repairs that are needing to be done and I will FOR SURE return to Super Dave's Brake Masters. (Yes, Super Dave)."
4.5,5,Great service! Dave and mike are both great. My car was done quickly and is running perfectly. Love this place!!! Will definitely be going back. Highly recommend.
4.5,4,"Stopped in to get my oil changed today, no waiting, and it was 3  PM on a saturday. Adrian, the manager went back and worked on my car. He was very knowledgeable, and showed me exactly the state various components were in. He figured out why my AC wasn't working (the last mechanic had not plugged the radiator fan back in after working on it) also, replaced some clips for heat shields at no cost. I wish they were less expensive, but the service I got today was excellent."
4.5,5,Best customer service! for even better service  ask for Dave he is awesome! He toke care of my car and showed me exactly what was wrong they don't play when it comes to knowing cars they get you in and out as fast as possible Strongly recommend this place.
4.5,5,"I went to the dealer for my warranty covered oil change. I asked them to look at my brakes because they were squeaking. I was told I needed both front and rear brakes for $470. I believed them because why would they lie? 
I then went to Brake Masters where they told me I only needed front brakes, that my back brakes were fine. I was able to get lifetime front brakes for a third of the cost of what I would've paid at the dealership (especially since I didn't need the back brakes), and they were quick! 

I really appreciate the honesty and will definitely be back for whatever I need next! I will not listen to the dealership again."
4.5,5,This place goes above and beyond!!! They are so considerate and polite. The customer service here is perfect. I had an oil leak and stopped in on my way up north. They got it fixed ASAP. I expected a long wait and was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't even seem like you are waiting for long because the employees are so personable and easy to talk to. Also priced very fair. Always recommend this place.
4.5,5,"Brake Masters is awesome!  I would recommend them to anyone looking to get quality work done to their car.  I will never go to the dealership again after visiting Brake Masters on Cave Creek Road in Phoenix.  Dave is very friendly, knowledgeable, and honest.  Their prices are reasonable and they don't sell you something you don't need.  I got my front brakes and rotors done immediately as a walk-in customer.  All of the other customers were friendly and our conversations made the wait time go by really quickly.  It was truly a pleasure! They have my business from now on! Thank you so much Dave for your outstanding customer service!  See you soon."
4.5,5,"Woke up to my car not starting today, was able to jump it and bring it here. I was greeted with welcoming arms and such friendly service! Dave and Mike want the best for their customers and won't hassle you with extra stuff. And they gave me a free oil change coupon for my birthday! Super great guys and I am happy to live right down the street!"
4.5,5,The first time I stopped in because I wasn't sure if I needed new brakes and Doyle took care of me. Turned out I didn't need them. So I went there today for my oil change and I got the same great service! Doyle is super nice and they were super fast! To top it all off I was a walk in and they got me right in!
4.5,5,Awesome same day service! Very friendly and personal staff replaced front and back brakes on my Altima including back rotors for very reasonable cost. Great job guys!
4.5,5,These guys are awesome! I came here before for an oil change and they were great. They never tried to bs me and were friendly so I came back today for another oil change. I didn't have an appointment and I accidentally showed up before they opened but they were happy to start my oil change anyway. The guys that worked there were super friendly and chatted with me about various topics. They noticed my military plates so we talked a lot about the navy. They thanked me for my service numerous times and even gave me a free oil change! We need more automotive shops like this one! Thanks again guys!
4.5,5,We got our oil changed and they were really nice and kind and the gentleman in the office was vary kind and we had a great time well we where waiting the office was vary clean and he helped me find a phone number for upholstery for my car
4.5,5,"Wow!!!! 

Ok these guys live up to their hype and so much more!!!! I was told by my body shop I needed to get a brake job - and was referred to brake masters. They were significantly less expensive than other shops I had received quotes from. They didn't try to rake me across the coals, just fix the problem and move on.

While I was waiting, I heard the way they treated other customers. An older lady came in, as soon as she walked in the door they called for someone to drive her home. I thought - wow! She's getting the VIP treatment... she must know some one. Nope! That's just how they are. I over heard the manager going over an inspection with another client telling him what needs to be done immediately, what will need to be repaired in the upcoming months, what was no concern and why. Again, I was blown away by how professional and compassionate the service was. I felt like everyone was treated like family!  I don't know if this is a faith based company - but they definitely follow the golden rule of loving your neighbor as yourself - maybe even better!"
3,5,"We have been using Davenport Diesel for a couple of years now, and we have been happy with them. I am surprised by some of the reviews posted here. Steve has always been professional to us, and he is knowledgeable too. We have multiple trucks in our fleet and I have an invoice on my desk I am getting ready to pay right now. I would recommend Steve at Davenport. 
Mike Riggs General Manager Progressive Hardscapes."
3,1,"The owner Steve says and promises anything you want to hear. But, he is not truthful and over estimates his capability. Once tore down you are at his mercy for completion of job in timely manner. He has a dirty, cluttered, one stall shop. The rest of the work is done out in the back in gravel RV parking area. He is under staffed, unorganized and poorly managed.
He charged me for a job he couldn't complete correctly. I had another shop fix his mess. When presented with the bill he refused to pay it. He was rude, avoided phone calls, and when confronted about this and an overcharge on my bill he told me to F off and hung up. 
I would never recommend this shop to anyone."
3,1,I would not take my rig to these people . They were non professional and rude the owner Stephen was disrespectful and the phone answerer Michael was also condescending and rude. And acted as  if I knew nothing of what I was talking about. I was given a price to run over head (valve adjustment)and do an oil change. and was given one price but when work was done I was told it was a totally different price than what was originally quoted almost 300 dollars more for missing bolts and broken this and that .I WOULD RECCOMEND ANYONE TO TAKE THERE BUISNESS ELSEWHERE unless  u want 2 be charged up and over what was originally quoted. a very very non respectable way to run a business
3,5,"To whom it may concern if you are in need of a really good,honest,dependable,no hidden surprises for Diesel-Pusher RV repairs in Phoenix ,Az area I would highly recommend Steve Davenport and his crew as people who ""Do as they say they'll do and in timely,professional manner at a fair,non gouging manner."" I have had the need for their services several times in past couple of years and have been very satisfied with their willingness to excell and make problems go away...a service and quality that is desperately needed in this area.If needed they will make ""House Calls 'also.Shane and George are great mechanics as well as is  the owner,Steve,I would highly recommend you contact them if only for routine service...you will not regret using them... a great find for RV repairs and a pleasure to deal with! Steve I have found to be a Straight-Shooter,a breath of fresh air!"
4.5,5,"wow turn back the clock!! didn't think people like this still existed! Father Son Shop. Both Extremely knowledgeable at repairing Your Car & NOT at Salesmanship!! what a relief to find Honest People in this field. I have taken My Fleet of service trucks to them as well as my personal vehicles and will continue to do so as well as HIGHLY RECOMMEND Them! if you're looking for honest knowledgeable Repairs to your car, truck or Tank Look No Further these are the guys for you!!"
4.5,5,What this place lacks in personality they more than make up in great work and fair prices. Got a quote for $300 and Chuck got the job done with extra parts for $230! Dropped my car off at 4 pm and it was done 9am the next day. Cannot recommend this place enough.
4.5,5,Chuck is an encyclopedia of knowledge with repairing vehicles. He is patient and let me show him my truck from top to bottom. He save me hundreds of dollars from another estimate when I only needed a tune up.
4.5,5,"Chuck and his son Josh are the best mechanics you will ever find.  When they work on your car they stand behind their work.  For a about a year I thought they were a little too far away from my home so I used another repair shop, and I am so sorry that I wasted good money on another shop that did not stand behind their work.  I decided that even thought I have to drive a half hour in both directions, that it is worth it to have a mechanic who is honest and good at what he does.  I promise you if you bring your car into Auto Repair Clinic you will be satisfied with the work that is done.  Auto repair clinic has been repairing my car for 15 years if not more.  I have never been disappointed with the quality of work and you won't either.  Excellent trustworthy business."
4.5,5,Thanks Chuck your the best. You guys have been taking care of my 4 cars for 10 years...
4.5,1,"My girlfriend took her car in to get brake pads done. A couple days later we started hearing a awful noise coming from the wheels. We took it in to have them look at it. Apparently they forgot to tighten something all the way. They ""fixed"" their mistake but the sound started up again. So she took it back in and they ""fixed"" their other mistake. I'm just glad the wheel didn't come flying off while she was driving with her kids in the car. Dangerous and ignorant mistake. Will not be coming back."
4.5,5,"I have gone here two times, and both times Chuck (the owner) and his son have treated me so well.  They are 'old school' in the best sense of the phrase - they took care of my cars' problems in a professional and prompt way.  Also, they did not try to up-sell or cross-sell me in any way.  They just fixed what was wrong, and, like the intelligent, conscientious people they are, they made sure it was fixed correctly.  They explained everything they did, and gave me a great sense of confidence that my cars have been serviced properly.  

I felt that the prices they charged were very fair, and was happy to pay it.  It's such a nice thing to feel that I'm getting such a good value for their service.

With these guys, I really get the feeling that I've got my own personal mechanic."
4.5,5,They were able to match the price from another auto repair clinic.
4,5,"I have an '86 Dodge convertible that needs exhaust repairs. They were unable to find parts for a vehicle of this age, but didn't charge me for doing the inspection/diagnosis. They were friendly and talked me through exactly what the vehicle needed."
4,2,"The customer service here is poor, and this business does not exercise proper security practices in my opinion. Last week I went to pick up my vehicle from repair just before 5pm, and despite that I was the only one in the waiting area, it took the front desk clerk more than 10 minutes to even acknowledge me! He made me wait, taking phone call after phone call in another room.  While alone at the front counter in the waiting area, I noticed that the keys for all the ready vehicles in their parking lot (including my own) were right there next to me on the countertop, along with the paperwork indicating which keys went to which cars.  It would have been easy for anyone to walk in off busy 32nd street, grab keys off the unattended front counter and steal vehicles right out of their own parking lot in less than a minute.They did fix the problem with my coolant system, but I think this shop is overpriced on top of their other problems. So I'll look elsewhere next time my car needs service."
4,5,"I have complete confidence with this shop. Super knowledgeable and were quick and friendly.

I took my truck to them for a second opinion and they found that the ""recommendations"" from the other shop were completely untrue.

I saved over $700 by having them do the work and not the first overpriced shop."
4,5,Trustworthy. Thorough. Dependable. Tucked on the corner of 32nd Street and Oak this longtime Central Phoenix repair shop has been my go-to for about 4 years. They get to know their customers and the cars they drive and never ever upsell. If you don't really need a repair they'll tell you it can wait. They'll give you a ride to work and pick you up when your vehicle is done. These are good people who do good work for an honest rate.
4,5,"The folks at Dean's are great--honest and helpful. I've been going there for a few years now, and on multiple occasions, I've been pleasantly surprised by their customer service and quick, reasonably priced repairs. If you're in the market for a mechanic you can trust, give Dean's a shot. You won't be disappointed."
4,5,"These guys are my new best friend.  Bobby saved me $4,000 (yes!) on a Honda repair by talking to a guy he knows at Showcase who he can actually trust. As it turns out, Honda had extended the warranty on the hybrid battery and we got in a month before the period ended. Would I trust anyone else at Showcase to point this out? No. And I thank Bobby for the referral.  Dean's Auto is getting my business."
4,1,We took our Toyota Prius into Deans to get a head gasket job done. We were quoted about a week turnaround. After about a week we called to get an update but the service writer couldnt tell us anything. Day after day after day of unanswered calls we found out that the car was never even started on. We picked it up after about 2 weeks with nothing done. Thanks for a big waste of our time Deans Auto repair.
4,5,"After driving around with the ""check engine""and the ""tire pressure low"" lights on my dash for way too long, I decided that it was finally time to give my car a little TLC...

My husband made a phone call to see if Dean's was open on the MLK holiday and confirmed that they were indeed open.  I drove my car there just before 1pm and within hours, they had taken a look and fixed everything that needed fixing... They also shared some additional suggestions for down the road.  We were pleased to hear that my car would be ready for pick-up around 4pm.

We found everyone we interacted with at Dean's to be friendly and knowledgeable... no shady upsells here!  The quick turnaround was super appreciated and the price didn't seem unfair.

I'd definitely return to Dean's for future auto repair needs or request a quote from them if deciding where to take your business.  Thanks Joe, Joseph, and the rest of the team!"
4,4,"I went to Dean's Auto Repair for a 2nd opinion on my car. I had two areas I was told needed repair. The second was quite expensive to fix, that is why I saught a second opinion. I am so Happy I did.  Dean's did the check and found one area needed fixed and repaired it at a reasonable price. The second and most expensive, was not a problem. Thank you so much for Honest and Good Service. I know I will be taking my car back there for all my repairs.  They have great Oil Change prices and a percentage off your service for referring a friend. All around great family feel place."
4,5,"Excellent service! I called for an oil change and they helped me same day! That's all I went in for, they were busy and had the place packed on cars they were working on and still they were quick and efficient! They even went as far as changing my air filter for free, he let me know mine was out dated and I went down to the nearest O'Riley, came back and got it changed for free. They were friendly and inviting. Definitely would recommend this home grown place over a big name shop any day"
4,3,"So, after writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau regarding my poor experience with Dean's Auto Repair, I received a phone call from the owner. This was very welcome considering I did not expect to ever hear from them. We spoke for about 15 minutes, and had a very good and productive conversation.

He apologized profusely, and offered what I found to be a rather good and reasonable explanation for some of the issues I was having. Of course, and I told him this, had someone taken the extra few minutes to explain them at that time, we wouldn't be having this conversation. He understood.

At the end of the day, I was impressed by the honest, concerned response from Mr. McMaster. I believed him when he told me that he appreciated me getting his attention with the BBB letter, and that he was going to be making some changes that would aid in avoiding these kinds of issues in the future.

Additionally, he offered me a coupon for a free oil change. I still have not decided if I will use it, but given the owner's stated commitment to improvement, I will likely give them the opportunity to show me that."
4,1,"Do not go to DEANS auto repair unless you want to waste half your day and receive a bill you pay to get your car back that is a poor opinion of  what needs to be repaired.  What a joke this place has the b**** to charge $135 to open the hood for a few minutes and sit on the car for an hour and call you back to say you need to clean out your gas lines, and that will be $445.  After you pay the 135 for diagnosing nothing, we will subtract that from the $445, what a deal.  I went there to fix the problem and I was specific at what was wrong, so it was a shock to find out they did nothing.  They could have been honest and said it will cost you $135 for us to just look at it and then you can decide if you want to gamble with us actually doing any work.  I believe they are crooks.   Never will I go to Deans auto joke."
4,5,"Brand new to AZ, the process of finding a new mechanic can be a little slice of hell. Luckily, I found Dean's on Yelp and the three good reviews had me heading over there to figure out what was wrong with my gas tank and gas gauge. Right away over the phone, I was given the rundown that the estimate is free and they would even shuttle me back to my place while the process unfolded. When I arrived at Dean's, there were several older women waiting for their cars to be fixed and they were telling me that this place has been around for over 50 years and they have been bringing their cars in for decades to get fixed which was comforting. There are photos on the wall of years gone past and that says they have been doing something right. As for my car, Grant found a way to get into my tank through the trunk saving several hours in labor costs and also identified other parts I needed as he figured out my problem. My car was bought used so i didn't know it needed a new battery and fuel filter, which I am glad they discovered. I was kept mostly informed of the timetable for my repairs and even though my vehicle had the worst case scenario (Fuel pump), it was easy to be impressed with the detail-oriented mechanics (calling all over for best price on parts and breaking car talk down to the basics), friendly front-desk people and long-time customers who keep coming back which now includes me."
4,5,I have heard about Dean's from several friends as well as people I work with and the company I work for go there to service our vehicles. I am able to drop it off and get a oil change come back and they make sure my car is in the best shape and I leave with a great running car with new oil and a new attitude! Thanks to everyone at Deans Auto for the amazing work and taking care of my car!
4,5,"Now I'm a woman who doesn't know a thing about cars except when a light keeps coming on, that I better get it checked out,) I just moved to the east side/central phoenix from Goodyear. I knew the mechanics on the west side for years and just was recently told even by the cars dealership, that my repairs were a minimum of $750 and the other was $900.  Fed up and taking a shot at a street sign, stopped at Deans Auto Repair and waited for the assaulting of charges BUT NOT DEANS AUTO REPAIR!!!
What a refreshing change!! They called me and said it was fixed and the best part.!  No charge! All it needed was a bolt to be tightened!! Now , in that moment they made a lifetime customer!  Two other places I used for years were going to charge me 10's and Deans didn't charge me a thing! What got me, is they could of! I didn't even walk in with a man to intimidate them into being honest. They did it on their own because basically they rock! Thanks Lee and Grant!"
4,5,"Finally, an auto repair shop that I can trust! I have been taking my car here for a while based on a recommendation I received. I always feel confident that they are being honest with me and I always receive excellent service. It doesn't  hurt that they leave a piece of candy in my car when I pick it up :-)!"
4,1,"TL;DR - Owner and employee offer not even a modicum of customer service. A maintenance service was performed on my car without my knowledge or consent. The owner/proprietor was willing to nonchalantly provide a cash refund without proper documentation.

That Joe and Grant did not offer more than a slight apology and did not offer any refunds or discounts for the inexplicable, weeklong, frustrating experience nor any explanation or apology for why they would perform a service without my consent is unacceptable service. Most other businesses would agree and would provide some concessions to keep the consumer happy. I am a small business owner myself, and consistently work to ensure customers are satisfied. A simple apology and offer of a discount or complimentary service for the inconvenience and poor service would have sufficed on this occasion. Joe Baeza and Grant McMaster made no effort to keep my business, apologize, or satisfy the customer in any way. I seek no recompense, but wish for everyone to know about my rather poor customer service experience at Dean's Auto Repair.

On Thursday, August 17th, I brought my car into Dean's Auto Repair on 32nd St & Oak in Phoenix to replace the driver-side mirror that had been knocked off in a hit-and-run. I also needed an oil change, so I presented the office manager with a coupon for that service. I was then informed by their service advisor, Joe Baeza that the part would not be available until the following morning. Joe asked if I wanted to have the oil change then or when they replaced the mirror, and I said to do it all together the following day.

Friday, August 18th. I dropped off the car at 11am. I received a call from Joe at 3:15pm and was told that the repair was not completed. Joe said they had first ordered the wrong part, which had to be sent back. Then, they ordered the right part but it was for the wrong side of the car. I was also told that the oil change hadn't been performed. I went immediately to the shop. There, I was told that they actually had finished the oil change (why didn't he know that?), and that I could pay after the mirror was replaced.

Monday, August 21st. My wife called and inquired about the part. They said they did not have it yet, but would call on Tuesday morning and let her know to bring it in. 

Tuesday, August 22nd. No call. 

Wednesday, August 23rd. I go to Dean's at 10:30am and they still do not have the part. I tell them that I know for a fact I could go to the O'Reilly's Auto Parts store down the street and get the correct part right now. Joe Baeze, whom we dealt with throughout this entire experience, agrees with me but doesn't explain what was taking so long. He picks up the phone and calls someone I assumed to be their parts supplier. After a brief conversation, Joe informs me that the part should arrive that afternoon, and he'd call me as soon as it arrived. We decide to give them one more chance. No call came from Dean's that afternoon.

Thursday, August 24th. I receive a call from Joe at 7:45am - an unacceptably early call. Joe did apologize for the early call, and informed me the part was there. I brought the car in at 1:00pm. They replaced the mirror. I paid the bill, and left at 2:15pm. Upon further inspection of the bill I noticed two things: they had not applied the coupon that was presented, and they had also performed a cabin air filter change without our prior knowledge or consent. I went back to the shop at 3:00pm. When I pointed this out to the owner, Grant McMaster, he said he'd take care of it. After a minute, Grant returned and said that he didn't want to deal with the paperwork for the refund, and presented me with a five dollar bill, which he explained covered the $4.80 difference between the price I paid for the oil change and the discounted coupon rate. When I asked about the filter, Grant told me that it wasn't covered by the coupon. At this time, Joe came into the room. I told Grant that's fine, but I wasn't going to pay for it because I was never informed about the service. Joe then said he could have sworn he told me, and I insisted I was never told that our filter needed replacing and recounted the events of Friday the 18th. Joe then asked if I wanted to see the old filter, because he was sure they still had it lying around somewhere (why?). Grant then said he would take care of it, and they both left. No apologies were made to me. A few minutes later, Joe returned with an old cabin air filter, and asked me if he wanted it. Confused, I replied that I did not want it. Joe then informed me that he meant that we would not have a cabin air filter in his car. Realizing then what Joe was asking, I told him this was ridiculous, and to put the old filter back into my car. I was then presented a check and the five dollar bill, but was given no explanation of what this reimbursement was covering or a new receipt. Frustrated and bewildered by the experience, I simply left."
4,5,"We have traditionally taken our vehicles strictly to the dealerships for any type of repairs. Recently my wife found a coupon for Dean's in the ValuPak. She convinced me to give them a try and we are glad we did. 

She celled them to talk about to schedule an appointment. When she got off the phone she just couldn't stop raving about their customer service. That was just the first call. The following day we dropped the car off to them 15 minutes before they opened for the day. Again, great customer service.

The great customer service just kept consistent through our entire experience. Their quality of work has been great and they don't try to push repairs on you.

I didn't use it, but I understand that they offer a shuttle service.

Since writing this review I have received a phone call from them making sure that I was satisfied with their service and received a thank you card in the mail. They continue to impress me. When was the last time you got that level of service from anyone?"
4,1,"Had my first experience with Dean's auto back in January. Spend just over $400 to get a coolant leak fixed. Everything was great until my car broke down a month later. I popped my hood, only to see the top of the coolant outlet connector they replaced had blown off. I had coolant everywhere. I called Dean's to tell them what happened and they said they would fix their mistake no problem. They replaced the part but when I went to pick up my car, they told me I had a horrible coolant leak. I explained that's what I had gotten fixed back in January. They told me it was going to cost me more money for them to figure out where the leak was coming from. I refused to let them touch my car. I brought it to another mechanic to find out the ""leak"" was a $2.00 fix. A metal clamp that holds the hose in place was loose. If the mechanics at Dean's can't spot a loose metal hose clamp, I wouldn't trust them with a simple oil change. Before I left Dean's, I asked the manager to write down my number and have the owner call me. I have yet to receive a phone call."
4,5,"I went to Dean's auto repair and I was extremely impressed with the level or professionalism, service, and knowledge. I first heard about Dean's from my girlfriend who's Dad used to go to deans. I am a cynic and can find fault in everything. When I first I called deans for my Nissan Sentra they were very accommodating that I would be arriving late. They then checked my vehicle and were very honest about what was actually wrong. The transmission was completely shot. They explained that they keep up to date with professional publications and blogs in their industry and remembered reading about an extended warranty on my specific type of transmission. Deans called the dealership and made sure that my transmission was covered under the extension. They then transferred the car for me to the dealership and didn't charge me diagnostics even through they weren't doing the work. Other mechanics I have encountered do not keep up to date on everything in their industry since it is an additional cost. Other mechanics would not have bothered to check the warranty since the standard warranty was clearly over. Most mechanics would have tried to keep that work for themselves so they could profit. The cost for the warranty transmission was $5K and it was completely covered. Dean's went above and beyond in service and professionalism despite the lack of financial gain on their part. Their only request was to spread to work to family and friends if I get a chance. This is true customer service and Deans has earned my loyalty as a lifetime customer for me and my family."
4.5,5,"I Hate The Heat!  My automatic electrical transfer switch went out.  At the time I had no idea what happened and why my generator would not put any power out. Though my generator was experiencing overheating shutoff issues my transfer switch went bad not allowing for the power from the generator to power my RV.  Which meant no AC while driving through death valley while it was 127 degrees.  I was able to find Keith of general quality RV repair.  He seemed to be a good honest person and relatively quickly found the issue.  He was able to locate an acceptable new replacement part within an hour and had it installed within 2 hours after his arrival.  $900 later $600 for the part, he seems to have fixed the issue.  
Support your local independent business and a veteran."
4.5,5,"Called two other mobile RV repair businesses in Clark County; one never returned the calls, the other returned the initial calls but after giving us a quote they never followed up when we were ready for work to be done.

Keith at GQ Mobile RV Repair answered the phone quickly, gave us a quote and scheduled right away. He was here the next day and replaced my microwave/convection oven quickly and professionally. On time, on price, and on top of that he was very helpful with questions we had about our RV. 

When I'm in Vegas he'll be my only choice for RV repairs."
4.5,5,"Wow. When the chips were down these guys got me on the road.  They are clever, resourceful and did a great job for me when I really needed to be on the road. They are knowledgeable and straight shooters.  What they know about RVs is just amazing"
4.5,3,"Keith came out right away when I was having an issue with my tanks...they dropped the underbelly and found plastic parts from the dealer in the pipe.  They cleared them out and got things working.

Keith did text me the next day to make sure thing we're going well which was nice...

Why not 5 stars???

I sent him a text a week ago saying I'm having a problem with the valve and to date I've not received a response back.

I'm going to have to call someone else and have them come out and check my tanks...Keith is a nice guy but now I have to pay another person to come out and check the same thing I paid him to fix.  

I'm not saying I don't recommend this company, try it and leave your own review, I just can't give him 5 stars..."
2.5,1,"Sold me what was to be a perfectly functioning boat and trailer.  Said there was no need for a water trial because it was mechanically sound and if there was a problem to just bring it back Picked up the purchased vessel and trailer on 5-2 2015. Put in the water 5-3 2015. Boat would not go over 5mph. Upon pulling the broken vessel out of the trailer on the ramp the winch was broken and boat slid off of the trailer on to the ramp. It happened about 10 ft up the ramp. I was standing by the winch from attaching it to the boat and I was hit by the winch and fell. I sustained injury to my right hand, left forearm, and left leg.  Rear end of the boat was sitting on the concrete, it gouged the hull and damaged the drive, it was literally a nightmare come true.  Very lucky as even though I was injured someone could literally have been killed.   Boat was returned on monday. Owner stated he would ""help"" me out with the fixes implying he would not be standing behind his responsibility to provide the product sold to me.  I inquired as to the protocols the company has in place to safety check vessels and was not given an answer.  I would NEVER trust this company with whatever they claim on either boats they sell or work on.  They are very lucky no one was permanently harmed or even worse killed.  To make matters worse boat was dropped off day after the incident, it is now 5 days later, they haven't ""had the time"" to look at it or decide what to do yet."
2.5,5,"Great family business.  Bill and Terri were able to sell our pontoon boat and got us an amazing deal on our new boat.  highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy, sell or service their boat"
2.5,1,Terrible customer service. Dropped off my key at their shop to repair my boat. Boat is in a marina. Have been waiting over a month (35  days) and boat still not picked up. Was kept being told that no trailer was available. No phone calls or anything. On the 35th day I was told and I quote ( it's not our fault that you don't have a trailer). Hung up the phone and went to pick up my key! They could care less about losing a customer. New shop will pick up boat in 2 days. Don't waste you time with this shop!
5,5,"I have a travel trailer with a seasonal site at a campground. Most people who have these sites either don't have the means to tow these trailers to get fixed. If they do, it's a hassle to tow these RV's to one of the few places in the area that fix RV's. A guy like Dave Hall, is invaluable to someone like me.

I had a furnace that was only blowing cold air, a leaky roof and a leaky kitchen faucet. Not only was he able to come out to my campground (he's willing to travel in a 200 mile radius), but he fixed everything that day for only $235!!!!! If I had taken my camper to a garage, they would've charged at least $115 an hour in labor and even more for parts. I'm sure my bill with them would been double or triple what I paid Dave. 

Dave also couldn't have been nicer or more friendly to talk to. You could tell he really enjoyed camping and people who own RV's.

As if he isn't valuable enough, Dave told me that he does home repairs as well. I'll revise my review of his services after I set up my appointment to have him fix some stuff around my house."
5,5,my name is ray and had a severe water issue with my camper and frantically tried to resolve the issue to no avail.my camper is set upon a permanent campsite and dont have the means to take it to a dealer.another fellow camper said he had heard of someone in the area that did repairs.i got the number and called daves mobile rv repair in streetsboro. when i called the company dave hall answered the phone and introduced himself.i explained my situation and was in immediate need of repair of a severe water leak that was flowing everywhere from the underside of the camper.he told me what to immediately look for all the while staying on the phone with me.he then sent his employees right out to investigate the problem so no further damage was done.his employees where very pleasant and thoughtful to my problem.they found where the problem was coming from in short order and had the water stopped shortly.they had the repair fixed in a timely manner.they also advised me of what caused the water line to rupture in the first place (some not so friendly mice).they chewed through the lines under the bathroom floor in a very difficult area to get to.thank you dave and your employees for your fast and curtious employees and your pricing was just unbeatable.i surely will call you again when i need something done.       sincerely ray m. from ravenna
5,5,"Last year, I called Dave's to come out to my fifth wheel on a seasonal site. Both of my air conditioners were not working. Dave showed up at the agreed upon time, assessed both air conditioners, and advised that he would submit the info to Dometic for warranty repairs. Later, he called to tell me he had two new AC units and needed to schedule a time to install them. They have worked well since then. I wouldn't hesitate to call for Dave's service again."
3,1,"We were shopping for an RV and when we arrived at Sahara at 9am on a Monday, the salesman Len seemed inconvenienced by our presence.  He waved us out on to the lot and said ""I'll catch up with you"", that never happened.  The inventory looked like something from the 1970s and the newer stuff was very dirty and mostly in poor repair. The neighborhood was sketchy, overall a very unimpressive experience."
3,1,"I purchased a toy hauler from them. The main issue is the generator which worked on there lot, and once off never worked again.  After talking to service many times, with them not caring, they finally said to bring it in for a fee they would check it out. I took it in, they said "" we did a thumb compression test on it and it's no good, come pick up and we won't charge "" so they waisted my time and sold me something that was defective.   To add the 08 23 attitude had only 5 hrs on generator still had the new papers in refrigerator it was hardly used great condition. I won't go back"
3,3,"We have rented twice through Sahara RV and both times we have had relatively good experiences. The prices for renting a trailer are great and the reservation process is always very easy.
The first time we rented was May 2015 and the person we helped us was Bryana and she was very polite and helpful. The only issue we had when we went to pick up the trailer we reserved my husband had to wait over 2 hours for the trailer and then to find out the one that we reserved the fridge was not working so they gave us another that was a bit smaller then we wanted but we were okay with that. They ended up waving the prep fee and also giving us a free night on our next rental, so we were satisfied and ended up having a great time on our trip and with the rest of the experience with Sahara was great.
We just rented again with Sahara this May 2016 for our annual camping trip again. This time the person who helped us was Laura who was very nice with the initial rental and getting the trailer. The trailer we rented was the one we wanted but it wasn't in the best condition but that is to be expected with a rental trailer. A shelf was broken in the back and when we started heading out of town the tire cover ripped off. We dropped off the trailer and the following day we got our final invoice which stated that we got charged a dumping fee of $30. We were a little confused since we went to the dumping station at panguitch lake before heading out of town and make sure that the black and grey tanks were dumped. When I called Laura to talk about this she said that her technician spent 30 minutes dumping the tank. I told her that this was not possible because we made sure both tanks were emptied. She then said that she would not waive the fee and if I wanted to argue more I could argue with the technician. Again I spoke with the technician and explained again that we dumped both tanks which he replied that they were both full. I said that that was odd since we didn't even use that much fresh water and when we left the fresh water was 2/3 full. We only used the bathroom to go pee and washed our dishes outside when we were camping. My husband did empty the fresh tank as well while driving to save on gas. He finally said that we would waive the fee but not before stating that they had comp'd a night but not knowing why, implying that we were just trying to get something for free. Laura then emailed me back a new invoice stating that the dump fee was waived even though the tanks were absolutely full.
I'm not the kind of person to make such a huge deal or even write reviews but I'm willing to argue a charge if I don't feel it was valid.
All in all, not the best end to our trip and not sure if we will rent again.
* A sensor can say it's full and it not be full anyone who has own a trailer or has used one knows this, a piece of toilet paper can cover the sensor ... It's just the fact that I was frustrated because I wouldn't lie about dumping tanks and your employees were rude about it. I will not recommend to anyone to rent from you, it just can't go smooth and seems like there will always be some problem."
3,5,"Incredible customer service from rental manager Laura M. She not only provided helpful, accurate, friendly info when I called, she emailed be a quote within minutes of speaking and arranged a 'test drive' for me to make sure I would be comfortable driving the 31' Forester to Montana with my 3 kids. 

The older RV was very well maintained. Will made sure I was thoroughly comfortable and familiar with all the systems before heading out. I had Laura and Will's cell numbers 'just in case'. 

When we returned from our amazing trip, there was damage to the lower trim on the slide out. Laura was above and beyond fair with getting a damage repair quote... Didn't charge for labor and have me a milage credit. Who does that?! So kind!

It was a trip of a lifetime that my children will never forget and Sahara RV made it possible. I highly recommend this local company."
3,1,To Sahara RV...There was no mix up.  You had the pump in stock.  Price for that model around $100 everywhere in Las Vegas area including your website.  The pump you tried to soak me for $253 was readily bought just down the street for $103...the going rate.  I urge other RVers to shop elsewhere!
3,5,"You guys Rock! Seriously, we had the best experience with Sahara RV.  I live in So. California and needed to rent a tent trailer to travel to Utah. From the initial email conversation to the final drop off, amazing customer service.  Laura communicated with me via email, she answered all of my questions and quoted me a great price for rental.  Will assisted us with the instructions on setting the trailer up etc.  He is super.  What a nice guy.  He was so helpful in making sure my hitch was set up correctly and showed us how to operate everything on the trailer.  Then at drop off, we see Will, again.  He isn't even working, it was his day off, and he grabbed my truck, backed the trailer in for us, checked it us in and finalized the paper work.  That is great customer service.  We will be renting and possibly buying from Sahara RV in the near future.  Thanks Laura and Will!!"
3,5,"I want to thank Sahara RV's service center!! We were on our way back from a long vacation when our brakes started grinding. We called at least 10 different rv companies that had service departments. We were told by the small few that called back that they didn't have time for us. 

Sahara RV picked up immediately when we called and told us that they would make room for us due to the fact that we were just passing through on our way home. 

We were in a time crunch and they started working right away! They not only fixed our brakes, but they kept us informed, and fixed it in time for us to head back to California on time. 

Thank you so much for your fantastic customer service, your help and communication in a difficult situation, and your sense of humor!! In the future, Anytime we are in the Vegas area and we need work done on Ol' Bessie, we know where to go!!

Thanks again guys!! You're awesome!!"
3,3,"I rented a pop-up trailer from Sahara RV Center. The price was great and Laura at the front counter was very helpful, but the trailer should have been checked out more thoroughly before it was rented to me. 
I got pulled over by NHP because the brake light didn't work and I had to take the trailer back to have it fixed which delayed my trip a whole day. I did get a refund, but there were a few other things on the trailer that should have been attended to before it was rented to me. 
I would go back to them again and rent a trailer, but I would check it out myself before taking it."
3,5,"Excellent service Laura was amazing at helping, I can't see my self going anywhere else from now on. Great rentals, great workers, best experience hands down."
3,1,"This is a review of their service department, not their rentals.   

My elderly parent's motor home was about 1 hour out of Vegas and 1/2 the roof blew off.   I did a quick search on Yelp and found Sahara RV center.  I spoke to the service manager, Ken, who told me he had 35 years experience and that they could fix it.   They could order a new roof from California and have the job done the following Tuesday.   Since there was no water damage under the roof, he said insurance would most likely pay (the cost was about $9,000).  Great!  So far so good!!!!

However, when my parents returned, the new roof was terrible. The workmanship was so sloppy.  There were bubbles on the roof and sloppy caulking.  And there were two holes in the new roof!!! I am attaching pictures so you can see for yourself.  One good note is that they did finish when they said they would.   But the work quality was so bad my parents insurance is paying to have it completely re-done.  Beware of their service department!!!!!!   Like I said, rentals may be a different thing.  I feel really bad that I steered my parents to their service dept.   What a huge mistake.  Hopefully, this isn't a common result.  Better to not make the same mistake I did."
3,4,"We rented an RV for an 11 day vacation in Utah. The RV was comfortable and up to the task. We especially appreciated Laura and Will. Laura was very responsive in answering our questions prior to booking and the price was good with no unexpected add-ons. Will did a great job in explaining the various functions of the RV as well as some quirks of this older RV (2008 model), including a gas gauge that wasn't accurate.  That was annoying but not a huge issue. We incurred a damaged shade screen over the push out dining section. Not sure how, but know it was okay when we left and there when we returned. Will was great and the repair costs were very reasonable. My son left a battery charger in the RV that we didn't notice for another week and again Laura and Will located it and mailed it back to us.  So all in all a good experience with the RV and the friendly helpful service."
3,5,"have rented for years, always great, trailers,toy halter, Rvs .fast friendly and easy going. If you ever went to the other renters you will love these guys.And they are us the lowest in price."
3,1,"BEWARE!!! This place is horrible!! It's a SCAM!! After filling out the forms at checkout to confirm damages prior to renting, this place will still charge you for repairs and keep your deposit!! They won't even send the copy that we filled out and both parties signed!! They also tried charging us for going over 1000 miles!! Which we did not!! We had to drop off the RV after hours and fly back to California, they knew this and is taking advantage of us!! DO NOT USE THEM!!!! They have ruined our vacation and we will NEVER use them again!!! They won't return any of our emails, Laura is horrible!!"
3,5,This place has great customer service! They totally helped me on the weekend install a breaking system on my vehicle even though they normally don't have techs on Saturday! The tech stayed and assisted me and was super nice! All the other places I called refused to assist me on a weekend! Good place to check out!
3,3,"Actually I'm pretty familiar with how many tanks are on a trailer. I know that there is a fresh water tank, grey water tank and black water tank. I wasn't positive that my husband dumped the fresh water tank as well, until I doubled checked with him. I don't understand why you keep modifying your response, months after I reviewed your company. It's time to move on and stop coming back to my review and focus on improving the customer service for current and future people who decide to rent from you."
3,5,"Truly deserves 5-stars!  General Manager Wiley came to our aid on a sizzling hot July afternoon. We were in Death Valley when the crank decided to strip its gears (or something) & it wasn't going to lower the top. My husband got underneath & took off screws from stuff and we pushed & locked it down- knowing it's broken. We made it to Las Vegas approximately 15 minutes before closing time on a Friday afternoon & we pulled our tent-trailer in. Mr. Wiley personally took care of us!  He crawled under (with his back on melting asphalt) to look at the problem.  He told us he'd try to get us back on the road by Tuesday. Imagine our surprise when he called us mid-morning on Monday and it was ready!  He put in new parts and it works better than ever!  The repair price was not gouging - very fair for we weary travelers! He saved our vacation!  4 teenagers will never forget it - and their parents won't either!  THANK YOU, Mr. WILEY!  You're a good man and hard worker!  Great customer service!  You cared!"
3,1,"Place is horrible. Used trailers are over priced and almost as much as a new one, service was horrendous, made an appointment with Kelly, he never showed up or answered my calls or texts. So I asked for another sales person, they had to find one, no one around. Very unorganized place."
3,4,Had everything we needed to continue our preciousventure.com.  The man at the register was extremely pleasant and super helpful even though his pc was acting up in him.
3,1,"Don't you dare rent something out of this company !!! This company is a SCAM !!! We got a broken RV and we only found out after we went on a trip. The people who worked there spoke very badly to us when we tried to explain it, and were very rude."
3,4,"We recently rented an RV for our summer trip to Yosemite National Park. 

Pricing: The best in town! You can't beat the pricing, a flat fee + free miles (more than any other rental place) and then a $/mile thereafter. The pricing was clear upfront; so, we knew exactly what we were in for. The pricing for the linens, dishes per person was high, but this was typical across the board; so, we decided to bring all of our own stuff.

Staff: The staff is very nice. My only compliant is that when I called to ask questions about the RV  - could we use the stove while driving, laws about kids being buckled/in car seats, etc. We had to call back a few times to get answers, but they were able to answer all of our questions eventually.

Response: A few miles after we embarked on our journey we ran into an issue with the A/C unit not working.... we called and they and walked us through the issue. Ends up it was user error!

RV: We didn't know exactly what we were getting ahead of time because there aren't many pictures available on their website, but we did know that it would fit all of the bodies we needed it to. When we picked it up, we were satisfied. It was just perfect - in great condition, clean and ran well. My only compliant here is that the mattresses could probably be updated, they are a bit dingy.

They walked us through the operation of the RV and answered all of our questions. They were seemingly more flexible than other options around Las Vegas and beyond with pick up/drop off, etc. 

We would most definitely rent from Sahara RV in the future. Thank you!"
3,4,"Besides leaving Vegas when it was 115 degrees and the AC powered by the generator dying on us, we had a great experience.  It took a while for the refrigerator to get cold because it hadn't been plugged in two days prior, but we only lost some turkey that spoiled. Laura ended up giving us a break at close out.
Laura was kind and helpful and Will, the technician,  had a great sense of humor and was very personable.  
We climbed some serious elevation in Utah and the Jamboree ran great.  I would definitely rent from this company again."
3,1,"never ever going with this company again! The girl Laura who is in charge of rental gave me horrible customer service and attitude when returning  the RV. I know I'm responsible for any damage and of course I'm going to pay but she literally acts like its her Own car that was damage. Guys be careful if you decide to go with this company take your own pictures when inspecting the RV before you sign and rent it. The RVs are a little old and when I took it, it seemed fine but as I was driving all the cabinets where coming out and things inside falling off. Never ever will I rent from Sahara RV again! I was trying to save money but at the end, ended up worst. They give you free mileage but trust me... It ends up not being worth it. Over all... Worst customer service ever, old RVs,  the guys are nosy, kept on asking where I was traveling to and how far ect. If you decide to take your chances "" take pictures of everything"" make sure picture has date. Take pictures of inside out and the top. Absolutely read every paper very well cus they are sneaky and won't tell you all details. In the end I asked to deal with someone else due to Laura's horrible customer service."
3,5,Great service. I am very happy with the pop up tent I purchased after I won the auction on Ebay. Thanks Junior!
3,1,"I got an RV that was a complete disaster. The passenger and driver compartment heated to unbearable temperatures, the A/C worked intermittently, and the side door was a challenge to open.

I brought it back with my complaints expecting some sort of money back. I paid for a fully functional RV, what I got was something else.

They gave me a $50 credit. Weak.. obviously I'm one of many who have had a terrible experience with these people. 

Stay away would be my recommendation."
3,5,There are so many places you can rent from but what set apart Sahara RV was the amazing customer service from Laura!  I cannot stress what an asset she is to this company!  This trip was my first time driving and I was nervous!  All my fears were put to ease and she went out of her way to call me just to check in and make sure everything was OK.  The personal attention was a relief in a time where human interaction is laking.  Thank you Laura for making this my best rental experiance!
3,5,"Last month I had to rent an RV for work reasons. Every dealership in town had absolutely nothing to offer but Sahara RV. I worked with junior and Monica in parts and the experience was absolutely out standing! I never new about this dealership before, but now I could never see myself going anywhere else. 5 STARS SAHARA RV!"
3,5,"My husband and I LOVE camping but our best friends are not big fans. I had been trying to come up with a solution we could all be happy with, and Sahara RV was the answer! We rented an RV for our trip which kept everyone happy. Everyone we came in contact with here were great, very professional and able to answer all my question. I'm a BIG planner and they helped get me prepared by answering all my questions in a timely manner (and not getting annoyed with the ridiculous amount of questions I asked! Always a us lol) we will definitely be using Sahara RV for our next group trip as they were great to work with am made our vacation that much better. Thanks so much for making my trip easy!"
3,5,Amazing customer service! Have used this company for family trips regularly and have never been disappointed. Units are very well taken care of and run nicely. Staff is extremely friendly and always helpful. Highly recommend!!! 10/10
3,1,"We rented from Sahara RV, originally ordered the 24"" RV however were called the day before because it broke down in Colorado and were told we were upgraded to the 28' RV. I should have known then there could be issues when the other had broke down. 

Our upgraded RV was old and tattered.  One of the couches swayed from side to side when driving and the arm rest constantly fell off, it has a huge metal piece on it to hold it in that is extremely dangerous when it falls.  The seats where the table is had cushions that did not stay on while driving.  Only one side had seat belts.  The side of the panel does not hang right and is falling off the side, the other side was stapled on with large exposed staples we had to cover so our 2 year old didn't cut herself.  The drapes next to the sink were dirty with food, the blinds in back did not stay on the window.  The RV did not have a privacy screen so at night we had to cover it with a blanket so people could not see in.  The screen door did not have a screen on the door handle part so we could not leave the door open while sleeping or someone could walk in with the exposed handle.  The list goes on and on, overall our upgraded RV with 150,000+ miles was a huge disappointment.

This was the least expensive option we found but went with them because they were the only ones with availability the week we were looking for.  I understand why.  I will never rent from them again nor recommend them."
3,1,Do not go here!!!!   They put a poly glow on the outside of our new trailer and it left streaks and cloud marks and runs In The fiberglass.  The manager refuses to fix it and put any more labor into it.  They promised to take care of it and were not able to fix it.  Cost us 1200 00 and they will not reimburse us.  They were not qualified to do the work.  We are in the process of suing them.
3,5,"Found what we wanted, smooth from start to finish. Delivered as promised.

An RV is not an inexpensive purchase so do your research before you dive in head first.
Everyone was up front and honest. Like most businesses they are in it to make money and if you want cheap they will sell you a piece of crap but you the consumer need to remember Price is directly connected to quality. Look at nadaguides.com before you buy.
Keep in mind a simple statement on your receipt ""AS IS"" if its not right and you don't catch an issue it is your problem not theirs.

Good luck and safe travels."
3,5,Sahara is great  very nice service people  great customer service  I've never worked with such a great company.thanks for getting our Rv on the road so quit !!
3,5,"My husband and I made a impromptu trip to Las Vegas this last weekend and decided to try renting a camper again. We have used other companies in this area in the past and they didn't meet our expectations so we were nervous.  Let me just say that this was the best rv rental company we have ever used and we rent campers a lot. The staff was beyond friendly, answering any questions we had and made sure we were comfortable with the RV before we took off! When we go back to Vegas, we will definitely be using them again! I can't remember the rental managers name, but she was very knowledgeable and had a smile on her face. The technicians were also helpful when we returned the cam"
3,1,"We left our 1999 travel trailer with them on consignment for 6 months. We assumed that this company was reputable and honest because they had been in business for 35 years. When we picked up the trailer, the ladder had been crunched against the trailer as if it had been backed into something. The ladder had been broken and it was pulled away from the roof. One of our propane tanks was missing and someone tracked oil in their footprints on the carpet. Also the leveler bubble, the marker and the screen on the screen door were destroyed. We wrote a letter including pictures and left it for the owner. We did not get a response. Do NOT leave your RV on consignment here!!!!!!!"
3,1,"One star because there is no zero option.  Needed a water pump.  Website says $108.99 so I confirm they have it in stock.  Get there, and when they realized I was in a bind(I assume), suddenly price is now $253.  I think not.  Many other places had the same pump for just over $100.  I bought it from some really nice folks at Double Eagle RV for $103...brand new."
3,1,"Last year I turned my motorhome in for repairs. I paid the bill and left, its a 39 foot motorhome and the way they had it parked I had no reason to walk around it, they were working on mechanical issues, when I got home I found they had crash the rear side. I called and left a message with no response, went down there and was told someone must have backed into it they would look into it, went down again was told they would fix it, went down there again and was told to turn it into my insurance and tell them that Sahara RV did it. Since I don't owe anything on it and have driven it for 10 years without an incident  I don't carry comp ,  so now I'm stuck with a crashed RV. I should have taken it to small claims. Don't trust them check everything out yourself. I have never before written a negative review,  but I'm getting ready to use it and it's really irritating me for a place to get away with this."
3,1,"This is the absolute worst rv rental place ever.Old high mile and dirty RV's. If you need to rent, buy or sell an rv do yourself a big favor and run from this place. Im sure the good reviews here were written by them! Service is a joke at best between the tacking things together and the 100% mark up on parts your better to go ANYWHERE else."
3,1,"We were in need of help. They said they could take us and fix our issue same day. That night they called us and said they needed a week. We said we could not take a week, we were on vacation far from home. We picked up our RV. They said issue was fixed. We paid and back @ camp issue came back. When we got home from our trip a friend and I opened up the panel and discovered not only did they cut wires, but they cut our heating vent and did not reseal it!!! 
DO NOT USE THIS PLACE!! Unless you want to get ripped off!!"
3,5,"I rented a 31' Class C Sunseeker for a week long trip to Zion, Bryce Canyon, and the Grand Canyon.  I checked out three other RV companies, and Sahara was the only one where someone picked up the phone whenever I called.  Also, they were one of the few who could tell me the exact type of RV I would have (most others operate a network so it just depends on availability - Sahara has its own fleet).  Not only that, but they were the lower end of the price scale!

These guys have simply the best customer service - from Heather who takes care of the booking to Greg who prepped us on the generator and everything else we would need to know for our trip.  I'm assuming they are also pretty good if you're in the market for buying an RV rather than just renting, too.

In short, if you are thinking about an RV trip out of Las Vegas, call Sahara RV!"
3,1,"If you're looking to get screwed then Sahara RV is the place to go! If I could leave ZERO stars then I would. My husband and I were so excited to buy an RV and it's been nothing but a nightmare! We were told an inspection would be done and that we would get a walk through. When we showed up for the walk through we were rushed through it. The tires on it were falling apart and we were told they wouldn't replace tires. One of them was gouged and the tread was coming off, their response was, ""if the tire blows during delivery and there is any damage, our insurance will cover it"". Who says that?! Who would even risk that? Dumb!! Then when we had arrangements for delivery, they tried to get the address and drop it off without us even being there.

Well we now know why... Because the jacks were going out and they didn't want us to see how the trailer was being lifted on and off a truck. We bring the thing home and the fridge doesn't work, the entire jack system needed replaced, and we were told you bought it ""as is"". We hadn't even owned the thing a week. We haven't even taken the thing out yet and we have had to replace 5 of the 6 tires, put a new motor in the fridge and replace the entire jack system for a whopping total of $2200. 
When we took it out the first time we were at a full hook up spot so no generator needed. When we did try to get the generator up and running it wouldn't stay on for more then 5 minutes. After having their service dept look at it, they tested the carburetor, nope not that, it's a blown piston. So the generator still has the same number of hours on it then when we bought it and the thing doesn't even run. Problem after problem after problem. This place is a total rip off!!! It's been nothing but a money pit since we bought it. What a shady business!! 
And all this on a 2007. DO NOT GO HERE... STAY FAR AWAY. Unless dumping thousands of dollars in repairs to a new purchase is your thing, purchase elsewhere. 

Sahara RV you suck!! Way to screw over families on huge purchases like this! If I could park this thing in their lobby and tell them to take it back I would."
3,5,"We ended up with a broken receiver on our tow vehicle while vacationing in Vegas. Sahara worked with us to get a new receiver and shank so that we could get on our way.

There were a few glitches with ordering, but Sahara went overboard to make sure it gone done.

Thanks!"
3,1,"I bought a AC Unit from Sahara RV. Put it on our travel trailer. Worked for 2 days and stopped working. Mind you i just purchased last week. I called And the service employee says you can bring it in but we will charge you $150 for inspection?!?? I explained to him that we just purchased last week. He says it doesn't matter!?
They sold me a faulty unit! I called the warranty company and they were taken back when i told them they were going to charge us for a inspection when we just purchased it."
3,1,"BUYER BEWARE!! We just recently purchased a travel trailer and on day 3 the axle broke. We had rented before and should have known better - there were always little things that were broken or not working. They refused to help with any payment for the damage.  Please, please be careful when purchasing or renting from this company- they overcharge and don't stand behind any of their sales or rentals."
3,5,"Had such a fantastic experience renting from James with Sahara RV! The price and service is unmatched by any other RV rental locations in the area. I know this because I spent weeks trying to find a rental within our budget that would accommodate a pick up early in the morning and drop off close to 5pm to maximize our 3 day trip to the Hoover dam, Grand Canyon and Zion. This was hands down the best price in the area for a fantastic vehicle.

James recommended the 26' Freelander, which we affectionately named Becky, and she drove like a queen. For 3 ladies who have never driven such a large vehicle before, we were impressed by his easy it was to drive.

All of the costs were well-explained up front. We planned to go over the free 500 Miles because of how many stop we wanted to make over 3 days, but it was worth $90 extra to hit 2 NPs and the dam.

Even after 5 nights staying at the Bellagio, this was hands down the most amazing part of our trip! Thanks Sahara RV!!! I look forward to renting again in the future."
4,5,Jared goes the extra mile and gets the job done! I have recommended him to several people and I recommend him to you! He will as their name says- get you back on the road again as quickly as possible with the least amount of money out of your pocket.
4,5,"Thank you Jared for all the time you needed to spend to correct the stupidity of the suppliers in this industry who supply faulty new equipment.  I still can't believe the total lack of quality control for products they provide you as techs to do the quality work you do.  I would pull my hair out if I had to I add as many hours as you've had to correcting their errors but first of all figuring out the manufacturing mishaps and faults in product quality of the suppliers and manufacturers.   Once again,  thank you for so many extra hours for diagnosis and completion of a distressing and frustrating ac Repair only made more difficult by faulty parts distribution.   I know how busy you are even off season and I can see why,  your dedication to perfection is obvious and much appreciated.  I know sometimes communication is an issue since so much of the burden falls on you and cliff but with the current addition of a knowledgeable and personable staff member like Kelly I trust the communication issues are being addressed.   Thanks again to you and Cortni , as well as Cliff, really almost as smart as you, Kelly and ed and the new kid Dustin.  You've added some quality help and thank you for all you've done for Joanee and me."
4,1,"Wish there was zero star rating!

We contacted On The Road Again RV Repair last Monday morning (10/3) at 8 am as we had Dometic AC unit out which is still under warranty.  I spoke with Jarred and he said he could come out that day and could repair under warranty.  Jarred said he would call me back in a few minutes to let me know what time he would arrive.  After 2 hours, I had not heard from him, so I called him back and he said he would be here at 4:00.  

Jarred showed up about 4:45.  He inspected our unit and said it would have to be replaced.  He said he would order it when he got back to the shop and, since it was after 5 pm, he would not receive the unit till Wednesday and he would come install on Wednesday or Thursday.  I should mention he left the parts of the AC unit all over our bedroom rather than putting it back together or telling me he was going to leave the cover, filter etc off and putting the pieces neatly in one place.  He said he would call me 1st thing Tuesday morning as soon as he received the tracking # from Dometic, and schedule the appointment.    I never heard from Jarred on Tuesday and called his office and left a message at 10 am on Wednesday - no response.  I left messages on both Jarred's office and cell phone on Thursday - no response.   I left messages on Jarred's office and cell Friday morning - no response.  Friday afternoon around 3 pm, I called his cell and he answered.  He said ""aren't you that nice lady at Pleasant Harbor?""  I said yes and he said ""remind me what we were going to do for you"".  Really???  I reminded him he was going to replace our AC unit under warranty and he said ""oh yeah, it came in today and it was smashed, so they're going to have to send another and we won't have it till Monday"".  I replied that I would have appreciated a return phone call (and I said this very nicely) and he said ""I don't need you getting nasty with me"".  I explained I wasn't being nasty, but he told me he would call me Tuesday and hadn't returned any of my phone calls since.  At this point he ""looked"" at his cell phone record and said he had no record of my call and he would have to call the phone company to complain.  Odd, because I called his cell and office.  I just wanted my AC unit, so I let it go.  

Jarred told me the replacement unit would be delivered on Monday and he would call me Monday to schedule his visit Tuesday to install.  My husband called both Jarred's cell and office on Monday and left voice mails.  Courtney from On The Road Again called me later that afternoon (1st time I spoke with her) and said the unit would be in Tuesday by 4 pm and Jarred would be out here at 5 pm to install.  I expressed my concern based on our experience to date (again, I was quite nice). Courtney's response was ""do you want us to cancel?""  I told Courtney I did not want to cancel, just would like some level of assurance based on my experience to date.  Again, she blamed the phone company (as it appears they have been doing for a year based on google reviews) Courtney assured me the unit would be there by 4 pm on Tuesday and Jarred would be here by 5 pm.   In the meantime, my husband called another repair center and scheduled an appointment for Tuesday.  After I told him they said Jarred would be out to install Tuesday afternoon, he made the decision to cancel the other repairman.  

5:30 on Tuesday, no word from either Jarred or Courtney.  My husband called both cell and office and got no answer, but was immediately ""butt dialed"" by Jarred and he could hear him talking in the background.  Courtney called me a few minutes later and said the unit had not come in yet and they had no control over the deliveries.  After reading google reviews, we realized this is a pattern of behavior with this company and called AJ at InsideOut Mobile RV Repair.  

AJ advised he could not get to us until Friday and would have to initiate a new claim with Dometic.  15 minutes later, AJ called back and said he received a call from Dometic asking if he would handle our claim.  Dometic said the unit was at On The Road Again and they were refusing to do warranty work, so he could pick up the unit and do our repair.  AJ asked Dometic about the other unit that was ""smashed"" and Dometic said they only shipped one unit. Once AJ was able to pick up our unit, he came and replaced immediately."
4,1,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!  I don't even know where to start.  THIS COMPANY IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL!!! On the Road Again RV came to my house to fix my RV. Their tech spent hours on my RV and still did not fix the problem.  In fact he made my problem worse.  Since they didn't fix it,  they came to look at it again at an off site location and spent another 5 hours, still did not fix.  I made multiple appointments with them to come back out and look at it and they did not call me back or show up.  Between texting and calling, no response.  Besides this, they spent hours on my RV and still didn't even give me an estimate or any idea what was wrong.  They then didn't show up for another appointment and my house, so finally we took to their shop.  Their shop told me it would be a couple days to fix it, 2 weeks past and still no call or even estimate.  Then I tried to call their shop for 3 days in a row and never got a phone call back.  All I wanted to know was what was wrong with my RV and how much it would be.  Finally when I reached someone on the phone, and it was the owner.  He told me I was a F-ing B*&tch and I needed to have my RV out of their shop in a couple hours and hung up on me.  Then when I called the company back to let them know I was unable to come in a few hours, I could hear the owner in the background yelling and cussing and throwing stuff around.  I honestly felt that I was going to need a police escort to even pick up my RV.  Outside of the fact they never even figured out the problem, they made my RV worse than it was originally.  All I have wrong is some water connections, and I am not sure why they act like this is rocket science. Good thing they didn't charge me for anything, since not only did they never give me an estimate or ask for my approval for charges, but they didn't fix anything.  What a waste of their time, my time, and honestly this is the most unprofessional business I have ever been worked with and I still can't believe that a business owner would speak to a customer by cussing, yelling and throwing stuff.  I would NEVER recommend On the Road Again RV to anyone.... BEWARE!!!"
4,1,It's honestly shocking to see the good reviews about this place they never return any of my calls strung out my job for weeks and Jared screamed in my face about how he was too busy to follow up with me about the status of my RVI would not recommend this place to anyone and will never be back there
4,5,"Jared and his team are awesome! We were on the road and needed our RV furnace fixed. We called em up and they said bring it in. 30 minutes later Jared met us out front. He began immediately working on the furnace. He ordered the part, drove to pick it up and had us back on the road. Jared and his team are not just part installers. They are professional technicians with experience to back it up!  That is hard to find anymore. He was concerned about the service to the customer and delivered a home run with us. He also recommended a place to stay and eat. Once again he delivered! Please take your RV needs to OTRA!! You won't be disappointed. BTW try out the Wildhorse West for the best burgers, chili and cold beer.  Thanks again for your help. You guys rock!"
4,1,"Well they did not return my call so I went online to set an appointment, that wasn't working. I took my trailer in anyways and got a story from the father Dave, I think. Was told I would get a quote today, did not happen. Going to pu trailer tomorrow."
4,1,"Incompetent, uncommunicative, dishonest, and unprofessional.  Unless you want to spend a ton of money for not much work, and potentially be outright lied to and cheated, I highly recommend you steer clear of these guys."
4,1,"A horrific experience. We trusted these people and they almost ruined our motor home. They are totally unethical in addition to being unskilled. 

Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this business. They talk a good game but there is absolutely nothing backing it up. Just broken promises."
4,5,"I had work done by Jared a few years ago before he opened his brick and morter shop in Glendale. He did 480w solar and many other upgrades including AGM batteries he suggested. Great suggestion, very pleased with everything he has done.  Well, back for a punch list of 2 dozen things and Jared, Cliff and Courtney make you feel like you are the only customer they are working with. I can't and haven't found more qualified and more gracious people in this industry or as a matter any service industry I've needed. They really know their stuff in all facets of coach living and truly take into consideration, your needs and wants. Jared has my business for life as long as I own an Rv and as a friend after that. I can't praise them highly enough but they have my deep appreciation for the way they have managed my needs during this visit. I'm getting everything done from mid level body work to simple screw in loose panels. Wifi booster, Ota TV booster, leak in hydraulics, satellite issues, thermostat issues, major appliance repair, entry door lock alignment, windshield replacement, carpeting replacement and on and on. He does it all and does it expertly and with a carrying attitude as if it were his home.  THANK YOU JARED AND CREW VERY MUCH FOR BEING THERE WHEN I NEED YOU."
4,5,"I had what I thought was a major problem with my RV hydraulic leveling / slide system & didn't know where to go for repairs. I read a lot of reviews online & took a chance on ""On the Road Again RV Service & Repair"". Wow, that was a stroke of luck. I thought that I would have to leave my RV there for several days or weeks to get it repaired but Jared stopped what he was doing; came out & diagnose & fix my problem on the spot. I'll be going here for all my RV repair needs!"
4,5,Excellent company!! Jared was an honest and dependable guy. We were just passing thru Phoenix and had an issue with our generator. He was able to get me us in quickly and fix our issue. No nonsense and very capable. He knows his stuff!! I will absolutely be passing his cards around to all the RVers. Use this company you won't be disappointed.
4,1,"On The Road Again RV Service & Repair
I will start by saying that this is the first negative review that I've ever posted but am doing so in hopes of saving someone else this frustration.  And I am very frustrated.  We are full time and when the RV isn't working properly...it's not fun! 

February 7, 2017 I contacted  ""On The Road Again RV Service & Repair"" regarding my oven/microwave combination.  But figured while I needed repairs I would have other items done as well, H2O heater, awning motor and a seal replacement for one of our slides.  When I contacted the office and spoke with Courtney things seemed very positive.  We scheduled an appointment for later in the day and the tech even called to let me know that he was running late...still great.  

When the tech arrived I showed him all of the items that I wanted repaired so that he could verify that the work could be done onsite or if it would have to be done in the shop.  I provided him with the contact information for my warranty and explained that I had contacted them in advance so that things would go smoothly.  

I then told him what I had done to verify that the oven was indeed not working.  I checked the outlet, the breaker as well as plugged the oven into an extension cord to make sure it would not work.  I provided him with a print out of the specs on my current oven so he would know what was required. He did not open or take anything apart to identify the problem.  So I assumed it was a total loss and that a new one would be ordered.

Next the hot water heater.  I showed him its location and told him that it is an Atwood and that, from what I could find, the hot water heater would have to be pulled to replace the element because it appeared to be in the back.  He looked under the coach and in the closet to confirm that he would have to pull the hot water heater to replace the element. 

 We talked about the awning and the seal on the slide and he said that he would have to do some additional checking before he would know for sure because he doesn't work on the seals and didn't seem to know about the awning motor.

He mentioned a couple of times that I would need to be patient as they are busy.  I agreed, and then he explained that he would be off work Thursday and Friday but that I would for sure hear something on Monday.  On Monday, 2/13/17 still nothing so at 11:45am I called and spoke with Courtney who assured me the parts were on order and that she or the tech would call me back.  

Tuesday, 2/14/17, I called at 10:00am as no one had called me back.  I spoke with Courtney and she seemed shocked that no one had called me back.  Apparently she had forgotten that she was one of the options to return my call. While she tried to contact someone in the shop, I waited on the phone for approximately 10 minutes and got disconnected.  However, she did call me back and she told me about the bad phone system they have.  Maybe this is something the owner should be reviewing as it seems to be a recurring problem.  She then explained that 3 parts had been ordered and when I pressed her for what the parts were for she said the hot water heater.  She did not answer any of my questions regarding the other work and started telling me how I didn't have to pay for the parts if we didn't need them.  She became very agitated and didn't seem to care to hear my questions or concerns and said someone would call me back.  I did say that if I did not receive a call this time that I would look elsewhere for help.
  
February 14, 2017, it's after hours and guess what?  No call... The good news is that while reading some of the other disgruntled reviews on the website I've found and scheduled an appointment with AJ at ""InsideOut Mobile RV Service & Repair"".  Thank you Dee Fisher!  I'm hoping for better results!

I understand that it is a busy time of year but a call takes a few minutes and common courtesy goes a long way.  If someone would have cared enough to return my call or answer my questions this review would not have been written."
4,5,"Ray was timely , friendly   very experienced  and most importantly he helped us process our claim and worked with our extended warranty co.! I would highly recommend him!"
4,5,"I was very impressed with David's and On The Road Again's customer service. They went above and beyond. They didn't have to, I didn't pay them, it was just the right thing to do for a customer; and that says a lot about them. 

I had some trouble with another local RV place and David went to that location to give me a quote and try to find a solution to for my problem. They [others] dropped the ball and David and On The Road Again team tried to pick it up for me. Unfortunately I was not able to use their service for this endeavor, but you better believe they are going to be the first place I go to next time. 

Thanks guys, it really meant a lot!"
4,1,"I stand by my review.  I received none of the aforementioned calls or updates from them other then the call I mentioned on Monday from Courtney and the call she mentioned on Tuesday.  After receiving the call on Tuesday, we no longer believed they were acting in good faith and went elsewhere."
4,1,"Unfortunately we did not see the ""22 other reviews that are not currently recommended"" at the bottom of this site or we would never brought our RV to this shop. I do not know why Yelp feels those 22 reviews are not relevant to the consumer because they are 1 and 2 star reviews and as mentioned, would have been very relevant to us. 

Like so many other 1 star reviews mentioned here, we had the same experience. We could never get anyone to answer the phone after several attempts to contact someone for a status of our RV. We finally ended up going into the shop this past Friday to see what was going on. 

We were greeted by Jared who was hostile and unapologetic for not keeping us informed after a week having our RV. He immediately started name calling and telling us to get out of his shop. I have never encountered behavior like this from any business. Based on past reviews and our experience, he clearly has anger management issues and has no business dealing with people. 

If the multiple 1 and 2 star reviews don't steer you away from this business, good luck to you."
4,3,"Not sure how to feel about this company. We used their mobile services. The first appointment was made and they didn't show, but we understand things can get busy. The second appointment they came out and didn't charge. Jared was very knowledgeable and answered our questions. We called a few days later to ask for just a quote on the parts and were told tomorrow he will check. After 4 or 5 calls between my husband and I we just stopped calling and still did not receive word. We are just disappointed in the lack of communication that has happened. We didn't want to form expectations that were too high, but were given no reassurances of if they could deliver on time. I'm sure if you go to their location and get it fixed they would do a great job, but the mobile services were spotty for us. I think we just happened to be one of the few customers that were lost in the work load."
4,5,"Excellent in every way.  They gave me a fair estimate.  They did the work perfectly, substantially improving my RV.  They charged me exactly what was agreed to, none of the bate-and-switch tactics that are so rampantly common these days.  They were courteous and professional at all stages of the transaction.  I love OTRA RV service and I look forward to having them as my RV techs permanently.  I highly recommend them."
4,5,I initially called On the Road Again RV and talked with Kelli who was extremely helpful at getting my RV set up for a pre-purchase inspection.  The next day I spent 90 minutes with Drew who was inspecting the RV.  He was very forthcoming with information for me since I am new to RV's and answered all my questions.  Was very appreciative of both of their help.
4,5,"Jared and Cortni are super nice, dedicated and talented! Quality work from quality people."
4,5,"We were traveling through New Mexico and we lost 2 tires on the trailer.  Did a lot of damage to the rig plus tore out our gas line in the kitchen slide.  Tried to find someone to fix our gas line.....after traveling up to Phoenix, was told to call On The Road Again.  Jar of told us to get to him ASAP.  We pulled up, saw about 30 RVs....never imagined we would be out of there in one day.  4 hours later, we were all repaired, and will be back in the fall to get the body damage fixed.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
4,5,"Had a flat and called a few different companies off yelp to come help. On the Road again was the only company that said they would be right on there way. Dave showed up 30 minutes later, changed my flat, and I was back on the road within an hour."
4,5,"Couldn't level our trailer so called On The Road Again. They got out here within 3 days, fixed the problem. Drew was super nice, found the issue with the Lippert leveling system and got it working again. Thank you Drew so much"
4,5,"Straight up and honest.  I have used Jared and Lou a few times and each time I've been treated courteously and with prompt service.  Their experience in the RV industry is substantial and no job is too small.  I asked Lou to do a couple small things on my coach while he was fixing something else and it was no problem. 
Affordable on site pricing,  one of the best parts is they come to you,  no more driving to the dealer and getting nickel and dimed to death. 
Excellent company,  I highly recommend them"
4,1,Horrible experience! Had my rv 26 days and still didn't complete the work . Owner was hostile . Took no responsibility .. not once was I called in those 26 days to inform me it wasn't done . Terrible customer service
4,1,"I would not recommend this company.  Our refrigerator went out Tuesday, 11/7/2017.  Drew, the mobile repair guy, came out and said that we needed a new refrigerator and would make sure the office would get on it right away because we are without a refrigerator.  I called Thursday, 11/9 and was told we would have an estimate by the end of the day.  7 days later still no word.  I've left 3 messages and no one has returned my call.  I'm taking my business to Always RV which has excellent service."
4,5,These guys are awesome. I needed help getting my car onto the dolly and getting it hooked up. They strapped and chained  the car and charged me nothing. Great customer service! Highly recommended!
4,5,"Family run business and all around honest, good people.   We needed a new radiator in our motor home which was a big job, especially since we're so far from home.   Highly recommend them and thanks to Ed and Jared for everything!"
4,5,"Came quickly to fix our electrical issues during a record heat wave. Then, when our old generator gave in to the heat, they stuck with us into the evening and weekend to ensure we stayed cool. Went way above and beyond in seeing us through to the end and helping keep our costs down. Thanks to their entire team for rescuing us - I highly recommend them!"
4,5,We know jared and his family for years .Jared is a hard worker doing a great job to help all his customers get back on the road again as quickly as possible at a fair price.
4,5,"On the Road Again saved me thousands of dollars that La Mesa RV in Phoenix wanted to charge me.  I had to replace the Atwood jack on my 2007 Tiffin Phaeton motor home.  I also wanted to add a 3rd AC unit.  I called Tiffin Service in Redbay, AL and spoke to the service technicians for both of these jobs.  They walked me through the best way to do the jobs and hours they would bill.  When I got to La Mesa RV (which I had already paid for to freight my jack for replacement) they wanted 14 hours or service; telling me 2 men do the job at Tiffin.  That would be fine, except, Tiffin would have charged 4 hours labor, half of 14 hours is 7 hours, where is La Mesa getting the 3 other hours.  As for the AC unit I wanted to run it off a breaker feeding into my 50 AMP and generator.  La Mesa wanted to run a completely different 30 amp line for the 3rd AC.  I immediately stopped La Mesa from completing any of the work and picked up my rig.  I called Tiffin and they told me about Jared at On The Road Again RV.  I cannot tell you how fortunate I was to find them as I was out of state to begin with.  I spoke to Jared and he told me he would do the job in the same hours Tiffin quoted the job and would also run by how they would advise the 3rd AC.  He took my motor home that day.  I met with Cliff one of the mechanics who ran through the 3rd AC hookup (basically they same way Tiffin would have done it).  I had On the Road Again do the 3rd AC, replace the Atwood Jacks with the kit Tiffin recommended AND I was so impressed with their professionalism and knowledge I had them to do my yearly service as well.  

As a women (who has quite a bit of mechanical sense) the minute I got to On The Road Again I felt I was treated and spoken to with the knowledge of how I wanted the jobs to be completed.  They ran through all the hook ups so I could trouble shoot if need be and I now can run my 3rd AC the way I wanted to, either on 50 AMP or the generator (which La Mesa told me was impossible to do).  I also was charged fairly and not for 10 extra hours that were not needed.  

I am so impressed with this organization that I will take my motor home from San Diego to On The Road Again for it's yearly maintenance and any major work needed in the future. Kelli in the office kept me updated on every step of the process. Everyone in this office went above and beyond with quality work and service."
4,5,"It was Friday at 4:00 PM on June 30th and we were headed north for the July 4th weekend in our 15 year old class A. The main AC went out and we called On the  Road Again RV service just as a Hail Mary. Jarred answered the phone and said he could take a look if we could get there in a reasonable amount of time. 

After an hour he determined that the old AC unit still worked was not recognizing the thermostat. He suggested putting on off and temp know directly on the unit and run the AC unit as long as it was putting out cold air, and when it finally poops out they can install a new one with a new digital thermostat. 

All in all he only charged us $279 and spent about 2.5 hours in total and saved our weekend. 

Tops in my view!"
4,5,"Had our 10-yr-old KingDome rooftop satellite dish go out.  Sent email on Sat and left phone msg on Sun.  Called again on Mon AM and Jared was online looking at King Company re possible repair or complete replacement before calling me to set up an appt.  I had ordered KingQuest dish on Sunday, to be delivered to rv park on Tues.  Called when we received the dish and set up an appt for following morning.
Jared arrived 9am and had the old dish removed and new dish installed on roof and up and running in about an hour.  Best mobile service ever.
Whenever we need any further maintenance or repairs done on our 2007 Tiffin Allegro Bus, On the Road Again will be our first call, whether for in shop work or mobile service.  Thanks, Jared."
4,5,"The Tiffin Motorhome co. Would be proud to know that The staff at On the road again RV repair & service are exceptional professionals. The lead mechanic and boss, Jared was one of the most knowledgeable mechanics  anyone I've experienced on my trips through Arizona. He went out of his way to make sure I was satisfied with their service. I would highly recommend them as a place to repair an RV. And I also saved on the hourly rate by not going to the larger deal-ships."
4,5,Excellent quality service. They go out of their way to keep their customers happy. They've done a lot to my RV that the dealer wasn't able to do. Excellent.
4,5,Prepping the rig for the long weekend and discovered a major water leak near the hot water heater run.  Shutoff valve didn't work and the space was too small for me to do a repair.  Contacted On The Road Again RV Service and Repair this morning at 7:30AM.  They arrive at 9:15AM and Drew had everything repaired including a new shutoff valve within an hour.  I'm a very happy customer this morning and highly recommend this company.  Thanks for the great service.
5,5,"I purchased a Blue Ox weight distribution hitch recently. As it turned out, it was defective. They immediately called Blue Ox and solved the problem. 

They would not let me take my camper on the road until the hitch was replaced. Even let me part it there while we waited for the parts to arrive. 

They even helped me level my camper and properly adjust the hitch so I could tow safety. 

Can't say enough good things!"
5,5,"Fantastic service and incredible workmanship !!
They are very concerned about your safety.  They allowed me to plug in my camper to keep  my batteries charged without hesitation. A very pleasant experience with a group of classy people."
5,5,I was skeptical if they could do a good job on my 2018 Audi Q5. They exceeded my expectation. It was promptly taken into their garage and done in less than 2 hours. Very professional outfit. I would highly recommend them for all types of Hitch work and parts.
5,5,"Because of Yelp I was able to find this location and have a trailer hitch installed on our Cadillac SUV. Pricing was extremely competitive and at the end of the day cheaper than U-Haul or any of the local camper/RV dealerships. As noted in the initial review, this is a first come first serve location however with 3 bays and an ample staff they are very quick and professional. I'd highly highly recommended!"
5,5,"I had JTI install a trailer hitch on my CRV today. They are first come first served, so I was a bit nervous about how long it would take after I called and they said they were busy but they'd get it done. I was pleasantly surprised that they took my car right in. The work was done promptly and professionally. While I was waiting, I couldn't help but notice how busy that place was...but the best part was how happy everyone was! They were the most friendly and courteous people I've encountered in a long time! It was refreshing to see everyone politely and happily taking care of one customer after another all the while answering phones. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Way to go JTI!"
2.5,1,"Do not come here. Their customer service is abysmal. I'm traveling through so there is time sensitivity to the service I needed done on my rv. And while I understand that they might not have the part on hand to help me same day, it would go a long way if I could be updated early on so I can make other arrangements. Regular, consistent communication - not too much to ask. 

I basically sat waiting, inquiring multiple times for an update with numerous ""customer service"" people flitting about and none could provide an update. Just one woman, Jasmine, who didn't seem to understand any sense of urgency. Of course I still had a $200+bill as diagnostics and no actually improvement on my rv. Thanks!"
2.5,1,The sales team is very helpful and friendly. But never visit their parts and service department. Had my fridge replace in their shop and my vent wasn't installed back properly. It disappeared on my way to camping. I called them up and let them know about it and they just blamed it stolen by someone who needed the vent. Are you kidding me? It was an awful experience.
2.5,5,"My wife and I recently purchased a Sylvan Sport Go trailer from the folks at Arrkann RV. Everything about this experience was excellent. Neil, Pam, Michelle, and Gord were all very supportive in answering  our questions and concerns. We are very happy with our purchase."
2.5,5,"The entire experience dealing with them was fantastic, we were extremely well taken care of after the sale transaction as well.  Will surely be back when it comes time to upgrade again."
2.5,1,"Winterize your trailer when you take it in for service, even if you drop off in August.  The service department will tell you it will be 2 weeks to look at your trailer, but then 6 weeks later after Calgary has had a week of snow they still will have not provided any updates.  Then once you do get your trailer back and go to winterize you will find pipe have cracked and they will take ZERO ownership for having your trailer for 6 weeks without updating you what so ever that they need your trailer for longer than 6 weeks so if you haven't yet done so you might want to come and winterize.

I have 2 trailers and every time I dropped one off, the turn around was weeks longer than what I was told, and I was the one who had to chase them down for information instead of them providing it to me after every time I trailer was looked at.

Save yourself some stress and go somewhere else."
3.5,5,"Nice !!! Awesome ! 
Lady from the front desk is really really nice with you. Stoped to get oil change done on my new truck and she explained everything detailed how the full synthetic oil works on a new engine. 
Really nice guys around my truck changing everything and asking for any additional services. 
I've done trailer inspection annual sticker and the guy even wiped out the spot on the trailer where I have to puth my sticker. 
Great experience with them and for sure I'll be back."
3.5,3,"For a place with speed in the name, I'm always amazed just how slow everyone moves at this place. Sure, they're nice enough and do a good job. But I swear everyone that works here was a DMV employee in a past life."
3.5,2,Nice job leaving a nice greasy boot mark on my bumper. You could've at least wiped it off.
3.5,4,"Great lodge, great people, helpful and friendly RV host, what more could you ask for."
3.5,5,Friendly and a fun place to hang out.  Love our local Elks Lodge.
3.5,3,"This is another really nice RV park.  The host site is on the corner and she's a real gem.   The sites are good sized and easy back in from the parking lot.  Each site has full hookups and vegetation between the neighbors.  

We like staying here.  The location is great and there's a lot to see and do.  The lodge is non-smoking which is rare but fabulous.  We usually like to spend at least an evening in the club when we're staying in the RV park.  We did that this time.  I can't say the bartenders are friendly because they aren't really welcoming.  Matter of fact, we felt totally out of place and didn't stay long.  

Some Elk lodges are so friendly towards traveling members and others aren't. We've visited a lot of them and they're all different.   However, like I said ... the RV park here is really great.  We're glad they have the park for us to use.  The RV park would be a 5 star by itself considering it's an Elks lodge."
3.5,4,"Another great Elks RV campground. They have 15 nice size sites with full hook ups. They say 50 amp although the site I was at only had 30amp. 

Lots of things to see and do in Boulder City. Good restaurants in walking distance, the BBQ for sure. 

The lodge opens at noon but does not have food every day although the beer is ICE cold."
3.5,1,"Very unfriendly and unwelcoming, very sad! First time as traveling Elks that we have experienced something like this and just a bummer..."
3.5,5,Always great food.  Welcoming members and a smoke free environment make it family friendly!  Call them and see what is on the menu for the next meal.  You will love it!
2.5,2,"For RVers

Good: 
Very quiet at night. Dumping station @ front entrance was well maintained & there was no line when we left around 1pm (check-out is 2pm). 

Bad: 
Crappiest wifi of any of the parks I've been to - basically non-existant regardless of your location. Provided Map of campsite & directions to space were horrible (we checked in after hours) - see picture of map & directions provided.  Made for a very interesting evening while we hunted for the laundry room in the dark hours after it had closed. Apparently, the laundry room hours mirror the office hours. Would have been helpful if that were listed on the map legend or even the laundry room door.  At $42 ($37.80 w/ Good Sam discount) it was a little too pricy for a no frills campsite w/ super crappy, bumpy unpaved roads, unusable wifi, tight RV spaces & no pool. 

Ugly:  
Huge overflowing garbage dumpsters & dumping station greet you just after the front entrance."
2.5,1,Was threatened by another camper 2x because i complained about how he parked two vehicles back to back so no one else can park in the guest or overflow parking area. Owner said she did not care how they parked. Probably because they have several lots and are long term campers and we aren't not! Terribly managed park little or no gravel on path ways. Not a sandy bottom swim areas as advertised. Staff turns off water based slides etc. For kids at dusk when dusk was almost 2 hrs away! Other camper asked why staff said because thats when i turn them off and if you dont like it you can go to another campground! No sewer and when you pay them to pump out they do it half or 3/4 thus they have to come back more often and pay for service again! Way too many issues- camping is suppose to be relaxing but NOT at this place! Go elsewhere please!!
2.5,1,"What a joke. Where do I start with this train wreck? They sent us to a muddy campsite. They never answer the phone. The ""general store"" wasn't open until 1pm when it was supposed to be open at 11am. The staff is cocky and rude. The icing on the cake was that at the little beach they had (that actually was nice) had worker there turned on the fountains with everyone there and ruined one of our campers iPhone. When we went to the main office they were cocky and told us that its not their problem and that a manager wold call us. Never happened. Grounds keeper came and mowed the grass and Got grass all over our stuff and our food. Also the showers are gross. What a shame. Great property terrible staff. Not even an ""I'm sorry"" about the iPhone."
2.5,1,"Not sure what to say about this place. Stayed for a couple nights August 2015 during the week.  The place was quiet and almost deserted. The game room was closed the whole time and the swimming lake not usable, so the kids were rather bored. They never turned on the bubbler in the lake and the water was pretty stagnant. There was a huge football-sized hornet's nest at our site. I told the main office but it was never removed during our stay. We needed to move the picnic table away from the tree to avoid being stung.
   In the campground itself, there are only pit toilets. The one bathhouse with flush toilets is at the entrance, so it was quite a walk. Although my wife said the women's bathroom was relatively clean, the men's was not. On the day we were to spend in Cleveland, one toilet was clogged the other was overflowing with sewer water. It was pretty disgusting. It was after 11:00 am and they still hadn't yet opened the office, so I couldn't let anyone know. We left for Cleveland, thinking someone would surely notice. After spending the day there, we came back in the early evening only to find the bathroom in the same state! The office was closed, of course, but someone was working on one of the gutters so I told him and it was then remedied.
     Although the camping area is ""gated,"" once the office closes, the gates remain up all night--so there is really no point to the gates. Wasn't given a key card or code, but didn't matter int he end.
    There is a huge disconnect from what is advertised on the website and what you get.  They seem to cater more to the new banquet hall that is attached to the main office than to campers.  Will never go back."
2.5,3,I checked in here traveling across the US. Darlene Otis was Gen mg. My mother in law is a senior citizen. She fell sick. We had to leave a day early. We asked for a days credit. After careful review the Manager has offered to reimburse me for the night we had to leave early. I appreciate the Managers effort to satisfy me as a customer. Thank you
2.5,1,Ain't really nothing to do here and completely overpriced. other than that it's quiet and clean but that's all I can give it
2.5,4,We were driving through Ohio and found this campground and decided to stop for the night. Michelle was extremely helpful getting us set up with our tent site and s'more stuff!
2.5,4,"We had a nice experience here.  When we checked in, the site they gave us was a pull through (we hadn't requested one)  and was very narrow and the grass was filled with muddy ruts as if someone with big tires peeled out right in the middle! No thank you! So I went back to the office and she happily moved us to a back in site and refunded the $8 difference. That site was perfect with pretty pine trees right in front of the swimming lake.  I liked that the overnight area is separate from the permanent sections.  Not to offend anyone but permanent sites tend to be junk hoarders, so I don't like to be next to them.  I marked down a star for the disgusting restrooms.  I also think it's a bit pricy for no sewer on site, but there was no line at the dump station.  We will go back!"
2.5,5,"I have to admit, I was asking for a lot.  I called the day before Labor day weekend.  Cindy could not be more accomodating!!  Instead of hearing, ""we are full up, sorry!""  Cindy said, let me find you a spot.  We parked in their lot with electrical and that was perfect for me!!  It was their overflow lot and my family had a great time.  The park is well kept and has great facilities.  The store is very reasonably stocked and the staff goes over the top to help.  I strongly recommend and cannot thank Cindy enough for her hospitality and kindness."
2.5,1,DO NOT STAY HERE! Water is a major problem. It backs up into your rv. Electricity goes out for hours at a time. They do not care if your losing money for all your food in your refrigerator or that you have to make other accommodations because it's 90 degrees in your rv. They also won't refund your money even though they have totally screwed you over!!
2.5,5,"American Wilderness Campground is VERY affordable if you are looking for a rustic wedding venue. There was plenty of room for my 100 guests. We had our ceremony outside and the reception in the hall. They set the tables up exactly how I wanted and removed all the excess tables/chairs, per my request. They were very ""hands off"" which I appreciated. I would recommend American Wilderness Campground to future couples."
4.5,5,During our yearly visit to Scottsdale our RV developed a leaky shower fitting. Understanding our urgency these folks squeezed us in their scheduling. Actually the owner personally came out as all his technicians were booked for days. We are highly satisfied and would recommend these fine folks for your RV needs. Thanks for the great service and follow up.
4.5,5,"These guys are highly recommend for your rv / travel trailer repair work !!!! When the other LA Mesa people want to charge you a deductible for every different thing wrong with your coach, which can add up because its at least $100 for each thing wrong ! These guys at Arizona RV Service will work with your insurance company and fight for you to get things covered in/on your coach without paying a deductible for your multiple issues . They will definitely save you money and do the job right ! And you also do not have to send your coach to different repair shops because they do everything in house !!!!! Thank you guys !!!!!!"
4.5,5,"On my first visit I took a tour of their shop to see if they were the mechanic for me. Although their yard seemed a little primitive i was impressed with their tools and equipment. They seem to really take pride in what they do, have the customers best interest at heart, and are very reasonablly priced. I am very happy to have stumbled across them."
4.5,5,"We were tired of taking our RV to the ""Corporate Repair Shops"" and decided to try Arizona RV Service for a Furnace repair.  When we pulled in with our RV, one of our neighbors was there for service on her Mobile Pet Grooming Van, said shes been taking her Van to AZ RV for years and loves it.  Our furnace repair turned out to be complicated and difficult to diagnose.  Dan spent a lot of time figuring out the issues and repairing the furnace right.  They really stand behind their work and we couldn't be happier.  AZ RV Service will be our ""RV Guys"" from now on.  Thanks for a job well done!"
4.5,1,"Here is my experience with Arizona RV Service. I am in Mesa from November '16 thru March '17 with a Newmar Essex Motorcoach. I called AZ RV in late November to look at a few simple issues i.e. A torn slide awning, a sticky slide-out motor and mounting a new flat-screen TV in the bedroom. They scheduled Andy, their mobile tech for a visit two weeks out. Tech showed up on time and did a minor service on the Aquahot system, took notes and pictures of the other issues and left promising an estimate. I waited and waited and waited until late January with no communications at all. Finally in February I called and got a bit of a run around but finally was promised another on-site visit. Tech Chris came over and looked and took more pix and notes then left. After a week I called them and they said Chris needed more measurements so he showed up in the next couple of days and did that. It's now a full week plus and I called today at 11AM for an update. Was told they would look into it and call back. I haven't heard squat. This seems to be a theme in Mesa (see my review of Cassones RV today as well).
Apparently you can make a good living in the RV repair biz in Mesa without ever actually performing any RV repairs. Weird.
At this point I plan to just call every on-site RV repair company in the phone book and offer that whoever shows up first and fixes my problems gets paid and the rest can just go pound sand. Ridiculous!"
4.5,5,Had them flip the axle on my travel trailer and they were able to get it done fast and at a very reasonable price. I also got a few supplies while I was there. I will definitely use them in the future and I would recommend them to anyone!
4.5,5,"Absolutely great. Consistent and timely, as needed client communication, they try to do everything they can to get you what you deserve  and fixe what is needed."
4.5,5,We have used Dave at Arizona RV service to help get our RV in tip top shape.  He is very clear on what needs to be done and what doesn't.  He takes the time to talk about things and doesn't try to up sell.  If you find a price on an item that you want let him know and you can get it through him as well.  He does warranty work and also helps you to do the things necessary to keep ahead of problems.  We live in Fountain Hills and go to Mesa to his new location.  We have just bought our first RV and it's nice to know you have someplace to go that you can trust.
4.5,5,"I own a mobile pet grooming company and have been extremely satisfied with their customer service, knowledge, and patience. Thank you so much."
4.5,5,"Wow.  Just wow.  Tremendous thanks and praise especially to secret superhero Rob, as well as Sabino, Dave, Mike, Davidangelo, Dan, Chris and everyone at Arizona RV Service. 

How does one RV place in a state full of RV places get to name themselves after the state? By being THAT good.

I called from several states and several weeks away about getting my AC replaced because the places I was calling were booked up and it was time for my road trip to start.  I arrived at 9 the morning of my appointment and they were done putting on a completely new unit by 4 pm. 

Over the weekend, the refrigerator failed.  (I think it got jealous that I got a new cold-making machine in my life.)  I was still in the area, so of course I went back. They did everything they could to try to revitalize my 21-year old fridge, but 4 RV specialists with well over 100 years of experience between them, plus an overnighted part and a call to the manufacturer, couldn't save it.  At which point, Dave worked with me on the numbers for a new fridge and Rob did an amazing job of refitting my vehicle for the new unit.

But that's not what really makes this place great.  What makes this place great is the feel.  You can tell they are a team that has worked together for a long time, and that new folk are quickly incorporated into the fold (I don't think you'd last long here if you don't have the chops.)  It's a place with a real old-school small business feel.  There's light-hearted chiding and joking, but these folks are serious about their craft. There's a grill on the porch, and I can imagine them flipping burgers on a Friday afternoon.

While I was waiting for parts and the work to be do, and even when the work was done but it was the end of the day, they set me up with a place to stay onsite (with electric, to use that brand new air conditioner).  And the porch is a great quiet, shady place to enjoy the southern Arizona breeze.

And what's more, I never once felt side-eyed or condescended to.  I got appropriately through explanations of everything they did, and the entire time, I was treated with respect and friendliness.  That shouldn't be a big deal, but as a visibly queer and genderqueer person, it's invaluable.

The next time something goes wrong with my RV, I hope it's near Mesa, so I can visit my favorite AZ RV resort ... I mean, repair place."
4.5,5,These guys are great.  They fixed our ac ceiling unit and dash ac. They were friendly worked with our insurance.   I highly recommend them to anyone needing service
4.5,5,"Wow! These guys were great.  Andy is very talented and personable.   We were in town visiting in our '07 Itasca when our original equipped Norcold refrigerator decided to cough up and quit.  I called my Texas repair dealer and they told me it would be 2 weeks before it could be looked at. Hay! It's Phoenix and 105 degrees & no refrigerator?
  I found AZ RV Service on line and they rescued us and saved our trip.  Within a day we knew it had to be replaced, and a new unit might be 2 or more days out.  But no, the next morning Andy was installing the new one .  That night we were making ice for a price that will make Camping World sweat 
  Great job guys, you are our new go to place for RV repair in Mesa.
  Would you guys ever consider opening a office in Austin Texas??"
4.5,5,"Called them and explained our issue with one of the motors in our bedroom slide.  They understood our time constraint and squeezed us in their tight schedule; not only that, but they allowed us to camp in their property with access to water and power!
Early the next morning they determined the part needed and ordered it.
While waiting for the part, they also checked on a different issue we had regarding our water tank.  After making pertinent diagnosis, they explained to us the cause of the problem, showed us exactly what they were talking about, and gave us a solution and an estimate cost.  For this particular issue we decided to go to the coach manufacturer, since it was a poor design.

By the end of the working day, our slide was fixed and we were back on the road.
They were very friendly.  Great job from the whole team of technicians and caring employees."
4.5,4,"I owe these folks an updated review. About 10 days before my scheduled departure from Mesa I called Arizona RV Repair and stressed that the clock was running out. They promised that they would be here to do the repairs. They showed up on time and stuck with it for most of three days and didn't quit until the job was finished. The slideout motor replacement turned out to be a bigger job than I thought and it took two days of hard work to get the old motor out.
Once they were on the job, they did really good, thorough professional work. So I guess that my only complaint is that it took a long time to get scheduled but that really didn't cause any problems other than my stress  as long as the work got done before my departure date, which it did. So I'm up voting Arizona RV to 4 stars based on the quality of the work."
4.5,5,"My husband and I just purchased an 04' Alfa See Ya 40 ft and in the week we've had it i've called over 10 service shops to get quotes on fixing misc. things or to get an idea of how much time it would take to look at it.  I've consistently get the run around ('Bring it in, it's $120 per hr and don't know how long it would take...they make me feel that i'm bothering them with all my questions and trying to rush me off the phone)  We scheduled an appointment with another RV service to drop off next week and they would need it for a couple of days to get to the ONLY thing we needed them to do (inspect the hydraulic jack sensor paid and confirm what's wrong).  WELL Dave over at Arizona RV Service was a breath of fresh air.  He took all the time i needed asking my questions, giving his advice, acting quick to order certain parts so IF we wanted to purchase we had everything we needed.  He was flexible to squeeze me in at the last minute.  I think we found our RV Service Center for LIFE.  Very impressed and excited to meet Dave and Mike."
4.5,5,"I have been using Dan's service for about as long as I have been in business. I am a Mobile Pet groomer and rely on my van to function and function well!!! Dan and his crew have helped me out many times and then some!  They are all professional, knowledgeable, prompt and reliable and honest.  What a great combination! Although Dan has  a shop; I  prefer to use his mobile service. It is much more convenient for me (don't have to wait at the shop all day like I did with other places!!!) and moreover, I have given him the keys to the van so that he can access it when he needs to without my presence. AH! TO have him as my fix-it guy is wonderful and takes a load off my mind! Use him!!!"
4.5,5,"The air conditioner went out on my rv. An Arizona RV Service technician diagnosed the problem and suggested a new air conditioner. The new unit was installed quickly and efficiently. The technician was polite, knowledgeable, and cleaned up the site after the job was completed. We were very satisfied with the work and the cost of the replacement unit."
4.5,1,"Pretty obvious attempt to rip us off and over charge us for work that didn't need to be done. Staying here in Mesa and traveling from Florida we needed to have the rear axles seals replaced on our 2006 Hurricane Class A to safely move on the CA. 

From the moment we walked into the place it was a bad experience. I asked if we would be credited any of the labor time to do the initial inspection if we went ahead and approved the work and they guy with glasses who sits at the desk to the left to the left of the front door, instead of explaining to us that we would NOT be credit any labor time, he choose to get defensive and argue with me after I explained that other places sometimes credit inspection cost if you use them to do the work. I should have just left at this point..

We also told them on the phone before the appointment as well as when we arrived that we were pretty much homeless until we had the RV finished. Therefore time was very important to us. Not to mention it was 110 degrees and my wife and I we were on foot till it was done. It took these guys from 9am till about 3:30pm just tell us what was wrong and how much it would cost. I also had to call them 2x's during the day for updates and finally decided to go back in around 3pm to still have to sit there and wait 25 mins before they could finally even give me a quote. It was so ridiculous it was almost like they were making us wait on purpose. 

So here is where the rip off part comes in. I knew going in we need both axels seals replaced in the rear, that's why I was there. This can spray oil on the brakes and cause some contamination which I was also totally aware. However, to properly determine how much oil contamination you need to first remove the brakes calipers and Pads to see if the fluid has soaked the pads. They did NOT remove the brakes, or calipers during the inspection and then proceeded to tell me I would need to replace both sets of brake pads and both rotors since they are soaked in axel fluid which was about $1000.00 of work. They told when when oil gets on the metal rotors it ruins them... I guess they didn't realized they were talking to a 25 year performances/ race level mechanic that deals with hydraulic brake systems pretty much everyday. Rotors are metal and if they have continuation you can resurface them or simply clean them off with brake degreasers. You don't need to replace them and further you wouldn't know if you had to replace the pads unless you took the caliper off and pads out and inspected them, which again they did not and even told me they did not.

I also had a leak coming out of the back parking brake/transmission assembly that i asked them to give me a quote on. These guys told me the seal was not repairable and I would need to replace the entire parking brake assembly. They wanted $1750.00 for the part and 3 hours of labor.  

Therefore I left, very frustrated and was actually embarrassed for these guys. I drove exactly one block down the street and turned in to their competition. The next day they gave me an appointment. They took the calipers off and inspected the brakes and said the pads were 100% fine. They even took me out to show me everything while it was apart. I asked them if they needed to replaced the rotors (just to see what they would say) and the guy looked at me and said, ""why would you do that?"" I then showed the leak in the parking brake transmission assembly and told them I was quoted $1750 for the part and 3 hours of labor. He laughed and said who told you that, that's a rear transmission seal. We replace them all the time. It's $65.00 for the seal and $400 to replace it. 

The quote and bill form the place down the road was $2,270.00 less than Arizona RV LLC. 

Arizona RV wasted an entire day of our time, quoted me thousands more dollars in works that did NOT need to be done and the employee that sits at that right desk is rude, has very poor customer service skills and talks to you in a condescending manner.

And they charged me $55.00 to basically wast my time and sell me work that didn't need to be done. 

Don't go here."
4.5,5,"Arizona RV Service is an outstanding repair facility. Our A/C unit broke while we were on vacation and th staff fit us into their busy schedule. While we were waiting for our repair, we were able to see Dave and Mike working in the office dealing with customers and wrranty companies on the telephone. We also saw various technicians during our visit. We were very impressed by the high level of customer service they displayed. From securing warranty approval and getting parts ordered, to getting customers back on the road, They did a great job!"
4.5,5,"Arizona RV services saved us. We dropped in on them. They were very busy. Dave greeted us at the door,deep in paper work yet he stopped everything to help us immediately. Our trailer just needed a minor repair, yet it had to be fixed or our grey water would be free flowing everywhere. He checked out the problem and fortunately had the part and had us repaired in one hour. We added a power hitch and they had that on in minutes. 
 Here's where service went way beyond a business expectation. We had a new a  awning  and could not figure how it worked. Dave held a class for us, awning 101.
I wish I could give a star rating higher than 5 because they deserve it. 
   If you ever need help with your camper/RV and want fair trust worthy service this is the place to go. He made us feel like we were regulars, having had come there for years rather than showing up without an appointment like we did."
4.5,1,"Will not take my rv here again. Dan the owner and Dave the service manager were rude and could never tell me when I'd get my rv back even though I had made an appointment in advanced and a promise date was given to me. Promise dates were never kept. Took almost a month for only a broken latch to be fixed. Paid $200 ""diagnosis"" for a broken latch that cost an additional $37 for the latch and another $187 diagnosis for low hydraulic fluid plus $8 to add less than half a quart of hydraulic fluid.  Totally frustrated, angry and in tears with this place."
4,5,"My boyfriend and his buddy--skiers from CA--have rented through CanaDream twice.  This is my boyfriend's review:

We are extremely satisfied with the service we received. All prices were clearly revealed up front, with no surprises when we turned it in. I have dealt with Susan twice--she is a very nice lady and very helpful to deal with. I recommend asking for her specifically when you are in the office in Calgary. Thanks again for a professional and hassle-free experience!

(Susan--Chris and Christian from CA say Hi!)"
4,4,"We rented from the Whitehorse office. Staff were excellent - very helpful and friendly. All of their vehicles appeared to be immaculate. We rented a Ford F350 with a camper. It was well suited to a couple and teenager (our situation). The extra bed (the table can be removed to make a bed) was comfortable but would be too short for most adults. The main bed is very comfortable and fits a couple, including a 6 foot tall person well. The restroom and shower are cramped but functional. Our truck was a diesel and averaged 17L/100km - thirsty but not bad for the weight and profile of the vehicle. 

The cost of the rental was certainly limiting and would prevent many people from doing this trip. 3.5 weeks cost us about CND$7000. A few things were annoying and would be easy for the company to deal with. 1. The vehicle was delivered to us with 3/8 of a tank of fuel and we had to return it that way. Just fill it please and once full, everyone will return it that way. 2. Prepaying for km was a nightmare. We selected 4100km. If you go high it is a waste of money. If you go low as we did it costs 0.35 per km (another $550 in our case). Unlimited km would be much better for budgeting even if the average cost of rental goes up a bit. 3. The added platinum insurance package was useful but should also be part of a standard package. 4. We paid for a package that included bedding and cooking gear. This should also be included. Too many choices and add-ons made us feel like we were begin nickelled and dimed. All this being said, there were no surprises upon return of the vehicle. We had a cracked windshield and there was no issue. The screen door had a broken plastic handle that we had to pay for ($45 - expected since we broke it but there is a design issue here and I suspect they are regularly broken and should be replaced with metal handles if possible).

My only other suggestion would be longer hours for pickup and return. We paid for late delivery (another case of being nickelled and dimed). That allowed a 3pm return. Pickup was 10am. Lack of flexibility on pickup and return means a lost half day or more at each end of the trip (depending on your flight times) and the likely necessity of a hotel booking in town. It takes a couple of hours to pickup and return the vehicle. This is not a problem as it takes a while to learn about the vehicle and store all of your belongings (and repack them at the end of the trip). The company stored our suitcases which was great.

Overall, this was a great experience."
4,5,"Great service and friendly staff. There was a wait line at check in which caused a little bit of a delay even though i showed up at the recommended time, but the rep was friendly enough to make us feel comfortable and forget all about it. Great overall experience"
4,4,"My only complaint is that the pick up procedure takes a long time - about two hours. The staff are friendly and thorough, and they carefully explain how everything works and answer any questions.  We got the vehicle with 5/8 of a tank, which was a bit of a pain because bringing it back to that level exactly for return was a bit of a guessing game at the pump - I would prefer to get the vehicle with a full tank of gas.  

We had the midi B as a family of 4 (two teenagers), and had plenty of storage and room to move around.  The beds above the driving cabin were plenty large and comfortable.  Interior was very clean, beds are super comfortable (even for my husband who is 6'2"").  Stove, oven and microwave all work.  Note that electrical outlets and microwave will only work if you are hooked up to electrical power or using the generator (i.e. they don't run off the battery).  

In terms of the hook ups, I suggest that you wait until the tanks are nearly full, then flush them through, as the momentum of gravity and a full tank allow for better flow.  Staying hooked up can also be a bit smelly. We have rented twice and have never had to empty the toilet tank (we use public facilities as much as possible during the day).  No bad smells in the cabin from the tank.

We had the convenience kits - found the sheets itchy so swapped them out for our own before we left.  Also - just enough silverware for each person, so keeping up with washing was a must, and using utensils for cooking (like a fork or spoon) means washing or rinsing it before using it to eat dinner - not a huge deal, but I would prefer more flexibility.  If you are local, it would probably be worth bringing your own dishes etc as the ones they have are breakable - we prefer the metal/hard plastic versions for camping (and driving between sites you don;t have to be as careful packing the cupboards!)."
4,1,"Far to many hidden fees. We were 1/4 tank light on gas and they charged us $70 dollars.  The insurance is a joke, they charge you additional fees to protect the windshield etc.  they over charge you, they are not helpful at all. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  Definitely select a different rental company."
4,5,"My family goes sledding here anytime we head up north for Christmas. It's a massive park and I would like to visit it during the summer some time. 

While all I have done here is sledding, I know they also have snowmobiling, skiing, horse trails, tennis courts, hiking, and lots more I just don't know about."
4,2,"Stayed last year. Cabin dirty smelled like cigarette smoke manager gave us a free night and told us they were remodeling and to ask for cabin 8 next year. Just did it and were disappointed.  No fireplace. If you plug in the toaster you have to unplug coffee pot. The blind fell down in the bathroom and took out the toilet paper holder. They updated the furnature  to cute rustic wood log stuff but it's oversized. To go to the bathroom I had to crawl over my husband every time. The toilet ran and the sink dripped. Also they put wood floors everywhere. Not so clean and cold take slippers. You couldn't plug in the clock and the lamp at the same time in the bedroom because the outlet was bad all in all wasn't worth the 255 a night
Also the cabins back up to the road so you hear the trucks go by all night."
4,3,"Camped here over the weekend. Camp sites are super small and right on top of each other.  For being a campground on a lake, you cannot see the lake. All sites are set way back off the lake. Very little access for shore fishing. 1 pier off of camp area, one on other side of lake, and boat launch area. Heard from many fishermen that this was the worst fishing they had experienced here in years. Poison Ivy all around tight/small campground. Grounds/maintenance crew should spray this."
4,5,"I have only been here a couple of times in the Summer, but this is a state park that does it right. They have a full lodge, and also offer a variety of very nice cabins that you can Sleep in. 

They have sledding  were you throw yourself down a massive hill, cross country skiing, horse trails , hiking and much much more.  it was one of my favorite places to go when I was younger and one of my favorite places to take the younger cousins when I visit. There aren't it seems many places like this left in Ohio. or really anywhere that are free, old fashioned family fun. 

Its worth checking it out. 

Go play"
4,3,"I was disappointed with the beach. I had read about the goose poop littering the beach but thought that was something I could shrug off. There was none of that, but the water was gross. Natural, but gross and unfit for swimming. I'm not sure what it was, but there was a green, slimy, seaweed-like growth all over the ground that made the water murky and the sand like quick sand. There wasn't avoiding this growth from the shore all the way to the buoys. It covered everything. No one except for a few children were in the water; everyone was exclaiming how gross it was and some proceeded to pack up and leave. 

I sunbathed for a couple hours and left. If you don't like to swim then this beach is fine. Maybe this is a bad year for the beach, I don't know. The reason I didn't rate lower, is because there are many trails that I didn't get to do, that I am sure are great. We didn't get to hike.  I'm sure there are other great amenities to the park. The beach just wasn't one of them."
4,4,"Always a nice park. I went to see the birds.  Saw my first Oriole!  Went down steps to the beach, but mud was at the bottom stoop, so I went back up the steps to the paved path.  Great place to park and eat a bagged lunch.  Lots of walkers with dogs."
4,2,"Nice place to drive through....but that's about it. We went here and went on the playground which was okay. The beach is horrific honestly. Disgusting. The cabins look nice, I'm sure it's beautiful in the fall. Not somewhere I would consider staying just from all of the other negative things I have heard about this place."
4,4,We had  Hillside Cabin (4) with a great view of the lake..very relaxing location. The cabin was clean and well maintained. If they had more comfortable chairs to sit out on patio I would of rated it 5 stars.. they had plastic chairs. The dinning room at hotel seemed overpriced and not very good. I would recommend stocking up on food and grilling out. Our cabin had two picnic tables one outside by grill the other on screened in porch with view of lake.
4,4,"My family of 6 camped at site 199. We had 2 adults and 4 kids aged 4-7. The site's pad was flat for easy camper set-up and well-shaded. The map of the campground makes it appear the playground is very close. It was sort of close, but you had to climb down about 30 rustic steps (watch out for poison ivy) and due to foliage, it wasn't visible from our site (unfortunately). The playground is also right by the exit. There were decent showers with plenty of hot water close by and an area to get fresh water. The bathrooms were quite buggy but I think they tried to get rid of bugs while we were there (a 2 night stay). At the front gate, they asked our visitors to pay a $2.00 visitor fee. The campsite was very quiet and quite empty for that time of year. The roads were well-maintained and that made it easy to let the kids bike ride freely. We did notice - as did our guests - a high amount of mosquitos. We also got bad cases of chiggers after we left. Overall it really was a great campground."
4,5,"Nice summer day was perfect time to walk the grounds and the new boardwalk.  This new addition to the pond makes for a nice walk along the water from the manor to the cabins.  Lots of people were enjoying themselves sitting in chairs on the lawn, at the pool, around the cabins, and a party seemed to be at the manor.  All was very nice."
4,4,"This is a really pretty park, and it sounds like it has a lot of great year-round activities.  My visit was recent, in the summer, so that's what my review is going to focus on.  However, it does sound like they have a lot of great winter activities, so I think it would be worth a visit to check it out during that time of year too.

The manor house is quite elegant and situated in a great place to overlook Punderson Lake, which is not only beautiful, but also allows for boating, swimming, and fishing, and has a beach and marina to support these activities.  It is a kettle lake, the results of glacial action in northern Ohio.  

There's a nice campground, many cabins, and there are also rooms available within the lodge (supposedly haunted) - both in the original part of the house and in the addition.  Other summer activities include golf, disc golf, sports courts (basketball, sand volleyball, horseshoes, tennis, shuffleboard), and an archery range.  The summer also includes the opening of the nature center near the campgrounds.

There are 10 miles of trails, some of which are also available for use during the winter as cross-country skiing or snowmobile routes.

The Punderson staff is very friendly and offer some fun programming too."
4,4,I have been to punderson for 2 years now to swim in the outside pool. The pool is great an it cost $6 for senior to swim all day if u r not a guest but the bathroom is a different story.  If u plan to change to go home there r no hooks in shower even for a towel. One can change in the toilet area but always wet but there is 1 hook   watch when u walk in  it is slippery
4,3,"We were there for 2 nights, July 10 & 11.  We took young grandchildren, and their parents - 6 adults and 3 kids, in all.  Our campsite was up on a hill, so we toted all of our gear up some strangely built, but safe stairs (regular run, 1/2 rise, so short steps up on normal-width stairs).  Our lot was not very flat, but we found good spots for our tents.  The sites (2) were clean, and near a clean bathroom.  The sites were not delineated, but we did not feel crowded.  Most seemed small.  Ours were surrounded with poison ivy, and at least 3 of us came home with rashes.  The fire rings were clean and cleaned out.  

Sunday brunch in the beautiful manor house was disappointing.  $18.95 for adults and $16.95 for kids under 12. The first time I asked, my 2-year-old grandson's brunch was going to cost us the full kids price.  The second time I called, to see if kids could eat off of the regular breakfast menu (not during brunch), I was told that under 4 eat free.  The brunch is not equal to the cost. I have eaten here intermittently for the last 20 years, and previously, the food has been stellar.  This time, there was no carving station, but some sort of hot rice dish and some green beans, salad, and then all breakfast items.  The consensus of our group was the deserts were attractive, but did not taste well-prepared (eg. the cheesecake was not creamy) - even the kids left some behind.  Our table was cleared infrequently, but our server did check on our other needs often.  I had an omelet that was going to be brought out to the table when completed, and after I asked about it 20 minutes later, it was found on a side table, still warm, but not hot.  

I would recommend Geneva State Park over Punderson, at this point.  Neither have hiking trails of any significance, but Geneva is on Lake Erie and the food is better."
4,4,"This is a ""car camping"" park - you will be camping 20 feet from where you park. But that's not necessarily a bad thing - the camping area is barely used in the fall and winter. It gets busy during the typical weekends... Memorial Day, July 4th, etc. Typically during the week (mon-thurs) the place will hardly have anybody there. They just upgraded a bunch of sites by the water with larger parking pads, picnic tables and a variety that are wheelchair accessible. If you go in winter, they close the upper section, but there are still plenty of spots to pick from. I haven't found the perfect spot yet, but here are my recommendations:

1. Look at an overhead map before you go... a section of the lower camping area backs up close to Rte 44. When I walk there in the mornings, the traffic can be a bit loud.

2. If you have a camper or big RV, there are tons of places for you. If possible, pick the updated spots on the water in the lower camping area. BUT, there is a water pump house toward the end of that aisle along with a couple group camping sites, so I would steer clear of the end. They also have electric hook up at the sites and a dump station on your way out.

3. In the summer there are plenty of bathrooms. In the winter, they only keep one open in the lower section. I have seen complaints about the bathrooms stating that they are old. What's to complain about? They are normal bathrooms (not outhouses with a hole), they are heated in the winter and they have showers. So if this is your idea or roughing it, just put on a pair of flip flops and you'll be fine.

4. They rent bikes, cornhole, frisbee golf and the check-in office has a variety of small items for sale. There is a nice playset and I'm pretty sure they do an outdoor movie on the weekends, but don't quote me (check their schedule).

5. Even though the campsites are close, there are tons of them so you should be able to get some privacy if you look around for an out of the way spot."
4,5,"I have only visited in the winter. Although, judging by the website, there is even more stuff to do in the summer. 

For me, Punderson= sledding. This is what parents meant when they used to say ""Go outside and play."" You know, before America turned fat. 
It's not exercise if its fun. Then it's called ""Play"". 

Come and play at Pundersons. They have snowmobiling, sledding, skiing... all kinds of things to do. See for yourself. 

Oh, and the hot chocolate in the building by the sledding is really good."
4,5,"We've stayed here twice in the summer and had a lovely time. The manor house is beautiful and well kept. The dinner room is very nice and the menu good. The rooms are large and well appointed. My only regret is not having enough time to participate in more activities on the property, which include hiking trails, boating, swimming and more. It was a lovely stay and we hope to stay there again."
3.5,1,I took my 30 year-old travel trailer here when I first bought it and they were so ready to overcharge me for repairs that I later learned it did not need that I got out of there as quickly as I could. I'm grateful I listened to my intuition and went elsewhere. I would not recommend them to anyone.
3.5,5,"I was told the my RV had a blown head gasket, I was frantic and they mechanic i spoke with didn't really rub me the right way in Payson. So I had it towed back to Mesa and had Mike with Gene's RV take a look. I am SO glad I did, Mike thoroughly explained it was (thankfully not a blown head gasket). They were easy on my pocket, fixed it in a reasonable amount of time and even let me pick it up on the weekend. Now my Bounder runs like a champ I look forward to all my maintenance routines being done there."
3.5,3,"We love Mike, the chief technician and Mike's mom who works in the back of the shop is always very nice and helpful.  Watch out for the front desk person, Mary, though.  She is going to answer my every question with a ""no"" right off the bat.  If you ask around (I.e., Mike or his mom) you will probably get a more favorable (and pleasant) response and experience.

We not only recommend Gene's shop, we also store our rig with them.  Which makes Mary's attitude that much more distasteful.

Long story, short - their work is great, their technicians are excellent....their front desk customer service is awful, so just know that going in."
3.5,5,"Our fridge stopped working in our brand new trailer while camped in Mesa. After calling many RV repair companies, we are able to book Gene to come to our campsite to do the repair. Very friendly lady took our call and set up the appointment for the next day and provided a 4 hour window. Gene called the next morning to confirm and arrived early. He diagnosed the problem in 10 min and made a temporary repair while the required part was on order. A few days later Gene called and returned with the part to compete the work. Very friendly, knowledgeable person who completed the work as promised."
3.5,2,"Unfortunately, my experience with Gene's RV was not a pleasant one.  They did not properly repair my RV and did not communicate well at all.  If you are looking for basic AC repair and simple maintenance, they are probably fine, but beyond that, I do not recommend.  Here's the details.

I dropped off my RV because the ABS Light was on, the Service Engine Soon light was on and my converter wasn't working.  I also needed the slide lubricated so that it would slide in and out without stalling.

They started work on my RV two days after I dropped it off.  That was nice to see.  They did a good job fixing the converter and lubricating the slide.  No complaints.

Mike said he did not have the equipment to read the ABS Code.  He was trying to get one, but wasn't able to.  We decided that it was not something I needed worked on at this point.  It was an intermittent problem and I could deal with it later.  No complaints, but it would have been nice if they had the proper tools.  OK, minor complaint.

They found a valve had gone bad and replaced it to fix the Service Engine Soon problem.  They tested it and called me to come get the RV.  Price was fair for the work done.  At that point, I was happy with their work.  But...

The Service Engine Soon light came on about 1/2 mile after leaving their shop.  I turned around and drove back to the shop to see what the problem was.  At that point, the service I received was very different.  It was like they had my money and just wanted me to go away.  After asking several times that they check the code again to see if it was the same thing, they finally did.  It was the same code as before.  They said I could leave it and they would look at it the following week or I could drive it home.  The one mechanic said that the light didn't matter anyway, the RV drove the same and it was just an emission problem.

I asked that they look into it.  I lost a tire a few months ago and thought it might have damaged the fuel line.  They said they would look at it and let me know.  From that point forward, I received no communication.  They never looked at my RV.  Again, it was like they didn't want to be bothered.  After two weeks, I gave up and picked up my RV.  I was offered no apology and the explanation I was given was that they couldn't get a hold of the equipment to read the ABS Code.  Which wasn't what I had returned the RV for.

In summary, I think that they are probably fine for AC Repair and basic problems.  But unfortunately, for me, I came away knowing that I would not be using their service's again."
3.5,1,"I am writing the review in hopes that others will not experience the same horrible situation as I did.  I wish to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the customer service, equipment service and the dealings I experienced with Gene's RV of Mesa, AZ.  I will explain the events leading up to this review.  I had a driver's side, front tire blow out, on my 1996 36' class A, which caused extensive damage to the exposed electrical wiring, driver side wheel well floor, the front basement, as well as damaged front and rear fiberglass bodywork. Not being familiar with RV service in the valley I relied on the insurance adjustor for guidance for possible repair facilities.  They highly recommended two companies. So I began the lengthy process of obtaining estimates for the repairs based on the recommendations. This was not a simple process to say the least, as I am sure many of you are already aware.  I made it clear to each of the two companies recommended, that customer service and communications was imperative and was utmost on my list.  Neither of the companies heeded my request and concerns and I was forced to find another company to do the repairs. After a lengthy internet search, I found Gene's RV, contacted them, and received an estimate for the repairs. It appeared to be fair and in line with the previous estimates.  After discussing my previous negative experiences, I felt comfortable with taking it to Gene's for the repairs.  Upon arrival, 15 minutes prior the pre-arranged time, which was 1700 mid-week, to drop the unit off, the service tech was not there as he stated.  The person at the counter contacted him by phone and he could not return for 30-45 minutes.  I heard him tell the counter person, he was in the shower, I was told he was on a service call.  I should have taken the cue and just left to find another shop.  Let me also state, I was not in any hurry to get the repairs done, so they had 3-4 weeks to perform the work. I left the unit and a few weeks past. I contacted them regarding the status, due I was wanting to use it for the weekend and was wondering if it was road worthy. They replied that it was and I could come get it, which I did. I paid for the work done to date and left.  During the time I had it, which was two days, I found that the electrical was not completed, as I was told and still had various items which need attention. I made a verbal list and presented it to Dave to follow up after we dropped it off the second time. A few weeks passed and I contacted Dave to see if the work was completed.   I was informed it was completed a week prior and if I had received a call from Gene's informing me of such.  I responded that I had not and was going to come get it. Upon my arrival I went to the desk to get the keys and pay for the added work I asked for. The pre-arranged amount for the added work was $225.00 and was expecting to pay that amount plus the amount remaining on the original work order. I was shocked to find out the bill was over twice that amount. When I questioned the counter person, his response was he didn't know or have any idea. He contacted Dave, who was again not present and Dave informed me that the amount charged was based entirely on the estimate and that is what was owed, PERIOD! There was no discussion or reasoning, pay the bill or they keep the unit.  I paid the bill and left. Upon exiting, the original electrical was still not correct, the added requests were not complete and I was billed twice for items.
During this entire fiasco, I was informed that Dave works for Gene's as a consultant not an employee. The initial service tech I talked to was Mike and he was never there or responded after the first time when he was in the shower. No one from Gene's has ever contacted me until I contacted them to inquire about status  
I may be mistaken by what an estimate is but my understanding it is an itemization of labor and materials to perform a specific scope of work. It is based on proposed/estimated time and materials used and with a reasonable amount for profit and overhead added. It is not an invoice or billing statement. If the actual amount of labor and/or material is over or under than the owner is informed and a decision is made as to whether to proceed, and if it is under than a credit is due. This was not the case with Gene's RV. I was charged what was listed on the estimate and more and some of the items I was over charged and even charge twice for items.
I would not recommend this company for any type of service or repairs on any type of RV. I understand they have contracted repairing/replacing AC units on ambulances and that is where they should focus their attention, not on RV's. They may be adequate for making service calls to camp sites to fix AC units, refrigerators or other non-major items but they certainly are not capable of doing major repairs.
I hope this review will assist others in making a decision regarding using Gene's RV for RV repairs."
3.5,4,"They did a great job on roof resealing, replacing damaged connector cable, redo brake wirings and inspection reports. 
Their repairs cost me less than other big names' RV shops. 
Be prepared to wait up to 2 months before RV is ready to be picked up especially with a family business but good savings on repairs costs. 
You need to call them occasionally for follow up on repairs otherwise stay in dark till it is ready to be picked up. 
I will bring my RV trailer back for other repairs in near future when I do not plan camping for a few months."
3.5,5,This place had the better reviews so we chose them to inspect and make minor repairs to our fifth-wheel RV before our next adventure. The front desk ladies were very pleasant and helpful. The work was performed as promised and priced as promised. They will from now on be our RV Service Center in the East Valley AZ area.
3.5,5,"They were able to come to our site within 48 hours. Gene was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. We had an electrical issue which he was able isolate, diagnose and complete the repair. The charges were reasonable. We couldn't be happier with the service provided. Highly recommend this company."
3.5,5,"Family owned business. Their mobile repair business is fantastic, we were needing to leave the following morning, Gene's sons stuck with it, repairing our slide, working till about 19:00....excellent job at a reasonable price. The also except extended service insurance."
3.5,1,"This is only on Customer service and the front office staff.   We unfortunately never got the chance to use their repair service due to them.

I had called for a at home service call for my 5th wheel due to a backed up toilet.   When I called I explained the situation to the staff and what the problem was.   They asked if the black tank was empty which it was and scheduled the service repair person to come to my home between 8-12 two days later.   

At 9:15 the day of the repair I get a call from the service guy explaining we would have to bring the 5th wheel to their shop if it was not hooked up to the sewer line.   I explained to him I had not been told that and if it was an issue I would have had my husband take it to our friends home and hook it up to their sewer line and have it ready to be serviced.   But due the front office staff not explaining this to me I did not have the ability to move it since my husband is now out of town.   

He did say I could take it into their shop (which is 20 miles away) and they could service it there.   I explained I had no way to take it there. 

If their front office staff would have been more informative I would have had the trailer ready so it could have been serviced.  I also never got an apology for their error"
3.5,5,"Gene's RV & AC Repair replaced my home AC unit.  They were less expensive than the other quotes I got, installed the day after I gave them the OK, cleaned up after themselves, and there were no 'hidden charges' when they gave me the final invoice and they didn't try to upsell me on gadgets I didn't need.  They handled the warranty registration for me and it was a hassle free experience."
3.5,5,"Cannot say enough good about this man and his business!  We needed help getting our RV road worthy and missed a couple of important issues. First, I spoke to Destinee who quickly got me scheduled for a visit and poof, our back up camera worked.  Fast forward to yesterday, I picked up the RV after having GPS installed. Unbeknownst to me, the information I needed to activate the GPS was on the back of the NOW INSTALLED unit!  The only way to retrieve the numbers was to pull the GPS!!!!
Sigh, so I call, feeling stupid and lighter in cash.....OK, Destinee, blah, blah, blah.......POOF AGAIN!!!!!  Destinee texted the numbers I needed because that wonderful man, Gene, had taken a picture before he installed it!  Talk about guardian angels!
Suffice to say, we are customers for life!!!!

1,1,"Please be aware that if you submit the reservation form on their website you are not just checking for availability, you will be locked in and not be able to cancel your rental without losing the $200 deposit, even if you cancel the same day with months of notice. The problem is that they are not willing to provide you with information or availability over the phone and always direct you to the website. Their ad on craigslist indicates that you pay only $350 and another $50 fee for a weekend rental. They add an additional service fee and sales tax onto that total. They are disorganized, their customer service is terrible and the company representatives with which I communicated (with via email and phone) were abrupt and not helpful. I do not recommend this company."
1,1,"WARNING... Do  not use this company for a fun RV weekend.  Don't even bother calling their office (especially the Mesa office )  A condescending idiot will pick up the phone and not bother to answer a single one of your questions. He was even chuckling as he kept repeating himself over and over and over... Wow.  All he'll tell you is to go to the website look at everything and handle things that way.  They're not interested what so ever in helping their customers find the right RV/trailer or whatever else they might need that they offer there. 

Stay away..."
1,1,"Read their contract before you give them your credit card. You are responsible for almost everything that goes wrong with the vehicle. You are taking the vehicle in ""as is condition"". You can't pick the vehicle up until after 3:00pm and you are charged for the full day of usage. The guy who answered the phone was rude. He told me to complete the application online to get a price quote. The problem...you have to give them your credit card to get a price quote which means you have already paid for the RV.The contract doesn't tell you that after a 100 miles a day you will be paying .50 a mile. Find another place to rent from"
3.5,5,I cannot say enough good things about Robert and ISSCO Generators.  I originally contacted another company to look at my toy hauler generator and the guy had no clue what he was doing.  Robert definitely knows his stuff when it comes to generators.  He was able to identify the problem quickly and got it fixed at an affordable rate.  I would not hesitate to use him again and would highly recommend him to anyone in need of repair work.
3.5,1,This guy is not trust worth!!!!!! I DO NOT recommend his services. In fact if he ever contacted me I would call the police!
3.5,5,"I highly recommend Issco Generator for any RV generator service repair. Robert was extremely knowledgeable and his prices were Fair. Robert took on the RV generator repair task, which was not easy, and completed it in a timely manner. No pun intended but I am one happy camper. Once again, thank you Robert."
2.5,5,We were extremely satisfied with the service and selection of rvs here. Mileage was was also reasonable compared to other establishments in the area. Nyle and Andrea were very accommodating and even tossed in a few extra sheets for us. Issues which occurred while on the road were resolved amiably.
2.5,3,"The early pickup was ol. About 1 hours with introduction. The rv was ok and we had no problems with it. The service is bad. We waited 1 hour in line to return our vehicle. Just 3 persons in line waiting and it took over an hour with 3 emlloyees. The take it really slow and the manager is just sitting in the office while the line is going bigger and bigger.

Next time we will rent at roadbearrv"
2.5,1,"Eep!  It took us well over 2 hours to get our RV checked out for burning man.  I was also annoyed that they said some of our party could go to Walmart since the wait was so long, and then when we were checking out they wanted their licenses and signatures.  Dropping off the RV however was easy."
2.5,1,"Let me start that customer service sucks.  We called ahead and found out that our rv was ready. we get there,  sign in and stood there for 2 hours without anybody even acknowledging us.  There was only 1 person ahead of us that wasn't even helped.  We called the manager out to complain,  then they decided to work.  Returning it has been just as bad. Standing in here right now for the past 1 1/2 hours and still haven't been helped.  My fiance took off work early so we can return it on time,  just to stand here and wait all damn day."
2.5,1,"We planned our trip late and El Monte Las Vegas was the only company with available RVs. In retrospect, a bad sign.  
- Customer service: We waited 4 hours before anyone would acknowledge us about the RV we reserved. Others renters had been there more than 5 hours waiting to check out. While some of their team members are well intentioned, others sit around unwilling to talk to you unless your name is next on the list. Similarly, returning the RV took 1.5 hours. Add travel time to their location and El Monte ate an entire day of my vacation! 
- Hidden Charges: The RV pricing looks good on the web, but then EL Monte adds on numerous charges and set up fees. Worst of all: Their RVs don't come with bedding or kitchen supplies, but they'll rent these to you at exorbitant rates. For example, a set of pots and dishes that could be purchased for $40 at Walmart cost $125 a week to rent. A set of blankets and sheets for one person rents for $50!
- Equipment: before we drove off the lot both the toilet and the cap to the fresh water tank needed to be fixed. In the case of the latter, a locking cap was replaced with a cap with no lock,  so potentially someone could access and pour anything into our freshwater tank.  Pretty unsafe. 
On the road, the whole rig rattled and the engine whined up any incline. My kids named it ""the hunk of junk."" These RVs have been ridden hard.
- My advice: book ahead somewhere (anywhere) other than El Monte, even if it's more expensive. In the end, you'll save money and your precious hours of vacation."
2.5,1,"Well, I am really disappointed in this company. They nickel and dime for everything. Charging 7 days for towing when I'm only using the RV for 4 days. How is this even legal? Not renting from here ever again.
Just keeps getting better. The RV they had for me was 10yrs old with 117k miles on it. Not going to work. Now I'm having to pay more for the next unit up with no give from management. It was either cancel the rental I had or pay for the next one up. Last time renting here."
2.5,3,"It's a split decision!

My vehicle was well-maintained and drove wonderfully.  I took it for a 1400-mile loop around Utah, sometimes ending up on desolate roads.  If the car broke down I would have been hanging out with vultures.

Upon return, however, I ran into a couple who had mechanical problems with their rental.

The customer service is very inconsistent.  The initial rental was easy, but I didn't get the vehicle VIN until the day before (you need this information in advance to set up insurance).  The only reason I even got the VIN is because I called them, every two days, the week before my start date.

The check-in process I experienced was abysmal.  I waited an hour before I was served, and there was only one person ahead of me in queue.  The check-out process was smooth, but I had to then wait an hour for the shuttle.  I was told to not bother calling a cab because cabbies don't come out to this part of town.

So here is what I wish I knew about El Monte RV:
- Call them starting three days before rental date, to get the car information for insurance.  Otherwise you will drive your insurance agent crazy with last minute paperwork.
- Allow 2 hours for rental.  I am told the wait time is typical between spring break and end of summer.
- Don't pay for the bedding and kitchen utensils.  I was not told how much these add-on's would cost prior to arriving.  And once I found it, It wasn't hard to figure out that I would save a ton of $$$ by going to the nearby Walmart instead to stock up on bed sheets, blankets, pot & pan, and disposable plates / cups / utensils.
- Only international reservations have unlimited miles."
2.5,1,"We checked in at 2 pm but after 1.5 hours of wait, we still don't have a pre-reserved RV yet."
2.5,5,"Jerilynn helped us with our El Monte RV Rental! She went above and beyond and made our pick up and drop off amazing. Jerilynn mainly works at the Las Vegas Blvd location but went on over to the Boulder Hwy location to pick up our rental. Our rental was clean and worked great on out 2500 trip. Highly recommend! THANK YOU JERILYNN FOR BEING SO AWESOME! You are such an asset to this company.

2.5,4,"Rented a 25' class C in Vegas, and drove it cross country to Orlando over the course of 3 weeks in Jan-Feb 2017.

Neither I nor my friend had ever driven or rented a motorhome before, but the staff and instructional videos made it super easy. I did most of the driving (~4200 miles of it; we took a lot of back roads) and it was very easy to maneuver. 

A couple notes: renting an RV is not like renting a kitchenette motel room -- no bedding, linens or cookware is provided whatsoever!! You have to supply your own towels, sheets, pillows, blankets, toilet paper, dish soap, coffee maker...as well as your own coffee mugs, pots, pans, dishes, knives, forks, etc. El Monte will rent you these items for an ADDITIONAL fee...but we were already spending $3500 on the rental, so our budget was maxed out. They did throw in a coffee maker rental ($10 value -- woo hoo) for free, but we had to buy or bring everything else....which was kind of a pain in the ass with a one-way rental. (I managed to stuff most of it into a duffel bag and fly it back that way, as a free checked bag on Southwest...but we did have to just throw away/donate a lot of it).

Other than that minor quibble (and a few cupboard doors that wouldn't stay shut, requiring us to bungee them closed while driving), this was a great experience! We had no mechanical issues over the entire 4500 miles of our journey; the unit we rented had around 75,000 miles on it, and drove like new. The electrical and propane systems took some initial figuring out, but the videos and onboard instruction manual were very easy to follow and understand. 

Returning the rig in Orlando was also very easy; they come in, do a quick check of the interior and exterior to make sure you didn't break anything, and you're on your way.

If renting an RV again I would definitely look to El Monte first...but that being said, I'm not sure I ever will do this again. If the whole point of your trip is to rent an RV, then fine....but as a road-tripping vehicle, I'm not sure it's a value. The rental itself was $3500, but the GASOLINE is what really killed us -- we spent around $1100 on gas, and this was with $2/gallon gas prices! PLUS we had to pay $20-$30 for campsites with hookups along the way. If you crunch the numbers, it would be cheaper to rent a Prius or something, and just drive cross country in that, staying in motels along the way."
2.5,5,"This was my first time renting an rv and RVing in general so I have nothing to compare to but overall I had a good experience.  The staff was friendly and quick to greet us but they weren't particularly busy at that time.  Check-in went smoothly and relatively quickly.  It began with 15 min mandatory video on the basics of RVing followed by 10 min of registration and billing and then a 10 min in person walk through of the 32 ft class A motorhome. By the end of the check-in,  I felt pretty confident that I could tackle a week on the 1000 mile road trip to lake powell, Sedona, and the grand canyon.  The RV was in very good condition ane clean. The family had a great time and it was definitely more adventurous then air bnb or traditional hotel. At check out, our flight was scheduled to depart in 2 hours and they got us out in time to make the flight."
2.5,1,"Worst experience in the last 7 years of renting with El Monte RV. The online reservation stated our pickup would be ready anytime from 1-4pm, we got there at 2:30 and waited until 5pm. The front desk lady said you never called to confirm. Ok whateversss. Coming home the tire popped very loud, called the 800 number that was given at 2am, called the number back at 6am, they said they never got our message. Ok the tire gets fixed on our way home again. 
We purchased the normal RV insurance and the VIP insurance well folks, read the fine print this doesn't cover you on much. 
Checked it back in the manager was interrogating me about the blow out how and when it happened, then she said oh and there is a rock chip as well, i said I'd like to see it, they walked me out there, THE ROCK CHIP WHICH WAS A ROUND SCAR WAS THERE WHEN WE RENTED IT, I pointed it out to the lady when we were getting the RV, so the lady put marks across the windshield on our check out paper as there were small marks too. 
So I went back in and told the manager that was there prior to check out, she said how can she be sure of that? Maybe the marks all over the windshield that your employee put. Come to find out a scar or a chip get a different mark, how am I suppose to know this? Well never the less the windshield would have cost us $500 additional dollars and the tire that blew out cost $195 with tax, this came out of the deposit. 
The manager stated in your brown packet it states anything to the RV is your responsibility. The insurance and additional insurance is only if you get in a wreck. 
I told the lady we were pulling almost $100,000.00 with our 5 Harley's on the back, no way would we wanted a flat tire, as she was really interrogating me. 
Never in the last 7 years have we had such bad service here. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! We will rent else where next year."
2.5,5,"El Monte used to be amazing and I'm giving them a five star rating because they still have the best inventory. You can't find a Class A vehicle at their competitors. This being said, service used to be stellar and has gone downhill in recent years. Still, it remains the best in comparison to the alternatives and you will save quite a bit as opposed to purchasing your own and having to maintain it."
2.5,1,"Be prepared to wait a really long time...

I'll start this review with the positive:
Once we got the RV, it was great. No problems.

However, all the positives in the world cannot give us back the 7 hours(!) we lost waiting in the El Monte RV lobby. Perhaps if they had warned us when we called in that morning that there would be a wait (they said nothing). Perhaps if they efficiently routed similar customers into groups to speed up the process (nope, they didn't do that). Perhaps if they offered to call you to tell you your RV was almost ready instead of forcing us to wait in their crappy lobby (wishful thinking). Their lack of any sort of planning or transparency for a busy Friday was completely uncalled for.

But I wouldn't have left a review if it wasn't for talking to my sister today. She said she also had randomly rented an RV from El Monte RV in Vegas and also had a bad experience. A different year on a different day for a totally different trip. She had to wait 3 hours. 3 hours! Just to wait.

This treatment is unacceptable. If you can find another place to rent your RV, I would highly suggest you book elsewhere. And if you have to rent from El Monte, I wish you luck. Be sure to get there really really early. And bring a good book. And some really strong sedatives."
2.5,1,"The worst business practices ever. Don't ever rent or buy anything from these people

2.5,5,"We purchased a used Class C Motorhome from Irene Eckles on 6/28/2014.  We live in NJ and performed the entire transaction via email, telephone calls and photo exchanges.  Irene was on top of every detail throughout the course of our transaction.   Any concern I had about the condition, Irene ran out, took a photo and emailed me a picture right away.  Other reviewers talk about poor maintenance but we received a +100 page detailed maintenance log for our vehicle when we purchased it and I can say from my personal experience and proof that El Monte meticulously maintains their coaches."
2.5,1,never coming back here again!! waited here for 3 fucking hours! fuck this place I don't recommend this place to anyone. this place is piece of shit I'm fucking starving here.
2.5,1,"Very poor customer service! Be prepared to wait. The scheduled pick up time does not matter. The supervisor Judy Gonzales will change the words of their ""pick up policy"" so they are right. Customer is not right here. I would recommend any other rental company over El Monte. The reviews are consistent. The company should rewrite their pick up times to ""whenever they feel like it"" instead of 1-3."

2.5,1,"Disgusting Experiance! We were scheduled to pick up our RV at the Las Vegas blvd location. I called at 9am to see what time my RV would be ready for pick up and I was told 2p. I showed up at 2p and there was no RV. We were told it is on its way and should be there soon. At 3p we were told that the Boulder hwy location stated it would be best for us to pick up at the other location cause by the time the RV comes the LV blvd location will be closed. When we got there at 4:45p the Secretary (unsure of her name) informed me that they are filling it up. I asked about the compensation that we were told we will be receiving and she said ""I don't know, I'm just the Secretary."" I then asked for Judy (the mgr) she told me she knows that you are here. I found that a little funny she wasn't even in the office to know if I was here or not. A small compensation was made however not enought to even cover what we will be out cause of the delay.  By the time they pulled the RV around front it was 5:15p. I had to ask to bring down the bed above the cab while going thru the walkthrough and there was no mattress. We didn't leave the lot till 6p. Because of the 4 hour delay at El Monte RV we will not make our event tonight. We won't be able to get on the road till 8p after driving across town to get home & loading up. While we had our RV our AC was not working we had to drive with wet towels on our head & the guys had no shirts one cause it was disgustingly HOT! When calling Roadside we were advises that the closest location to us was 118 miles away and we would need to take the RV there to get it looked at. Upon returning the RV we asked to have Judy the mgr call us to discuss our experiance and was told she would look over the notes & contact us later that afternoon or the next day once the mechanics look at the RV. Well no call from Judy.... I called on Wed. and she had not even looked at the notes. After having a conversation with her I asked for the corporate office so I speak to them she informed me that I can call them but it will not change the outcome of our conversation because she is the GM and what she says is what it is. 
On a positive note... I must say the workers at the LV Blvd location Jerilynn & Stacy is amazing!!!"
2.5,1,"##Warning##
I rented an RV on the 25 of June 2018. It was my first time using an RV so everything wasn't unfamiliar. you first look outside the vehicle to see if there's any damage that wasn't caused by you. so I walked around and pointed out some scratches, nothing serious. on the 28 of June I returned the RV after I was using all of its facilities. when I returned the RV, the girl at the desk also took a look around the RV and signed that everything was the way the RV was received. they told me they released my deposit (1000$ when you take the RV). after a few days, I receive an e-mail from El Monte RV, saying I damaged the grey waste tank and that it was covered with duct tape. while I was traveling with the RV, I noticed the duct tape when I removed the waste, but never thought it was something irregular since it was my first time in an RV. and of course I would never put one myself. what would be my motivation - if I had an issue with the waste tank I would just call their support as they require, which is much more simpler to me than trying to fix something I know absolutely nothing about. so they took all the 1000$ for damage I did NOT do. I tried reaching out by mail 5 times and no one answered. I called repeatedly, and every time they pass me through to someone else and said the manager will get back to me. they ignore me completely and stole my money. no other way to put it. I highly recommend not to rent there. it completely ruined my honey moon. of course I plan to take legal action, but everyone also deserves to know."
2.5,1,"I'm writing this going on hour 2 waiting for my reservation. They ask you to call in the morning to set your pick-up time; don't bother because it doesn't matter. There are about 50 other people waiting here for their reservations as well and have MAYBE gotten through 5 people since I've been here. This is the most mismanaged place I've experienced. If you have any other option, you are better off doing that."
2.5,1,"The wait is absolutely horrendous!! We arrived, with high expectations and plenty of excitement, for our first RV vacation. What we encountered upon our arrival, was a slew of people waiting inside and outside of the facility. Garbage over flowing from the receptacles and on the ground(s)."
2.5,5,"Just finished my second rental with El Monte. We did a trip in 2013 and rented from South Vegas, this time from the Boulder Hwy location. I've seen the reviews from others, but I've never had a negative issue with them. Both of the RVs we rented were under 30k miles and in top condition. Check-out and check-in were easy and no issues from them. 

Jose at the Boulder Hwy location was so nice to deal with. Even though we arrived right before the 4pm cut-off, he took the time to go through the costs and vehicle with us in great detail. Such a great experience. These guys rock!

A word of advice: If you're going to rent an RV, it's like renting a boat, or any other vehicle. Check it over, work with them to understand how the systems function, watch the instructional video. If anything is wrong, be sure they give you another unit or fix it. When we rented the first time from them I found a couple issues with the vehicle that they fixed on the spot. Yeah, they should have noticed them, but you're getting ready to live in this thing for a few days, get familiar with it!"
2.5,1,"Do not rent from the Boulder location in Las Vegas unless you like waiting around and wasting precious vacation time. We reserved a rental to take to Zion in late July. My husband called them the morning of pick up, as instructed, and were told to come at 11:00. When we got there we waiting a little while to do paperwork and were told that the rv was being aligned and would hopefully be ready when we finished checking in. Well it wasn't. We were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait. Went to get lunch and came back. By 1:00 there was absolutely no update. We discussed and decided that if there was no word by 2:00 we would cancel and ask for a refund. We had our SUV with us and were fully equipped for ""real"" camping. We wanted to try an rv for the experience but didn't really need it. Bottom line - at 1:45 we were fed up and my husband told them we wanted to cancel. Their response? They don't know how to do a cancellation because it doesn't happen. TOTAL BS. After a call to their accounting office they figured it out and said we would get a full refund. Three plus hours wasted. Side note - there was another family there at the same time with the same issue."
2.5,5,"These people are amazing, must be a family owned business.  I showed up late and they stayed to get me into an RV and on the road.  Their motor homes are always very new, clean and operate very well and very easily.  I've been renting from El Monte for a few years now and would high recommend them.  You won't be disappointed.

- Philip B."
2.5,1,"Had a reservation for 1pm. There is a wait list with a 5 hour wait. They don't care about your reservation or their obligations to their customers. If you are ok with hanging out at their facility for hours on your vacation while they move as slowly as possible to get you out of their hair, this is the place for you. If you expect any sort of customer service of a shred of professionalism go somewhere else. What a huge waste of half a day of my vacation on a poor choice of rv rental companies. You've been warned."
2.5,5,"I recently sold my travel trailer and wanted to try a class C out for this camping trip. This was my first time renting an RV.

It was a breeze from start to finish. I booked in person ahead of time and was greeted promptly and done quickly. I chose to rent the 22ft Leprechaun. It was a 2017 and in perfect condition. 

I was impressed with the friendliness of the staff. I was kinda bummed that pickup wasn't until 1pm as I wanted to get on the road, but when I called the night before I was told I could come in at 10am as it was ready. Awesome! Pickup was so easy and most of the paperwork was done ahead of time. No issues during my trip seeing how the coach was brand new. 

I didn't mind because I already had everything, but I saw another review that mentioned this... you are renting only the RV. ANY necessities like linens, towels, soap, etc you will need during your trip are not included. You can purchase/rent some items from El Monte or purchase elsewhere. Nothing a quick trip to walmart can't remedy though.

Drop off was even easier. Just a quick walk around, some paperwork and done in about 15 minutes. I rented in February. I'm amazed at the amount of reviews saying the wait was long. I was here 3 different days with no lines. I'm guessing any complaints must be during the busy season like summer/holidays/special events because the staff were very competent and prompt. I would rent again from El Monte RV."
2.5,1,"We scheduled our reservation 3 weeks ago. My partner went to pick up the bus rv this morning and was told we would need to wait until 1230p, because they needed to clean and maintenance the vehicle. When he got back, he was then infomed we will need to.wait longer, due to el monte needing to change all the tires. At $350/day, not including fuel, the least the could do is have the vehicle ready. We will lose a total of 24 hours due to their screw up. They didnt even offer a proration of the daily rate. Never again."
2.5,3,Overall we had a positive experience. The staff is not super friendly but got the job done. It took us about 2 hours doing paperwork and waiting to get into the RV. I was told the earliest pick up time was 1pm but on the day of return noticed others getting into their RVs before noon. So just getting into the RV pretty much took a full day of vacation. RV was reasonably clean and well maintained. I called the help line once while on the road and they were able to walk me through how to keep the fridge running when not on electricity.
2.5,1,"Understaffed and incompetence. No one can make decision, delayed two hours as result. Find a different RV rental."
2.5,4,"Quite an interesting and mixed experience at El Monte RV 3800 Boulder Highway Las Vegas that causes me to write a review. The initial experience of showing up at the rental location to rent the RV was a complete disaster. We waited over three hours (!) to sit with an agent and do the paperwork (we waited roughly the same time to return the RV). Meanwhile, other customers were coming in whose RVs (rented at other El Monte RV locations) came in and were absolutely irate. They had stories of RVs broken down with non-working generators and no A/C in extreme desert heat. A couple of them really lost it and went nuts on the customer service manager. I was feeling very sorry that I'd rented an RV here.

However, when it was finally time for me to walk to the RV that we'd be driving for our 10 day trip I was impressed. It was quite clean (important to me but critically important to my wife) and in overall very good condition. Most importantly, it performed without a hitch on the 2,500 miles we drove. Also, while I overheard stories from other customers about being on hold for 45 minutes when they called the El Monte 800# with a question/roadside assistance request, the 2 times I called the 800# with minor questions the phone was answered within 5 minutes and I got the info I needed right away.

So while the rental pick-up and drop-off experiences were very frustrating, because I'd have to say that a clean, new-ish RV that ran flawlessly for 2500 miles is by far the most critical part of my evaluation, overall I'd have to go with a 4-star review with the above caveats."
2.5,1,"They are the most shady rv rental in Las Vegas. I went in to location to get a quote for the""ONLY"" RV in the showroom. They quoted me fo a much smaller unit letting me think I was getting the one in the showroom. I didn't find out this until I looked at floor plan of unit I reserved. I contacted the location and spoke with Sandra. She said she would speak with manager "" Judy Gonzales"" and someone would contact me in the morning. No one contacted me in the morning. So I went back to the location and spoke with Judy Gonzales. Which I must say in my opinion, has the poorest management skills I ever seen. I explained the situation to her and she came at me like I did something wrong . She said there was nothing she could do. Didn't try to come up with any solution to THEIR MISTAKE. You'd think for someone who was about to spend over $5000.00 , they would try to retain my business. I guess that's why they only have 2 stars on yelp. Don't waste your time or money with this company.
Sincerely, 
Jason A."
2.5,1,I was very disappointed with the very slow service for checking out.  They told me to show up at 1:00 but didn't get the RV until 4:00. I was not the only one so furious. Customer service during checkout was terrible and they need to do a significantly better job with coordinating logistics and customer expectations for when you can expect to pickup a RV rental.  This place sucks.
2.5,1,"First, let me start with the positives; the RV was maintained in a okay condition and did it job for the most part. it hasn't broken it wasn't needed any major repairs and got us home safely. 

Now for the negatives. and there are quite a few: 

It took us more than three hours to rent the RV, it wasn't ready. Even more than that, the guys there didn't know where the actual RV was located and they were trying to look for it. Than they spent about 90 minutes looking for a replacement for us.

Another annoyance was about the RV age. We got a 7 years old RV that although we love rustic - it's was disappointing. When we mentioned this to the stuff they said we should have paid the ""premium"" option! What!??! This option was never offered! 

Checking out was not fun as well they were understaffed and although the actual checkout was a breeze we had to wait almost two hours for the check out to actually start.  

In addition, we have tried to utilize their shuttle service which was just unacceptable service! They had a sign that said the shuttle leave at 9am and noon. We signed in at 10:45am and decided to wait for the shuttle (after the taxi gave us an hour wait estimate). The shuttle never made it! we had to book and wait for the taxi anyway ! 

It seems that El Monte have a complete disregard of their customer time. RV rental is not a walk-in business. They know exactly how many people are about the get an RV, and they should be staffed to handle their customers! 

I will NEVER rent from them again."
2.5,1,"I rented an RV from LA and dropped off in Vegas. Two nights only. The TV which we never watched kept swinging and almost hit my passenger. Upon returning the vehicle, they refused to listen to us about the TV and a day later sent an email saying they would be charging us for the damage to the TV that was swinging. 

The customer service was terrible, the RV itself did its job, but the after taste of this has meant that I will never rent from them again."
2.5,1,"While we rented an RV back in April, which had its own set of problems, Imagine my surprise when a charge showed up on my credit card this past month from El Monte RV. After a call to my credit card company, who then called the 800 number for El Monte, they were told it was a billing error and would be credited to my account in 24 hours. It was. Just wondering how many people are billed in error and don't catch it on their statements.  Renters beware."
2.5,4,"I've rented an RV from El Monte in Las Vegas about 8 times over 15 years, all for Burning Man. I've also rented from El Monte in LA and Oakland. 

Although there are bound to be issues renting something that is half truck/half house, I've found El Monte in general and the Vegas branch in particular, to be excellent to deal with. The vehicles are well-maintained, and generally only a year or two old.

There's a learning curve with RVs, you have to figure out how to drive them, how to deal with the internal systems, how to park, etc. It can be overwhelming for the novice renter, but that's not the fault of the rental company. The more you do it, the easier it gets.

I have run into a few problems over the years; once the generator kept turning on while we were driving, another time they forgot to put the glass plate in the microwave, and I had one year when the oven wouldn't light. None of these was unsolvable.

In an optimal world, you'd schedule an extra day at the start of your trip, take the RV out for a spin, then camp for the night and make sure all the systems are working.Once you get on the road, it's usually tough to come back. There is a Roadside Assistance program but most of my driving takes place in rural Nevada where cellphones don't work and t he nearest city that might have a mechanic can be hours away. Even when that isn't the case, if you rented the RV to get somewhere, you presumably don't have time for any but the most minor problem to be diagnosed and repaired.

El Monte's rates are pricey, but for that you get pretty good equipment and pretty good service."
2.5,1,"If you want an RV trip like the Chevy chase movie where everything breaks down then you will sure get that experience with this company. They gave us an old dirty rv with broken hoses for hookup , we had no heat, no electric power and the refrigerator door kept flying open and our food splatted all over. It was 40 degrees at night and we froze to death. . We called there roadside assistance and they sent us to a service station that could not figure out the problem They told us it would take 8-10 hours to diagnose . Since, we were headed to Moab we did not want to.spend our trip sitting at a service station. So when we returned the junker they only offered us $69.00 off. Mind you no heat, no electrical and most important I had no coffee.  This place has bad customer service and JUNK RVs. Hey manager get a clue if you want repeat customers and good reviews you should off offered us much more than $69.00. So with this review you will loose much much more."
2.5,5,"After reading some of the other reviews I have to admit I was pretty nervous about renting from El Monte, especially since we flew in from out of town. However, everything was great! The pickup went smoothly with minimal waiting, the RV ran and functioned fine, and while not new, was reasonably clean and well maintained. The return process was painless as well, with no unexpected charges at the end. We will definitely rent from El Monte again!"
2.5,5,"The staff at El Monte was wonderful to deal with. Although not my first time to rent an RV, it was my first time with El Monte. I highly recommend doing business with them. Will was the young man who helped complete the registration process and get us ready to roll, and what an awesome guy! We enjoyed our 5 nights in Death Valley at Furnace Creek campground in the 32' Coachmen Leprechaun and will certainly look forward to our next adventure with El Monte."
2.5,1,"I would be very cautious about using El Monte RV.  I ran into numerous issues, some of which I will dismiss as bad timing but others which I find inexcusable.  

-Pickup took 4+ hours (this is partially on their booking because they are centrally booked and don't take into account the volume of time it takes to get people checked out, still worth ticking down a star)

-The water pump on the RV stopped working less than 24 hours into our trip.  Their ""roadside support"" was no help at all so we were without running water/showers/toilet for the 36 hours.  Thankfully the site we were at had all the services, but it could have been very bad.

-The manager Alex is clueless.  The guy just doesn't seem to care about service.  When we picked up, he was hiding in his office letting all the other employees deal with chaos.  It could have been handled very differently.

-The biggest one is data security.  I used my Amex at two locations on my entire trip to Vegas, El Monte and the Encore hotel (to check in).  Less than 10 days after my card had been duplicated and was used at a restaurant in Las Vegas.  Given that the Encore swiped my card and handed it back to me I doubt they were the offender.  El Monte on the other hand, photocopied my card and swiped it multiple times.  When calling Alex the manager, he basically brushed me off claimed there is no way it could be his location because he ""runs a tight ship""."
2.5,1,This place has the absolute worst business practices I've ever seen! From the time the answer the phone and had no clue what they were talking about all the way up until I finally got frustrated and cancelled my transaction and RV rental! Then when I went to cancel my transaction they sprung a surprise $150 cancellation fee that we were never told about and the stupid lady on the phone had major attitude! And I usually rent from their sister company at Road Bear RV and have never had any type of an issue with them! I would definitely stay clear of this company and only use Road Bear RV
2.5,1,"STAY AWAY!  I used to love El Monte RV. You definitely get what you pay for. 
So the rental started out as we call, they say be here at 1 to pick up your rental. They have 2 people working the counter on their busiest time. I asked why the 2 hr and 45 minute wait. The manager stated I was lucky it wasn't 4 hr wait. After 3 hrs I get the rv. Start down the road and the fridge falls out, I have to turn all the way around. They have no other units for rent, so another 1 + hour wait. I get home hook up my trailer and their connector shorts out, no trailer lights. Another hr fix. Finally we are on our way. Get to camping. Sink is leaking, take time out of our trip and fix it. Then to top it off, something was majorly wrong with the black tank. Stunk like sewer all weekend. Bad! We slept with our faces out of the window. We had toilets where we were camping, so it wasn't even our feces we were smelling.  Their customer service is closed after 4pm so when I finally get ahold of someone they said sorry, should if called roadside assistance. So unprofessional.  I asked to talk to someone else, she gave me Direct Tvs number. I will so spend the extra 100$ and go with Roadbear or Cruise America!!
Stay away!!!"
2.5,1,"Tell me why do you need to make a reservation if you have to wait over 3 hours for your RV once you get there! The GM is a joke, he avoids confrontation, he allows his rental staff to deal with the angry frustrating customers while he goes and makes himself ""busy""! Its ridiculous! My friends booked their RV at the other location on Las Vegas Blvd, South, and had no problems... plus they said that the two ladies that helped them were awesome! Don't know if I will use them again, but if I do, I will have try the other location to see if they can save me from going elsewhere since I have been renting from EL Monte for YEARS!!!!"
2.5,4,"This was our first experience renting from El Monte. The online was reservation was simple to complete. We called to confirm. 

It would have been pleasant to know how long the actual rental process would be when we got there. Between watching the videos and walking through everything it did take a while, but we understand we had to learn everything so not a big deal. They seemed a little short staffed- we later concluded it was because it's off season for them right now.

The main reason my boyfriend and I wanted to leave this review was to praise WILL, our guide who walked us through the actual RV. He made the long experience more pleasant. He could have simply went thru the motions but he was very thorough and great at explaining how everything worked. Very friendly. Give this man a raise"
2.5,2,"We rented a 30ft RV for a 2500 mile trip. We arrived to pick up the RV at 4:00pm. After about 2 1/2 hours we finally got checked out and ready to go. Only to find out that the holding tanks were full and the fresh water tank was empty and the fuel tank was empty also. So after speaking with the manager he gave us a credit on the rental. 

We broke down near Denver, either transmission or computer. Whatever it was the transmission was slipping and it was apparent we were not going to go any further in that unit. After calling Roadside group,  they first wanted us to take it to a repair shop but after being apprised of the situation they convinced the dealer in Denver to swap us out units. Kudos to Lisa at Roadside group. The replacement RV was much smaller but at least it was operational.

After a day and a half delay we finally made it to our location. Now the new RV, we were told that it had been winterized but once we got to our location all we had to do was hook it up to water and it would be good. Not true, we had no hot water. After another call to roadside group, Stacey, told us  there is a valve under the sink that needs to be bypassed. We weren't told this. Also, green algae came out of the shower head. EWWW!  
Next problem, there wasn't a sewer hose in this unit. We had to buy one at Wal-Mart. Luckily we weren't in the middle of nowhere. So we get the sewer hose hooked up and connect to water to find out the gray water tank has a leak in it. They sent out a mobile repair to fix it.
When we were ready to head back, we went to fill up the fresh water tank so we had water on the way back. Well wouldn't you know it, it also leaked! 

Returning the RV was the best part of the whole deal. Jasmine, the El Monte rep was very apologetic and attentive to my concerns and complaints. She did give us credit for the days we lost which was nice.

Would I rent here again, probably not. Actually in all fairness, I don't think I'd rent an RV from any place again. These RV's are used and abused and not very well maintained."
2.5,4,"The staff were cheerful, friendly, and helpful.  Check in for us on a Saturday morning in June took about 2 hours start to finish, which included watching their mandatory orientation video, and getting a walk around/tour of the RV.  The 2015 RV was in good shape, we had zero problems with it, and it was exceptionally clean.  Checking back in on a Sunday morning took a half hour, max, with no problems whatsoever.  Overall a very positive experience and we would rent from them again.
Advice: the kitchen and personal kits are very price-y, if you can organize yourself enough ahead of time to bring these with you, it will be well worth it."
2.5,1,"Save your money, don't rent from them.!!!.
We waited about two hours for picking up RV&instruction.
We started driving, after one hour we realized how old is the RV. Kitchen doors cabinet started flying over on us, AC didn't do his job, fire extinguishing alarm started beeping on& off for no reason scared the hell out of us. Driving with family from over seas& little kids it was one of the worse experiences we ever had to go through! Customer service poor with no thoughtful source of help. Never agin ElMonte!!!"
4,4,Great experience with the entire team at Tom's Camperland in Surprise. They are honest and straightforward and will help you find the trailer that will best fit your needs at a reasonable price.
4,5,The guys here were great. They helped me out and got my the tonneau cover I really wanted. Also got me the bed rug at a great price. Thanks guys for your willingness to work with me on this situation. Clearer heads prevailed and we were able to work out a deal for both of us. I would recommend anyone looking for a shell or tonneau to come by and check these guys out. Make sure you ask all your questions before hand to avoid any issues.
4,5,Bought a small travel trailer from Tom's.  Matt was our salesman and was great...very no-pressure and helpful with any questions.  2 years later I needed help with a copy of the invoice from my purchase...Matt faxed it to me in no time.   Talk about great customer service!  And the trailer is great too!
4,5,"I recently purchased a 2016 Toyota Tacoma and wanted a shell for it, Toms Camperland of Surprise was my destination, since my truck was a new design there aren't very many choices for a shell, I went with the A.R.E. V series. Since the shell is made to order I left a deposit and in only 20 days they had it for me to be installed. They called me and I was able to go over that afternoon and within an hour had me on my way with my new shell. Now my dogs get to go with me in the new truck, loving every moment of it. Thanks Toms Camperland!"
4,5,"We had a very good experience with Toms Camperland. 
Leaf was our sales person and was professional and knowledgeable.  We purchased a lance trailer and love the quality and the size also floor plan.
We did have an issue with the slide out, but their service manager Dave was helpful and repaired the problem.  It was just a loose wire.  We have some friends also looking for a Lance trailer and recommend buying from Toms"
4,1,I purchased a used ARE shell from them and within 60 days the side doors fall back down. The props that hold the door up have failed. When I called and spoke with Jason my sales person he informed me that they are not covered by any warranty but he would gladly discount new ones. I specifically asked about them seeing as how I spent 850 dollars on the unit. Would  not recommend them. What kind of reputable dealer would do that.
4,5,"I've ordered 4 camper shells for the 4 different trucks I've owned in my life and this was by far the best service I've received. This shell was an ARE V-Series. The ordering and payment ($1,699.29) took only a few minutes, and the shell arrived in 14 days. The installation was only an hour and I was on my way. As for the shell, the color is spot on. Fit and finish is excellent. Tom's Camperland installed it with clamps (no cheesy nuts and bolts) and used a quick disconnect for the LED brake light. Thank you Matt for selling me a great product!"
4,1,"Cody was great,  he was getting me all hooked up with a control module and the install.  The manager came over and threw out a ridiculous price for everything after I told him that I've been quoted a price from another Leer authorized dealer.  He wouldn't match the price and didn't seem to care that I had money to spend there.  Worst customer service from a business I've ever seen.  Won't ever go back there."
4,3,"Be careful. Buy exactly what you want and do research before hand. They don't inform you that there are no returns on items purchased. They get it on your truck and if you don't like the way it looks, tough luck. They will declare its your fault for everything and criticize the new product you want so you shut up and keep the one you already purchased. 

In my case, I purchased a tonneau cover that was supposed to ""follow the lines of your hood"". In reality, the lines pop up 2.5-3 times the height of the hood. Sticks out like a sore thumb. I called them back 3 hours later to see if I can exchange. Nope. Can I return? Nope. The receipt says no returns on special orders, but says nothing about in stock items. Like I said, do your research before hand. I didn't and I got burned.

***update: Matt has reached out to me and has said he'll work with me on getting the cover that is right for me. I'll update more when we've worked everything out. Thanks Matt!

I went to Tom's and they removed the ""old"" tonneau cover and got the new one ordered. While there, they also hooked me up with a deal on a bed rug. Thanks guys! Can't wait to get the new Leer cover!
***"
4,4,"Such a great experience shopping for trailers here. Helpful, no-pressure, no-rush.  Salesman Dave was great. What a difference compared to our first RV shopping stop (see other review)!

I will update review once we actually purchase."
4,1,I contacted Tom's Camperland multiple times to confirm they have insolator covers I need for my ARE tonneau cover. I was told they did have them and that the cost was about $4.00. So I drive from downtown Phoenix to their Sun City location to purchase them. Matt at their Sun City location proceeds to tell me they dont stock them and that the cost to order them would be $50.00. As i'm leaving the sales office I notice employee's working and ask them if they knew of this part. They recognize what i'm talking about and proceed to give me 2 of the covers. My understanding was they had some to spare. As i'm walking out Matt confronts me and accuses me of being a theif and a liar. He then proceeds to ask for the covers back. I returned the covers and left the store. I've never been so insulted or mad while trying to purchase something. My feeling is my skin color had a lot to do with the way i was treated. My reason for writing this is to warn any potential customers to avoid the embarrassment and aggravation of dealing with Tom's Camperland.
4,5,"No regrets, today  has been  1 year  since we  took delivery of our 2014 Lance 1985 travel trailer. The from first  contact  with  Tom's Camperland to the delivery, everything  they  advertised about our trailer  has proven to be correct. Of course  how could you  go wrong  with  a Lance. Thank you Tom's Camperland."
4,5,"The team at Tom's Camperland are the best. We have purchased 3 RV's from them in the last 18 years and they sold our old Lance 950 on consignment. 

We just picked up our new Arctic Fox 811 truck camper and once again Fred and Matt were wonderful to work with.  We live in Colorado so it really helps to have someone we really trust to get everything right before we drive away with our new rig.  We can be certain that the crew at Tom's has completely gone over everything before we take possession. 

If we do have a problem or issue with our new camper Fred or Matt are just a phone call away and I have called them several times, once from Mexico.

Keep up the good work guys, you are the best !"
4,5,These guys are fantastic. I just purchased a used camper and everything works just as it should and as promised. I will definitely buy from them again.
4,5,"Outstanding!  Very pleased with my RV buying experience at Tom's from start to finish!  Great job guys, you've earned a loyal customer!"
4,5,"We have been very impressed with the way Tom's Camperland has treated us over the last year. They are very good at working with their customers, to make a purchase go as smoothly as possible. There was never any pressure to buy, and everyone was so helpful and informative. We could not have asked for better service, or a better knowledge of the world of camper/trailers!"
4,5,I came in today to look at the T@Bs and I spoke with Matt Duncan the general manager.  He was awesome!! I asked a million questions and he took the time & answered all of them; he didn't seem rude and definitely had patience for me so that was great. I am definitely buying one this yr  and hopefully he will still be there.  They were great; if you're looking for a tab or on rpod this is the place to buy them.
4,5,"Don't waste your time with the ""other guys"" Tom's camper land is the only place to buy in the Valley!! Best customer service, prices & quality!"
4,1,"We just purchased a Camper and they sent us on the road with Tie Downs that bent, a camper that moved inches, a Tork that bent and new installed air bags that leaked.

Their reply to our complaint was ""slow down and good luck!""

We drove in the slow lane all the way home on US hwys with Semi Trucks passing us.  This should have never happened.  We have since upgraded the Tie Downs and purchased a stabilizer.  Another company is trying to find the leak in the air bags.  

Toms Camperland Sucks"
2,1,"PLEASE  PLEASE Do not call these people to help with any technical issues with your car, I called them and a man name Don show up not the person i talk to on the phone i spoke to Mark on the phone, When this man Don showed up he literally looked like a homeless man and he smelled very bad and seemed not to have taken a shower in a long time, that should of told me right there i should of not let him touch my car.  I am so upset right now!!!  Not only did not fix my car but i had to pay 100 for nothing , spent almost two hours and did nothing to my car. Told me it was a spark plug , replaced the spark plug and still did not fix the problem.  Demanded i pay the money when he did nothing to my car.  These people do not know what they are doing. I might as well just thrown 100 dollars out the window.  Please im advising you with all my heart do not trust these people.  Accurate Mobile Mechanics are a SCAM! And are not license and are not certified. I give you no stars at all!"
2,1,"I am only giving a 1 star because negative stars is not able to be given. The mechanic that I called was not the one that arrived. I did not get a call saying that they were on their way; I was freaked out because it was not the same name, the person was smelly and dirty.  Accurate mobile mechanics sub-contracted to this dirty guy named Don. He looked homeless and smelled like a pissy old blanket. I asked for his license and he said he didn't have it handy.  He didn't know the phone number of the direct accurate phone. I called Mark back with the original # and told him the type of person that showed up and he said that he was working on an RV all day and he was his best.  Dirty Don may be the best but he was psycho crazy dirty, smelled awful and was not about to get in my car or under the hood until he produced a license....he could not. I saw 4+ bad reviews while he was trying to talk me into looking at my car and I told him to pack up his van that looked like it was in a roll over accident and get out of here."
2,1,I called to have someone come out and look at the crankshaft pulley on my car. It seems that the metal part of the pulley separated from the rubber on the crankshaft. I was told that he was running behind by about 2 hours but he would give me a 20 minute courtesy call when he was on his way. I never got a call back. I would buy a new car before having these people work on my car.
2,1,My first ríp off experience. Called they send a over weight old man limping. Looked homeless the van looked like junk. We had a bad feeling specially the guy smelled like pee dirty looked homeless I wish I checked these reviews! So I'm assuming it was this spencer guy I called to get my fuse box fixed he came to tell me I needed a new one no shit! And kept trying to say the same thing over and over again and tell us story's about some car just really noticing trying to delay everything so he hands me the bill I say I'm not paying for you not doing anything and just tell us what we already know. So I call the guy and told him nothing was getting fixed that I was not gonna pay for 5 mins of nothing getting done and I told him I called to get it fix and he hung up! Called again no answer! So I tell this guy ur boss hung up and I'm not paying to rip me off! No way! Start saying that I agreed I said agreed for u to do a machine doagnostic and to fix it also the guy also said i can go get the part my self call them and install for 260! So I would pay 150 for the fuse box 85 for nothing done but told what we already knew and 260 for putting it whichever bf could do in 10 mins said took 2 hours lol so I'm looking close to 500. That's when I told him I could take it to a shop and get very thing done for that price or less! He hung up then so this guy tells me they will impoundy car if I didn't pay! Omg! Now I know it's a scam an finally decide to call the police an he gets up quick and leaves mumbling right away! Guess wanted nothing with the police so i got his liscence plate  and filling a police report If they even attemp to do something to my car! Or try to vandalize it ... Evil ass people trying to make money with scams . Try to look up their liscence under state secretary there's nothing! Go on Google and look at the other horrible scam reviews. Pathetic ! I will not let it go and file a report
2,1,"I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. I felt so passionate about not letting others have to deal with what I did that I signed up for Yelp to do this review.

I got stuck during a timing belt job  on my Honda Accord at my house so I figured I should call in a mechanic to get the belt on and timed up properly. I call the place and the guy on the phone was friendly and helpful. He said he'd send someone over. The rate would be $85. That seemed fair considering a mechanic should be able to get some belts on in no time and I had already done half the work. A few hours later, around 4pm, an elderly man named Spencer finally shows up. He was over 2 hours late but he had called to say he was stuck on another job. When he first showed up, he spent around 15 minutes standing in the street talking about Las Vegas and wasting time. When we started looking at my car, he started asking questions and making comments that made me feel like letting him work on my car would be a huge mistake. Things like ""where do these go?"" , ""I'm a little dyslexic"", ""its been a long time since I've worked on a Honda"", etc. He then took about 30 minutes to set up his laptop to look up directions when I had the Honda factory manual right there. Over an hour goes by and nothing has been done other than setting up a laptop and putting some fingerprints on the car. He finally asks me to sign a contract allowing him to work on my car. Before I sign, I asked him how long the job would take considering he had already been there an hour and nothing was done. No answer. Instead he continues to look around my car and fiddle around with parts all while on the phone with some shop because he needs some ""part"". Ask again, he said it'll be a few hours. I had previously gotten a quote from a different mechanic saying he'd do it for $220 so a vague answer like that wouldn't work for me. We negotiated back and forth until he finally agreed to match the price so I agree to sign the contract. I was wary because he didn't seem to know anything about this car but he was supposed to be an ASE certified mechanic. At one point during negotiations he said,""I'd rather just take my $85 for the service fee because this is going to be a hassle.""(what service fee?!?!) As soon as I sign the contract, he tells me that he has to go get a part to do the job and that he wants half of payment up front. Weird considering I had everything needed to do the job. Also weird that he wants me to pay him up front right before he has to leave to get a ""part"". I told him that I wouldn't pay anymore than the $220 we agreed on regardless of whether he needed another part or not and that he would get payment at the end of the job. That's when he got mad and walked away with the contract I had just signed agreeing to pay $220. He muttered that I was making it impossible for him to make a dollar.(don't say you can do a job when you can't and maybe you'd make that dollar) He started packing up his laptop and van. That was fine with me. I shouldn't be letting him touch my car anyways with his lack of knowledge of the job. After he's all packed up, he comes to ask me for the service fee. I had never been told of a service fee and refuse to pay. Also, what service? All he did was leave some fingerprints on my engine and take 30 minutes to set up a computer. I told him he wasn't getting paid any service fee and that I'd give him $40 for gas. On the contract I had signed earlier, he wrote out that I had paid the $40 and asked me to sign. I asked him to cross out the part where I had agreed to pay $220. He tried not to at first but I told him that he would get nothing if he didn't. He ended up giving me the entire contract and taking the $40. 

The highlight of this experience for me was a comment he made to me as he was packing up and leaving. He said, ""There was a time when a man got paid for what he did, not what he knows. I guess they don't teach that in school anymore."" Well Spencer, you didn't get paid because you clearly didn't KNOW anything about the car you were sent to fix so you didn't DO anything. Don't make a snobby remark to me because of your lack of skills and knowledge of the job. 

Anyways, took the car to a different mechanic and got it done. Funny how this mechanic didn't need to buy any specials ""parts"" to get the job done, unlike Spencer. 
Also, they got the belts on in the time it took Spencer to set up his laptop. 

tl:dr Don't use this company. Sketchy business practices. Lack of car knowledge.  Look them up on google and find all the bad stuff that pops up about them."
2,1,"I would not suggest this company.  I scheduled an afternoon appointment for 3pm thru their office.  At 3:15 I called their office to ask where was 
their tech?? They told me that he would be there in 15 minutes.  At 3:45, there is no tech and no phone call from their office.   I called them 
again and cancelled the appointment.  In my opinion, they have poor customer service skills.  Also I was told they wanted payment in cash, if a 
credit card is used they will charge an extra 7% service fee."
2,5,"Funny story, around last year I was VERY hesitant about calling this place because of the reviews but I was stranded at home with no way to work the next day! I called and spoke to Mark and he was here within the time frame he promised. He fixed my belt and that was that. My cars alternator went out last week and again I was stranded at home. I recalled using this company last year and decided to give them a call again. To my surprise, Mark shows up again and does his magic! His pricing was very reasonable and arrived early this morning! He even worked as fast as he could because he thought I had to go to work. He's very honest and provided the upmost best customer service! That's very rare now a days especially for a woman with car problems. I'd recommend Mark for sure as he saved me not once but TWICE already! Thanks Mark!"
2,5,"Mark was SO helpful!! The prices are very very good and their flexibility is crazy good too! Mark was able to come to our office, fix our truck and he was so friendly and helpful the whole time! We will definitely be using Mark is the future. 10/10 would recommend! (:"
3.5,5,"I highly recommended place. First visit, gotten my headlight bulbs replaced 3 years ago and not only were they $240 cheaper than I was quoted by my BMW dealership, but they repaired all my issues very quickly. 2 years ago they fixed my brake and signal lights. Last year gave me great price on fixing my automatic window motor. Last month, I took my car in for some issues & tune up. They fixed my one cylinders, tired rotation, & did tune up same day. Paul, owners Eric & Sheila are SO AWESOME! I refer my friends to this place. They do honest work, price right/competitive pricing & have great customer service! Love taking my BMW here for repairs."
3.5,5,They have good prices there not pushy they even gave me a ride to where I needed to go while the car was getting fixed ....good honest place
3.5,2,"I have to echo Laura M.'s post below. Same experience: took far longer than promised (2 weeks instead of stated 2 days). I furnished Don's D.I. with a service list, but two *very important* repairs were overlooked. Like Laura, they only started working on my vehicle after I called them on the 11th day. I could have used my car those 11 days. Finally the 'work' commenced, but only after a few prompts from me via phone inquiries. When I returned home I noticed a FILTHY tire pressure gauge/tank in my back cargo area. This was distressing as I keep my SUV spotless. I asked why the tank was in my cargo area and was told my tire kept going low and they needed to keep adding air. I asked did you repair the tire? ""No, we don't do that kind of work here."" I then asked ""why didn't you tell me about the tire issue when I picked up the car? Paul then tells me that they sealed the tire! At this point alarm bells went off and I struck them from my address book. I no longer have any confidence in Don's D.I. 'service.' There are other repair facilities in Vegas with much higher ratings which I now need since Don's did not finish the work as promised. Thanks, Yelp!"
3.5,4,"In town for a few weeks for work and had to take my boyfriend's truck in for an oil change... then my car needed new spark plugs - found these guys on yelp, and they were great! Very quick and reasonable. I liked that most of the customers were regulars - like the place I go to at home. Def thumbs up!"
3.5,5,"BMW dealer shop conned me in the past. I had to find a honest repair shop.Thanks to yelp,I found one.They are very busy and that's good sign.I'll be back again."
3.5,1,"I have nothing good to say about this shop.  My son's car was overheating and we had it towed here.  They said it was a broken hose and repaired it.  2 days later it overheated again.  Towed it back to the shop, he has no ideal why it is overheating and just wanted to replace the water pump.  Aren't mechanics suppose to diagnose the problem, not guess at it.  Red Flag - took it to another shop where it is being repaired for what is really wrong and no it was not the water pump.  So this shop cost me $$$ to have it towed twice when it should have been diagnosed correctly the first time."
3.5,5,"Very nice and helpful! I went in for a problem with my wheel. They looked at the car and didn't even charge me for labor! 

-a nonessential part rusted off and didn't need to be replaced"
3.5,5,"Nice work, Don's. Our water pump went out  on our Suburban just before we were leaving to cross the desert in August. ""Boo"" that it went out, but ""yay"" that it happened before we left, instead of in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. 

Anyway, we called Don's, explained our situation, and Luis, their long-time service manager, said ""bring it in, man"" (he says that kind of thing).  It was done in 3 hours, THAT SAME DAY, no appointment, and for a very reasonable cost. 

I've used Don's for about 5 years, and while they are not omnipotent, they do good, honest wrench work at a fair price. Plus, if you've got your tit in a wringer on scheduling, explain your situation, and chances are they can help you out."
3.5,1,"0 stars for us. We have a 1995 suburban 4×4 . We had our transmission fully rebuilt by these people. When I called Louie the manager told me $1900 OTD and we would have our truck back within a few days. Well 3 weeks passed and we called to check the status of our truck they told us a few more days. 5 weeks into having our truck we were a little irritated at the lack of response on the time it was taking . We heard a hundred different stories.  Louie took a vacation during this time and one of his associates told us he takes too many vacations. The right hand never knew what the left was doing. Meanwhile it took us almost 7 weeks to get our only vehicle back. No one cared or took responsibility for what had happened.  When we were picking up our truck. We went down there after they told us it would be ready tomorrow.  When we got there they told us it was at their other shop getting worked on. We had to drive through town to get there .. Needless to say worst service ever! They would not refund any of our money we had paid them PRIOR to the truck sitting there 7 weeks. Now here's the ringer. I came to my normal mechanic and he showed us how they busted our tranny pan gasket and bent the pan probably by over torquing the bolts , and our transmission dipstick was shoved in backwards and bent, they didn't even change our rear main seal!!! I will never recommend them and I hope they know they've made this a horrible experience.  Shame on you!"
3.5,5,"These guys are amazing.  Same repairs that the dealer wanted $1500 for, they did for $350.  Hubby had a repair on his vehicle done for $200 that others wanted $750 for.  Each time, the repairs were done when they said they would be done.  Nice people, too!  Are they inconveniently located for me?  Sure.. but well worth the trip."
3.5,1,"Worst experience EVER!! people if you are looking for dishonest mechanics this is the place too go. I had an '98 Honda Accord and I had a catalyst converter replaced and I had went to another mechanic place to get my oil changed and they told me that my catalyst converter was installed backwards! Went and got ahold of Louie and he said ""well there's nothing we can do about it"" so.. I went ahead and called consumer affairs and received my money back. NEVER recommending my family and friends here."
3.5,3,"Went there because a co-worker referred me, I needed my engine replaced, they had my car twice as long as they estimated, when I got the car back my power steering pump was out so the car went right back into the shop, they would've gotten 4 stars because the price was awesome but now my oil light keeps coming back on and I still have an oil leak."
3.5,5,"I have gone here for several years now, they are always friendly, and have very fair prices.  I've found that the best mechanics have tons of cars outside of their place and Don's certainly fits that description. A+ in my book."
3.5,5,"My check engine light came one while visiting Vegas and being far from home I didn't want to just ignore it.  I came her after reviewing mechanics near our hotel online. Don Di's got the best local review by far so I chose them. 

I got to the shop right when they opened. Its not fancy by any means, but who care as long as the prices are fair and they are honest. They hooked up there computer and let me know my problem. I was then ready to beat them off with a stick since almost EVERY mechanic tries to scare women and rip them off. That wasn't the case here. 

He let me know what the code was and that I could make it back home with no problem. He also showed me a similar part that failed and let me know it would take me sometime to get to that point. He didn't try to take my money at all. Very appreciative of that :)  If your a local, I recommend this shop. Very honest shop!"
3.5,1,"CAUTION!  Please let me save you your time and possibly money!

It starts with my truck failing its smog check because of a P0507 which is ""excessively high RPM"" ... so after speaking w/ a family mechanic, we found a vacuum leak and changed the hose.  Long story short, that didn't fix the problem; therefore we changed the IAC Valve with no success, so Dons Auto here we come on a referral.

Talked w/ Paul the manager, pretty charming guy and he states they need to perform a smoke check to locate if there's any other vacuum leaks.  Okay after they inspected the truck, I received a call and Paul stated I need a IAC valve and the one I have is defective.  ""Scratch my head"" but okay, if that's it go ahead.

I then go to pick my truck up at the end of day and the mechanic calls Paul to the back and then Paul calls me to the back & states look(he sprays starting fluid around the Intake manifold and shows me on their diagnostics computer the numbers jumping.  Okay, not sure what that means but then he states you have a cracked Intake Manifold as well then walks me up front and quoted me 650.00 plus the cost of the IAC Valve at another 250 w/ labor, Wow!

After sleeping on it, something just didn't seem right, why wasn't the intake manifold leak found from the beginning after the initial smoke test ... long story short, there was no smoke test, all guess work @ the cost of 98.00 out of my pocket.

End of story is I took my truck to another Mechanic(Dave's Auto) on Pecos and they found a vacuum leak behind the intake manifold, replaced the hose/line reset the check engine light at the cost of 150.00 problem solved.  No new intake manifold needed nor a defective IAC Valve.

STAY AWAY FROM DON'S DI AUTOMOTIVE!"
3.5,1,"I went to Las Vegas from home in San Diego and the car overheated. I checked up on various  auto  shops and read the 'stellar' reviews about this place. I dropped my car in on a Wednesday and was told it would be ready by Monday. I called in every other day just to check up. By Sunday though, I was told it would take several more days to get done. If I wasn't in such a rush to get back home, this wouldn't be a problem but it was. I also have to say, when I called on Sunday the guy over the phone laughed at my situation. Finally, by the time I got my car back the air conditioning buttons weren't working like they used to. 

It is in your best interest for the sake of your car DO NOT come here."
3.5,5,Excellent. Fixed my AC by converting it and refilling with R134. Helped me survive the scorching Las Vegas heat.
3.5,5,"My car has needed a tune up for the last 5,000 miles and finally, fearing I'd end up one of those poor stranded motorists on the side of the road, I began researching where to take it in.  Because of their good reviews on Yelp I chose Don Di auto, got up at the crack of dawn, and had my car in by 8am.  They quoted me a good price for a minor tune up and an oil change (under $200), and I waited no longer than 2 hours. 

While in the waiting area I met a really nice lady who said she had been bringing her cars into Don Di for the last 10 years and that they had always been upfront and honest with her.  She found them after another shady repair shop had quoted her hundreds of dollars for a repair that was totally unnecessary, and that in the last 10 years Don Di has been her go-to auto repair place for minor and major needs. 

Another reviewer hit it o the head when they said don't let the appearance of the place fool you.  It looks totally run down but they do stellar work so save yourself a head ache and go here if your car is no longer under manufacturer's warrantee and you have to pay out of pocket for repairs."
3.5,5,"drove from California to vegas to find a repair shop to fix my nephews truck while searching on YELP  i came across( Don DI)  don't let the looks of the place scare you !
Luis the manager s AWESOME ! from the moment we spoke i felt completely comfortable  and trusting , they even went beyond my repair and helped me out just because they were working in the general area ...to all the people from CA who find themselves in need of auto repair when visiting vegas , GO  and see the Fella's from DON's DI SERVICES  .... trust the sign fair price !!! and that is the TRUTH! thanks guys"
3.5,5,"My husband and I took are dodge truck, took Dons Di Auto weve taken it their before,we have also recommended our friends their, the services is exceptional,and the work they do, very honest.We tried taking to Sun Auto for the  same stuff because we didn't want iur car to over heat big mistake they wanted to charge us double the price.The Manger their Paul Synder has excellent customer service, you pay for good work ,and good customer service. Oh almost forgot he does have on his sight a discount coupon, that my son told us about."
3.5,5,"I read all the positive reviews on line and decided to give them a try. My cars starting having problems while driving to Las Vegas from San Diego. I took it to DI Auto explained to them I was only in town for two days and if they could expedite this. They gave me a ride to and from my hotel and had completed all the work by noon-ish. Turns out a coil in the eng had failed and it needed a tune up (I was meaning to get a turn up for months, 80k+ miles and never had a major one done). Out the door for less than $300. I'm thinking there are other shops out there who would take advantage of out of town emergency cases. Not these guys."
3.5,5,"After getting an outrageous quote for a 60,000 mile checkup at a shop by my house, i turned to Google.  There were great reviews for this place and even a coupon!  I got a quote over the phone which saved me 200.00!  I left my car there, they did the work in a reasonable amount of time, and didnt try to sell me anything I didnt need! Very honest and friendly shop and so happy i found them!"
3.5,1,"This place has some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  I took my car in for a check engine light that was on.  The next day they told me that it was a $300 fix and I should have my car in a day or two. 19 days and $825 I finally have my car back. We were never called to tell us about the delays, we would have to call the shop and would get the run around every time. After they did a bunch of work on the car they decided it would be an extra $500 to fix it.  At that point our car should have been ready in a couple of days. I finally had to stop in the shop only to find out it hadn't even been worked on. The shop foreman looked me in the eye and told me my car would be done that day, then it wasn't, and he didn't even bother to call and let us know what was going on.   We got an appology on the phone and were told that we would be ""helped"" with the bill.  Apparently ""help"" means $15 off.  And ""if only we had brought cash"" they could of helped us more.  Even the employees at the shop admit that things are run poorly and that I'm not the only customer that this has happened too.  I will never go there again."
3.5,5,"Fast, efficient and reasonable.  They don't try to sell you shit or treat you stupid for being a chick."
3.5,1,The absolute worst place i have ever taken my truck to be worked on.  They lie to ypu about what's wrong with it.  Jack up the price when its not under warranty and are absolute scoundrels
3.5,4,Had to bring in my car when I needed some new brakes. They were nice and able to do the job in a reasonable time. Nice to finally have auto guys that are not complete idiots. They are my main guys I will be using for now on. Recommended.
3.5,1,"Dishonest and worst repair !   Replace an upper oil pan , costs me 650$ ! They rare cheating ! The oil pan costs only 32$ . They did not repair my car well, finally I had to towed it away from Las Vegas to low angles!  Cheating repair !"
3.5,5,"They're trustworthy, cheap, competent, thorough, communicative, nice, and will shuttle you to a nearby location while your car is being worked on. I couldn't ask for anything more."
3.5,1,"This place is atrocious. PLEASE do not waste your time or money here. 
I brought my F-250 in because of an odd noise that I suspected was the turbos. Here is a timeline. Please keep in mind that I had to call them repeatedly for updates. Paul (the GM) would say, ""I will call you by 3:00."" I would wait until 3:30 and then I would have to be the one to call. This happened constantly. 

5/1- Paul confirms that it is an issue with the turbos. We begin contacting our warranty company.
5/4- Warranty company approves and sends new turbos to the shop. Paul tells me to come down and pay. He says one I pay they will start working on the truck so it is ready when the new part arrives. 
5/8- I call Paul and ask if the turbo arrived. He has to check and then realizes they came in the day before. I ask when I can expect the truck to be done. He then informs me that they never started on it and won't be able to until Thursday. 
5/10- They tell me they started on the truck at about 4:30pm. 
5/11- I'm told in the morning that it MAY be done by the end of day. It is not.
5/12- Jack tells me that they need to order some bolts but they will arrive Monday and then they will be able to finish it that day. 
5/14- The bolts arrive but they say they can't finish today. 
5/15- I show up at the shop. Paul informs me that they had to deal with a lot of rust and other issues but the truck SHOULD be done tomorrow. 
5/16- They ""finish"" but discover an issue with the EPB.
5/17- They replace the EPB but discover an issue with the DPF. I ask if it is driveable and he says yes so I tell Paul I will pick it up in the morning. 
5/18- I pick up the truck and drive it straight to another mechanic to have the DPF looked at. He immediately realizes that the turbo is broken. He also notices missing gaskets, a missing fuel line brace and that there half broken bolts left attached to the cab. 
5/23- I confront Paul about this and include pictures provided to me by the new mechanic. He says he has no idea how this happened and would need to talk to his techs. He refuses to refund my money and tells me to e-mail his ""boss."" He claims to not have a phone number for his boss. The e-mail address is the same as the e-mail on their website for contacting the shop and Paul. I received a lengthy e-mail back from ""Eric"" agreeing with Paul. In my original e-mail I requested that he call me. After his first response I asked again for him to call me. He responded claiming he is unable to call and can only discuss these issues via e-mail. 

This shop is either completely incompetent or they are a bunch of scammers. Either way, DO NOT bring your vehicle there. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB and the Bureau of Consumer Protection and I encourage anyone who has had similar experiences here to do the same."
3.5,4,"I have used Don's DI for years, for major issues: Air conditioning compressor, and a number of other at least quasi-high ticket repairs. It's extraordinary: There are cars all over the place and they're working all the time, so be ready to leave your vehicle there overnight for any big repair. 

That said, in my view, they're the best mechanics in town with long-term experience and they stand behind their work. Have I had to bring my car back on a repair they did? Yes, at least once, maybe twice. But who hasn't?

Aside from getting the job done, pricing is the most important thing: Again, as an example, the air conditioning issue was literally less than half of anywhere I checked in town, and other repairs were equally low in price. (Nat B., while I don't mind disagreeing with people on restaurants, mechanics are different and I really do trust these guys. It was, by the August 2010 that I had the air issue in my car).

At the end of the day, why would I drive from Summerlin to Don's (I abhor driving anywhere), have to have someone follow me and take me back, if they weren't this good. I don't even like driving to restaurants I like -- I let my wife do it...It's the New Yorker in me."
3.5,1,Don't go there I Took my car there for just fuses that's all my 2003 sl500 Mercedes Benz couple weeks went by I always kept in touch with them thy never put any fuses in my car or Even touched it he told me my son my ex-boyfriend thy even told the police That they never touched it or put any fuses in it the car I called Carson City because they would not let me have my car even though I was trying to work with them Carson City told me they put the title in their name and stole my car literally stole my car took my baby away from me that I had for 14 years I am left with no car do not go there these people are thieves they steal cars they told the Better Business Bureau that they did major repairs that is a lie and the owner came out with a gun to my face and my ex-boyfriend's face they are liars and thieves there's a God and karma is huge please there has to be someone out here who can help me Sue these people or close them down because this is not right they never sent me Any mail to inform me no registered mail nothing thy did this all within less then 40 days I came there several times to give them money in the price kept going higher up to $3000 now even with storage fees it wasn't that high they just wanted the car that's all I want to pay for lie detector test to be done on them and myself and we'll see who's the liar here because it surely is not me!!! Thieves and liars there is a God and he's going to get you guys!!!!
3.5,5,"I have a Dodge Durango R/T. I had looked around for a shop that I can bring my truck to and also trust them. I drover to Don's Di and explained my issue. They kept my truck for 1 day, and called me and briefly explained the issue and how much everything would cost, the price is great and the service is amazing! I would highly recommend this shop to anybody."
3.5,4,"DILIGENT AND FAIR

These guys worked their tukas off to get my cute old Subaru wagon on the road again so I could leave Vegas and save my bank account from emptying. 

Lovely people, straight forward and to the point. I appreciate what these guys were able to find out and fix. And in the end, I made it home safely - a jaunt of around 1000 miles.

Thank you guys!  Great work!"
3.5,5,"My car broke down in the middle of the road and they happened to be the closest auto mechanic with good reviews. I took a chance and had a towing company bring my car there. Paul the mechanic called me and explained that my radiator was completely busted. He gave me a reasonable price quote (my boyfriend helped me do the research) and it was fixed that same day. I'm very pleased with the customer service, which you don't get very often in car repair shops."
3.5,5,I have been back 2 or 3 times  and get great repair service at great pricing!  Its great to have a mechanic I trust!
3.5,1,"Brought my car in with a control panel issue.  Had the problem before and it was fixed quickly and affordable...not here. Brought it in and signed off on the replacement. I was told the car would be done by 6 that day.  Not only was it not done that day they didn't even look at it until 5pm the next day.  I understand getting backed up and that's fine, but they didn't even call and let me know I was to be without my car.  After 3 days the car was ""fixed""...started the car and the issue was not fixed. I had to wait 3 more hours while they worked on it some more.  Had to bring it back a week later and they wanted to charge for another $250 to fix what they didn't in the first place.  Wouldn't recommend it and will not go back."
3.5,5,Honest and very nice. They truly helped me out of a jam on my vacation thank you so much
3.5,5,"I love this place ! I moved to Vegas over a year ago , few months after moving here my differential went out in my magnum. I took it to another mechanic who allegedly "" fixed "" it. Well here it Is 8 months later and I notice my differential leaking , I take it to the place who fixed it , they quoted me $1100 to replace the seals. Sooooooo I started mechanic shopping came across DI auto. I called them and explained the problem with my car , brought it in for am estimate and got a quote $300 cheaper. I took my car in this morning , and picked It up at 5 ! They fixed all the problems and I paid what I was quoted. And got my car out same day ! Last place had my car 4 days ! I highly recommend this place !"
3.5,5,"Went to Vegas and my friends truck over heated when we got to Vegas.  We definitely needed a mechanic ASAP.  So Yelp came in handy and we found this shop.   Called and Paul was very helpful and gave us an estimate on the phone and told us to bring in her truck.   So the next morning we took it in and Treyvone, an employee,  was very nice and helpful.  He gave us a ride back to the hotel and we had to wait only a few hours for the truck to be ready.   Took a cab after the hours to the shop and we were pleased with the work done.   Pricing is decent.  Cmon they fixed it the same day and in a few hours. .

Very pleased with their service and will recommend to others if needed. ...

Treyvone keep up the humble and awesome personality. .. you were very nice. .."
3.5,5,"These guys are fast and awesome.  We have a campervan company here in San Francisco and these guys have helped us  out several times now with minor problems all the way up to  major issues.  I.E Searing heat destroying the Ac. Anyways thanks again for helping us.

3.5,1,"I can only give this repair shop a 1 rating  because they really suck I went there to get my head gasket replace and the only reason I went there is that they charged me $1900 to fix it which was a good deal from anyone else I priced in town and a good thing that they offered easy pay fiance.  But from anything else the mechanics are awful very lazy and nasty. The gentleman that sits at the desk Paul and answer the phone Mr. Receptionist is great bullshiter he will tell you wonderful things on the phone until you get there and you get your car you will be in for a shocker. It took my car 1 month to get it repaired . After I got back I notice panels were missing that they apparently throw out in the garbage and then they  lied and said we are ordering new ones for you.  So when they called my in and said we have your panels come down get them on . I  go down there and you won't believe what they did the took bunch of cardboard painted in black stapled them right in there.  These cover panels that sit behind the tire looks like shit now. I asked the mechanic what the hell is this and they said sorry mitisbushi doesn't make them anymore.  That's the best we can do . People let me tell you it doesn't end there today Monday 10/09/2017 the temperatures were alittle cool so I decided to turn on the heater and guess what no heat just cold air. So I took it back Don's again first thing in the morning and said what did you guys do on to the heater when your mechanic replace my head gasket.  Then Paul said I don't know let's check it out probably  we did not switch it back to heat when it was fixed for the head gasket or we can flush it and this will solve the problem  . So they take my car to the back for 1 hour and tried to flush it with water then the mechanic comes back says to me sorry I have bad news your Heater core is clogged.  At this point I flipped out and said what. You are kidding me.  It was working great before I brought it to you guys to fix the head gasket. Then Paul turns to me and said it's not our fault take it back to the Repair shop that replaced your Heater core in May  2017 .  As I drove on DI to go home . I could not believe it my car started to overheat smoke was coming out the dashboard and coolant started to leak back in side the car . There is"" No"" need for me to be going through this . These mechanics are not skilled to do any mechanic work they don't know a damn thing  about cars.  Now I had to have my car towed and brought to the shop where I got my Heater core fixed back in May. Thanks to Paul and his unskilled mechanics I'm spending more to fix my car for their stupid mistakes . I have filed my report to the Better Business Bureau 

PLEASE BE AWARE OF DON'S DI A BUNCH OF CLOWNS AND THEY WILL LEAVE YOU WITH YOUR WALLET EMPTY  .DON'T GO THERE YOU WILL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE"
3.5,5,"Trust no other place in town to fix European cars but Don's!!  Fixed my Audi Q7 air blower controller for less then half of what Audi wanted to charge, and Audi charges $160 diagnostic fee, Don's does not. Found them on referral from my boss who takes her Maseriti there for years... Thank you Eric"
3.5,2,"Decided to check this shop out not only for its higher than average rating on here and also scoop up the $125 for $100 voucher here on Yelp. First impression is this a no frills type spot and mechanics in the garage were working on high end luxury cars was somewhat of an indicator of a decent shop.

Came in to change break pads and rotors and repair a portion of my passenger side control arm. Turned out there was a problem with one of my rotors and needed to be worked on in order to properly slap it back on there. Not a good sign, it took the entire day. At least they provided free shuttle service. However the mechanic working on my vehicle seemed more preoccupied that it was his Birthday THAT DAY and I noticed how he was out that door with the quickness. 

Fast forward a few weeks later I take it to my Acura dealership for an alignment since Don Di's sends their cars elsewhere for their alignments, they didn't have time to do it that day and dispite the price gauging that takes place at the dealer, I still don't really trust anyone else with my ride. 

One of the reps ask me if my breaks had been worked on recently because they had found missing pins and loose screws around my breaks. I couldn't believe it. They couldn't believe it. They hoisted up my baby and dragged me into the garage for me to see everything with my own eyes. It was kinda surreal, with the mechanics essentially scolding me without flat out saying, ""How dare you take this car to some second rate place and put yourself and other passengers in possible danger?"" Ah fu*k they were right.

No one else worked on my breaks since my visit @ Don Di's. Then I think back to the Don Di mechanic and how much he wanted to break out after working on my car all day on his Birthday on a hot Vegas day. But alas, there are no excuses when failing to do something so basic on something so important.

Sure, the chances of my breaks suddenly comin' apart and eating $#!+ on a concrete barrier as I'm smashing at somewhat erm.. non-grandma high speeds *ahem* proceeded by the thought of the parts of me and my whip strewn across the 15 because of something so simple was neglected maybe slim but damn come on guys. 

Here on out I'm not f*cking with these dudes and gonna second guess any service related coupon offered on here."
3.5,5,"We all know how horrible a feeling it is to have something go wrong with your car.  That gut wrenching kick in the balls you feel when it wont start, when it starts making strange noises, or when it starts overheating... You know it is bad and you know it will be expensive, and then on top of it you have to find a trustworthy place to take it where they wont rip you off. 

Next time this happens, go here!

Seriously, Don's DI is a cool locally owned place where they will treat you with respect, honesty, and let you leave with money left in your wallet.  For me? It is super out of the way, (i live way across town) but no matter what it takes, i will get my car to them because i know it will be fixed in a fair and speedy fashion. 

Thank you for making what could have been a horrible problem completely painless."
3.5,5,"This place is great, honest mechanics and affordable.  The place looks like a auto shop should lol..seriously saved me $700 and they did the job fast and great.  great place in town hands down."
3.5,1,"Went here to get my check engine light off.  I got a quote at 4 different mechanics for my issue & they all gave me about the same price, so I came here because it was close to my work.  What they said was the same price as everyone else was only half of the job that everyone else quoted me for.  I discovered this when my check engine light came back on & when I took it back they charged me $200 more for a part that they claimed they already fixed!?! Call several mechanics & friends who used to work for mechanics & they all agreed that I was ripped off.  Never going back."
3.5,2,"I really struggled with whether or not I wanted to post this. Everyone who works at the shop was very nice, but I think I was played when it comes to the cost of the repairs and the time it took to make the repairs. I decided to post this because I feel like other customers might benefit from hearing about my experience.

Don't DI Auto Repair told me my repairs would take a few hours, then four days...eventually I got my car back after 15 days. They never called me with status updates (even when they told me they would), I had to call them. I even sat in their shop the day they said it'd be ready (for five hours) and was appalled to hear them on the phone ordering parts for my car that they knew I needed more than a week prior. They gave me back my car with trash and spare parts in the front seat, and a dead battery. And despite replacing the radiator, not even a month later, the radiator hose needed to be replaced.

Here is what happened to my car:

I had a 2000 Chevy Blazer. One evening I was driving home and I heard something pop. I thought it was another car blowing a tire, but I got home and heard a sound like something was frying under the hood of my car. I had my car towed to their shop Monday morning (I used my insurance company's free towing service) because the next day I was flying to DC for a business trip and I figured it was a blown gasket and would take several days to repair. A few hours later I received a call from the shop, explaining that a hose had blown and something about a thermostat censor and the cost of parts and labor would be about $600 and my car would be ready that afternoon. I told them to go forward with the repairs.

A few hours later, I get another call and now I have a blown gasket and a rusted radiator and the repairs will take four days and the new cost is $1600. I protested the radiator because I just got a new radiator not even two years ago. I was accused of putting water in the radiator, causing it to rust, but I don't even know how to do that. I can't even refill  my washer fluid because I'm too short to reach that far under the hood. I was told I wasn't being charged anymore for labor, just the extra parts. I needed my car back, and I was in no position to buy a new one, and I know blown gaskets are usually $2500 minimum to repair, so I told them to proceed.

I eventually got my car back after 15 days (eight days after they originally said it'd be ready) and the bill was $1600 like originally promised so I paid. My passenger seat had a plastic bag on it that I guess was supposed to protect from stains from the mechanics, but there was still a palm-sized black grease smudge on the seat and a metal part sitting in my passenger seat. Who knows what that was from or if I still need it. There was also a bag with a Subway wrapper and an empty soda bottle, someone had lunch in my car.

I didn't notice until i got home (it was Christmas Eve and I wanted to get out of there) but I had some weird charges on my bill:
$225 work requested machine work - what is that?
oil filter and oil, although I was told I needed to bring it back for an oil change
$54.58 ""discount"" on what and for what, I have no idea
The day I sat in the lobby for five hours I was told I needed another $200 part, but it would be free because of the hassle. It's not listed on my bill at all, not even to indicate the discount.
Also, I bought a Yelp deal which theoretically should have lowered the cost, but it seems as though they just added an extra charge to balance it out.

The shop manager offered to give me a free oil change because I had to wait so long for my car. Which annoyed me because according to my bill I was already charged for an oil change.

Shortly after getting my car back it was struggling to start, the heater wasn't working, and when I slowed down or hit a bump, you can hear something rattling under my hood. I brought it back and was told the battery was dead. Also because I had posted pictures of my trashed front seat on Yelp, they offered to clean up my front seat and have my car detailed [they also called and messaged me about posting my pictures on Yelp, which is another reason why I hesitated to post this review]. Since they were charging me $100+ to replace a dead battery (that died because my car was sitting in their shop for more than 2 weeks) I just wanted to get away from there.

Almost a month later smoke was coming from under my hood and it was overheating. Had the car towed to their shop and was told the radiator hose was blown. That made me furious because they just replaced my radiator, wouldn't they have seen a faulty hose? I'm out another $100+.

Then I'm told I should just get a new car because the next time I bring it to them they'll probably have to replace the engine. 

I wish I had taken their advice when my car first blew its gasket, instead I feel like I threw away $2,000; money I could have invested in a new car, which I did eventually end up buyi"
3.5,1,"NEVER give this company a down payment.  They will not do the work and they will keep your money.

I was quoted $2400.00 for a rebuilt transmission and brake rebuild.  $1800.00 for the transmission and $600.00 for the brakes.  I was told I would have to put $1600.00 down.  They rebuilt the brakes but could not fix the transmission. They have kept my car for eight months.  I have to now scrap the car.  I understand that I will have to eat the $600.00 for brakes.  That leaves a balance of $1000.00 owed me.  They will not return my money.  My contact at Desert Auto, Paul will not help me.  He will not give me a number to call.  All he tells me is that this has to ""go through corporate"".  I did get an email address to which I sent a tersely worded message; that was two weeks ago and I have had no reply.  It seems my only recourse is going to be small claims court.  Another nightmare. Read less"
3.5,2,"They are cheap and if that is what you need then this will work for you. Just be prepared for what you pay for... Cheap work. 

The guys there are nice and they do seem very busy there. I took my car in for an ignition replacement and it took three days when they said same day... Don't mind the time it took I just don't like being told one thing and you do another.

After getting my vehicle and exiting into the street I noticed my blinkers and headlights would not work... It was dusk. So I had to bring it back and they fixed that in about an hour. They left metal shavings all over the floor and I had to clean grease off the strafing column. 

They sure are cheaper than many of the other shops in the area."
3.5,5,"We were 3.5 hours in our drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas when we started hearing noises.   My car started to be very sluggish and it wasn't responding to when I hit the gas. Perfect combination for panic when you're driving through the desert, right? We found Don's Auto Repair from a quick Yelp search and based on his great reviews called and got an appointment on the following day to see what was going wrong. We brought it to him right when they opened and explained what had happened. He said it would take an hour and right at the hour mark he called me saying to come get my car.  He was very honest and checked everything saying he couldn't find anything wrong with it, that it was probably just the extreme heat (it was 114 that day) and to take it easy driving back. He eased our minds that nothing serious was wrong and didn't charge us a thing."
3.5,4,"After my tedious and unsatisfied experience, the owner gave me a call and we scheduled to have my car fixed correctly. Eric is phenomenal, understanding, & handsome! and will do whatever he can to make things right. Thank you for fixing my car on time me making it convenient as can be! :) great customer servicing"
3.5,1,"DO NOT BRING YOUR BMW HERE!!! 
I brought my 2006 BMW 325I with 68k to this shop after overheating in Vegas. I had to leave it with them while I went back to California. They told me it was spark plugs, thermostat, and needed a coolant flush is what caused it to overheat. They charged me $900 and it ran fine for approx 3 days. It then started to overheat and show the same warnings. I called them and told them they had worked on it and it was doing the same thing. They replied ""better bring it some where to get it checked out"" I replied ""I did, I brought it to you"" his response was ""well I guess we were wrong"" DO NOT BRING YOUR BMW HERE, SOUNDS LIKE THEY WERE ON A TRIAL AND ERROR BASIS!!!!"
3.5,1,"It's to bad I can't give negative ratings. This is without a doubt the worse place to take anything to be repaired. They throw parts at a problem, and charge for things they don't do. You will be wasting your time and money here. 
I took an RV to them with two issues. A vibration in the engine and no dash air. They said it was motor mounts causing the vibration and a bad compressor, and wiring, and hoses, condenser, and needed Freon. 
After they did all this and the RV was ""ready"" I got there and the engine still had a vibration, and they said it needed more parts to fix the ac. This is after $3k to them. 
I paid them because they threatened to call the police ( which I should have let them do in hindsight ). 
Took the RV to a specialty dealer who found the engine vibration was a bad oxygen sensor, and there was no Freon in the system. Also Dons claimed to put in 3 lbs of Freon ( which I paid for ) and the system only holds 2 lbs. 
I could continue but hopefully everyone gets the point. DONT GO HERE"
3.5,1,My complaint was hard starting.Their diagnosis was a bad fuel pump.It was installed for about $400 but didn't fix it.Further diagnosis said it wasn't the fuel pump after all but the fuel pressure regulator.This was installed for a further $200 and this fixed it.So I'm out $400 because of either carelessness or inexperience in the initial diagnosis.This was not a particularly difficult problem and should have been done right the first time.
3.5,5,"These guys are great; Luis is the funniest!!  This last time I went on Saturday, they stayed overtime to help me with an oil change since I was heading out of town.  I felt so bad but Luis insisted I could be taken care of.  I've been here three times, twice for some type of check-up and this was the first oil change and each time was a great experience - the guys work hard.  I thank them all for the great work, being so fair and honest and the outstanding customer service!"
3.5,5,"I'm new to Las Vegas but am happy to say that I've already found a mechanic that I trust! Be advised, this place is really busy! (but more than likely that's just because word is out that they have really great prices!) It's definitely best to leave your car there and come back after repairs are finished. If you do have to stay, there's a small waiting area with a tv but it's just so busy here that I recommend leaving and coming back. The staff is really down to earth and that's a nice bonus. If you want reasonable prices in central Vegas, this is definitely the place to go."
3.5,5,"We had our alternator go out in our excursion while on vacation traveling from Utah to San Diego. I called Paul At Don's D.I and he said he could do the repairs while we waited and have us on the road by lunch time,they did the repairs which were cheaper than I expected and had me out the door by 11:30am and back on the road. On top of that I had tow trailer locked on with no way to remove it, so they worked in the sun at 107 degree temps to make sure they kept their word to have me on the road by noon. ABOVE AND BEYOND, thanks for saving our vacation."
3.5,5,"I had my classic Rolls Royce repaired here. It was great! They know exactly what they are talking about, they give great and thorough service! Very fair price and detail oriented. I WILL be back!"
3.5,1,"Absolutely the worst experience that i have ever had at a mechanic. I took my jeep in to have the blower motor replace and a new door latch installed on the passenger side door. long story short they had my car for a total of a month where they had totally forgotten about it twice until i reminded them, and charged me over 1000$ when I picked my car up the panel for the blower motor, the handle to the door, and the window knob, were all still disassembled with the screws missing, the blower motor shuts off after 5 min of operation. I would have taken it back to have them fix it, but I can not afford to have my car gone for that amount of time, and I believe that they are total cons who would probably break something else. I highly recommend that you stay as far away from this place as possible."
3.5,4,"We stopped here to have the car checked after inadvertently running over some debris on the freeway.  We didn't have to wait long, they were very polite and competent, and didn't even charge us even though the car turned out to be fine."
3.5,4,"At 80mph and 3500rpm going uphill just south of Mesquite, NV in the 105 degree summertime sun, I had a radiator hose pop off due to a faulty hose clamp.  Needless to say, I lost about 75% of my coolant in about 5 seconds.  After getting new coolant thanks to B&B Towing from Mesquite (via my USAA insurance - the BEST), and Jerry-rigging the clamp, I called Don's Di to make sure they'd be open when I got in to N Las Vegas.

I limped into Vegas and upon arrival, they jumped on the job and within about 30 minutes, a mechanic replaced the clamp at the whopping charge of $10.  They could have charged a lot more and I would've paid since they took me at last minute's notice and I had to be in Los Angeles that night.

Be advised: There isn't much parking available because of all the cars in the lot but the good thing is that's probably an indication they've got constant business which can be a sign of repeat customers and a good rep.

Also, be careful... the front desk manager is a bit of a joker and might tease a little bit but it's harmless.  It's probably to break up the boredom of sitting in an office all day - I know the feeling.

Thanks for the save guys!"
3.5,1,Don the Mechanic repair Shop is a joke the shop said they are Honest ! Toyota Matrix 03  fix throttle body and adjust idle took them ten minutes to get it fix total cost 300.00 Dollars .my car was not save to drive idle was high throttle body was never work on  this is wrost place to have your car fix on Boulder Hwy
3.5,5,"They are awesome.  I was on vacation and the air conditioning in my mini van stopped working.  It was close to 120 degrees at the time.  My wife, son and I were miserable.  A few weeks before our trip I had the air conditioning compressor replaced, the system flushed and pretty much rebuilt so my wife and I were pretty upset.

I called Don's and he assured me that he and his crew would get my van fixed.  The next day I got the call that it was minor.  The system was leaking and some seals were bad.  It was fixed before the end of the day.  I couldn't get to the shop before closing due to Vegas road construction and traffic.  He stayed an extra hour just so I could pick up my van.  When I got there he said no charge!  

I was in shock.  I still gave him a gift card to get pizza for every one.  They are very professional and wonderful people.  They really saved my vacation.  We will always remember what they did for us and will be back if we ever need a vehicle worked on in Vegas."
3.5,1,"I brought my vehicle in for repairs on a Tuesday. After 1 week of continuously running back & forth, as well as $1100 and ""further diagnosis"" needed according to Louie -- vehicle still was NOT repaired correctly, back tail light had been broken and suddenly the brake lines were cut on the car?! 

After receiving a second opionion from another garage, it was CLEAR that at least two of the repair Louie claimed were made to the car were not! Only one of the repairs was $425! I brought the car back and clearly pointed out there were NO new parts on the car - ONLY then did Louie refund my money, but only for this one repair! Clearly these guys are a bunch of crooks that overpromise, but under deliver! Steer Clear!"
3.5,2,"Please -- do not take your car here unless you will not be needing it for 3 to 5 days !! Their prices are low,  and they are swamped with business.  They will not have your car ready when promised !  It will be at least a day later.  Just a warning."
3.5,1,"I had been coming to this place for over 10 years, and they used to do fair and honest work but this is no longer the case. I took my car in for what I thought was either a fuel injector or fuel pump problem, turns out it was the fuel pump, they ended up charging me 390 dollars for the fuel pump unit alone (which only cost around 220) the labor was fair I guess even though I dropped my car off at 2:20 and they called me at 4:20 to say my car was fixed and still charged me for 3.5 hours of labor....  

When I came to pick up my car my gas gauge wasn't working, they told me I probably needed a new gauge, I hardly believe my gauge would go out at the exact same time my fuel pump did, I asked if it wasn't the sending unit on the new fuel pump and he said no because they tried 3 different fuel pumps, which I highly doubt.

I ended up taking my Tahoe to the Chevy dealer and they tested it and found out that it wasn't grounded right, this place is full of unskilled jokers now, while it was ok in the past I would not recommend anyone going to these fools anymore."
3.5,1,"I took my Audi there this past June 2018 to have the motor mounts replaced.  They charged me in excess of seven hundred dollars.  Yesterday 10/10/18), I took the same vehicle to another company, for a totally unrelated reason.  When the tech test drove my car, he felt movement (up and down) of the engine.  He stated the engine mounts were blown, and need to be replaced.  I was dumb struck. This means that Don's charged me, and did not even replace the mounts.  DO NOT GO TO THIS BUSINESS!  They charge for work that they not even do.  I have spoken with my attorney, and was advised to take them to Civil court, where I will most likely receive compensatory, and possibly punitive damages."
4.5,5,Everyone here are very friendly and honest! Brian Rice was over and above awesome. He knows his way around vehicles and has great customer service! He gives you the attention as if it were his vehicle that was being serviced. I will definitely return and refer Unlimited Collision and RV to my friends and family!
4.5,5,"Dropped My SUV after some bumper damage, and Tino took great care of me. I was in a rush when I dropped it off, and when i picked it up, and he made it all very seamless. They worked with my insurance and I didn't have to do a thing. There was a delay in getting my car fixed, but totally on the side of insurance. Great work, and if you can, work with Tino!"
4.5,5,"I took my Ford Fusion in for a fender repair, dealt with the owner himself.  Great guy right off the bat.  They repaired the fender and painted it perfectly, no way of noticing there was damage there before.  The price was fantastic as well!  I highly recommend Unlimited Collision for your vehicle repair needs."
4.5,5,"Unfortunately for us, my husband and I have become good customers here due to several ""mishaps"" with our cars.  Without going into detail regarding the damages, let me just say that Unlimited Collision has done a beautiful, no let me say perfect, job making our cars look newer than new.  Thanks, Brian (who was wonderful) and everyone who worked on our vehicles.  And while you're great guys, we hope not to see you soon.

4.5,5,"I recently got my vehicle repaired at Unlimited Collision the body work and paint job looked like my car was never in a accident,  it actually looked better that the day i took it off the lot!! This place is very professional and experienced in what they do."
4.5,5,"Matt, Dave and their staff are professional honest people. They fixed my daughters BMW at a reasonable price. Paint matches perfectly and no evidence of previous damage. Also, so impressed that the owner called me during off business hours. I was always kept in the loop. Overall A++"
4.5,5,"I have a custom van conversion that was damaged by some idiot at the ball park. it has a custom fade all the way around the vehicle. since my insurance only paid for two doors to be painted I was really worried about the match. Unlimited did a fantastic job and matched my paint perfectly. I cant believe it, two colors both faded in to each other and you cant tell the two doors where ever touched. thanks Unlimited! Highly recommend."
4.5,5,"We took our car in on Monday to get some front end damage repaired. They provided a very reasonable, accurate quote and said our car would be done on Wednesday afternoon. We called Wednesday morning and they told us the paint wasn't completely dry, but would be ready on Thursday afternoon. When my husband picked up the car, it was PERFECT! The paint matched, you couldn't see where the repair was done...it was beautiful! My husband was impressed with the professionalism of the people and the shop, and their attention to detail and customer service was the best we've seen in a long time. We highly recommend Unlimited Collision and RV."
4.5,5,I had an amazing experience with Unlimited Collision. Someone hit my car and their insurance company sent me here for repairs. They made the entire thing quick and painless. David was awesome. Not only was he extremely nice and professional but he also kept me in the loop. I would definitely recommend Unlimited Collision and I will give them my business whenever I have car repairs in the future!
4.5,5,"The coach battery in our motor home was not charging while plugged into power. As we were on the road, one of the supervisors, Sonny, was able to work us in quickly. The technician, Joe, who has a great deal of experience, identified the problem as a faulty converter, ordered the part and installed it the next day. I highly recommend this shop."
4.5,5,This is a wonderful place to work with they took care of all of my insurance issues and repaired my RV to as good as new condition. They also are a full service Collision Repair which takes care of all of my needs from bumper to bumper on the. Coach. I highly recommend unlimited collision and RV repair.
4.5,5,Everybody here takes care of you..I mean everybody!..took my car in to remove some superglue on the paint...didn't realize the glue was on my tail light to..they took the extra step and clean this off too..highly approve this body shop
4.5,5,"This is a revised review.  I have used this company 3 times now.  The first two times I was thrilled with the experience.  The third time I was less than satisfied
I am glad to say that the company honored their commitment and made things right and I am a happy client once again."
4.5,1,"This is a revised review.  I have used this company 3 times now.  The first two times I was thrilled with the experience.  This company painted two commercial box trucks for my company.  I just had them paint a vehicle 1/4 the size, the original quote was twice the money as the box vans.  We called and the price was negotiated down from 4500 to 3600 which we agreed to with the understanding that it was sooooo much more because they had to take things apart to paint the doorjams etc.  we got the car back with no painted door jams and the owner has refused to make the job right.  3600.00 to paint just the exterior of a 2012 Scion is a joke.  To not honor the commitment made is more than a joke, it is wrong.  Needless to say the van I just bought that was on the way to be painted by this company is being routed to a competitor.  I am disappointed. As a service company myself I can't imagine not honoring my work."
4.5,5,"my partner and i showed  up  Oct 2016 in a 10yr old Mandalay that was in need of work on a slide out.  Not knowing anything about this company other than the reviews.  We showed up to try them out  Everyone here is very nice and professional.  We explain that our bedroom slide leans in as you open it. Both nightstands would drag along the floor.  We first showed the problem to Camping World only to make it worse.
   Unlimited Collision not only fixed the problem they even repaired the scuff marks on the floor from the nightstands free of charge.

PRO:  This company is no joke.  There prices are real good and they know everything about RV repair.  
CON:  Because they get extremely busy at times don't always expect them to get the job done on time.  BE PATIENT.
  If you are a patient customer they will go out of there way to make it right."
4.5,5,"My window regulator broke a few weeks ago  - I started the project of fixing it myself, but I couldn't get two of the screws off & ended up stalled on it. Fast forward to today -- it's raining again & I'm sick of having the window be an issue so I stopped in to see how much it'd be to fix it or if at the least they could throw in some screws or something to hold the window up until I can afford to get it fully fixed. Long story short - they propped up the window for me & the owner wouldn't even let me pay him for it saying, ""You & your daughters don't need to be cold, getting wet & sick."" I was surprised & touched, but more so just extremely grateful because I'm on a tight budget & I wasn't expecting that expense so it would have really set me back this week financially. Needless to say, this will be my go to location for my auto body repair needs. He didn't have to be so kind, but he was & that kindness has earned my future business!"
4.5,1,"For any who have used the services of this company in the last couple months, I apologize for taking so long to provide this review. Hopefully your experience was better than mine.

I contacted Matt Gorges, owner of Unlimited Collision and RV in Peoria, Arizona to do an estimate of repair work on my coach.

I arrived at the facility on 17 June. There is a nice, big sign in the window, ""Free Estimates"". 
Nice.

Matt wasn't in but the guy at the desk walked out and inspected the coach. I was talking with him about the estimate when Matt came in.

Matt asked if I would be leaving the coach. As I'm living in it, I can't do that and told him I just needed the estimate.

Raising his voice, he said they don't provide estimates. Color me confused.

I said, ok, can you just give me a ball park idea? I can't tell if the insurance company got it right and I'm not sure I can afford the deductible.

Raising his voice another level, Matt said, sure, I think it will be $4500.

I said, ok, can you put that in writing?

Raising his voice a third notch, Matt told his guy to get a sticky note and write $4500 on it.

Gotta say, this finally got to me.

Raising my voice, I told Matt he should calm down, I'm just trying to understand how things work. He went on about being in the business 50 years, never heard of anyone giving an estimate, etc., etc. Seriously.

And, he told me to leave his premises. I told him I wanted the service he advertized. He said he would call the police.

One of the advantages of being a really old guy and being retired is I really have no daily plan. Well, that day, my plan was for an estimate.

So, told him to get after it, let's get the police in here. It took about an hour for the policeman to arrive. Another hour of him talking to each of the players.

In the end, Matt wrote the estimate properly and I left with it. Mission accomplished at the price of more aggravation and annoyance than were warranted.

The only guy with a clue about customer service was the first guy I met, whose name I did not. Matt, the owner and sales guy? Not. Matt's brother, the muscle who will tower over you in an attempt at intimidation? Not.

I have no idea how competent they are in doing the work. I will say that there were too many coaches and cars in various states of repair for the size of the site. Indicates poor management and leadership which generally translates to poor performance."
4.5,1,Been trying to call Corey back left several messages. They fixed a dent in my truck but then burned through the paint on my quarter panel. Brand new f250 Black. My dent is fixed but now I have a bigger mark on the panel next to it. Maybe they might call me back after posting this review.
4.5,5,"It's true...everyone here takes care of you! Ever since my first call you could just feel the empathy and professionalism through the phone. David and the guys took great care of my car, worked with the insurance company, kept me in loop, and got the work done quickly. I'm so glad I choose Unlimited Collision & RV, it's nice to know there's still trustworthy shops out there, that won't take advantage of a single lady and her pocktet's! My Malibu looks even better than before my accident, you cant even tell there was ever damage to the frame or rear. I'll defiantly refer fam and friends.  Special thanks to David:) You Truly Rock!!!"
4,5,We have had very good service from Affordable RV. Their work has always been satisfactory. Prices are in line with all other RV dealers in the Las Vegas area. We have a 41 ft motor home and Affordable took care of it when it was under the warranty and now after the warranty has expired.  One dealer in town told us they had done some work and Affordable RV showed us it was still a factory filter. We are very happy with this company. Only negative is there is a waiting list now to get in for work to be done
4,5,This is my favor place to call when I need something for my RV they have the best customer service they are really nice people and their prices are affordable
4,5,We had a problem with our landing gear on our fifth wheel while in the infield campground at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. We found the gear box had broke. My husband pulled off the gear box and motor and we took it over to Affordable. They tested the motor and told us it was still good and all we really needed was the gear box which thankfully they had in stock and at a great price. They removed the broken one and put the new one on the motor. Hubby installed it and everything is working as it should. Thanks for being so honest and getting us back on the road.
4,1,"Simply - don't bother. They left me high and dry, and I strongly encourage you to call another shop.

I was recommended Affordable RV service by the folks at Oasis RV resort when one of my leveling jacks became stuck down and I was unable to retract it on my own. Obviously, when one jack down, I couldn't go anywhere, and I was scheduled to leave the next day.

I spoke to Mike (from Affordable) on a Friday evening, and set an appointment for 9:30am on Saturday for him to come out and get me back on the road. The folks at Oasis were great in helping get this set up for me. Mike gave me his personal cell phone, which was great (I thought). 

Saturday morning came, and at 9:45 still no Mike, so I called his phone and left a voicemail. No call back. Tried again after 10:00. Then got worried, as I needed to check out, and get myself back on the road. At 10:15 called again, he picked up, then hung up. Tried back, since I knew he was most likely holding the phone and straight to voicemail. Tried  once more later, and no luck. I also called their business line, and just got voicemail.

Realizing that Affordable RV was not going to show up, Oasis RV Resort was kind enough to give me a later checkout time, while I attempted to find someone else to get me retracted and back on the road. A few hours later, Discount RV came to the rescue. Quick, courteous, and helpful. I strongly recommend them.

Mike and Affordable RV? It's now Tuesday, and I still haven't heard  from them. Not even a call back. If you have a time  sensitive repair issue, DO NOT CALL THESE GUYS. Really, really, poor performance."
4,2,"So we bought an RV and wanted everything checked out to make sure it was all road worthy. We already knew the front leveling jacks weren't working, and let them know. Called for an appt, and even with the appt, they said they wouldn't be able to look at it for at least a few days.  Wonder what's up with having an appt then? I'd think having a 35ft RV sitting in their lot for a few days would be inconvenient for them.

They call us back earlier than scheduled. Wow, great! They said there was nothing wrong, and nothing needed replacing. $249. Ok, and what about the leveling jacks? What was the problem? Oops, they forgot to look at them. So we basically drove up to Northtown from Summerlin for no reason. They told us it'd be at least another few days. Ok, but hubby is gonna be out of town, and possibly no cell service, so we gave them my number and told them specifically to call me when it was ready. Guess what? Yup, they called hubby. So he had to call me to tell me it was ready.

So I go up there to pick it up. Now it's $560, and the jacks just needed a cellinoid. When I'm ready to pay, I hand them my debit card. They tell me, Oh credit card? Extra 4%. Nope, it's a debit card. Oh, debit card extra 2%.  BULLSHIT. I've owned 2 businesses before and I know debit cards don't have a percentage tacked on for using the terminal bc it comes directly out of the customer's checking acct that day. And even if it did, it's part of the cost of running a business. I would just eat the cost of taking credit cards! So I went to go get cash instead; closest one was a 7-11...in a sketchy part of town. Nice. 

Frankly I'm surprised that they didn't charge me a per day storage fee for not picking up the RV the same day. They've got huge signs all over saying that, but nothing about card fees.

They did fix what needed to be fixed, but in no way did we feel like valued customers. Didn't even get smiles from any of the staff even once. Hopefully nothing else needs repairing, but if it does, we are def not coming back here."
4,5,"they were very professional, scheduled a drop off and maintained estimated work time to fix an issue on our generator completed the job and even took care of a couple issues I wasnt aware of, extremely satisfied with there service and would highly recommend them for all of your RV needs! thank you again"
4,5,"My dometic rv fridge just wasn't cooling enough on propane. They diagnosed a faulty gas valve in 30 mins and ordered a replacement one shipping to my next location as I needed to travel. Allie even followed up with Dometic to include the burner jet with the valve for no extra charge as we realized afterwards we needed that part too. The parts arrived in 2 days as promised. I installed them myself and now my fridge cools great! Thanks Allie, Dave and Mike for taking care of me. :)"
4,5,"What can i say.... i was not even a customer, i was fighting with my Generator at a truck stop, and those two guys came toward me and said "" you seem to have problems with your generator, we are fixing them all the time, let us help you""
Five minutes after my problem was fixed. 
They absolutely refuse any money. "" just come to out shop when you need work to be done on your RV""
For sure i will drive from LA to vegas to have them working on my RV, which will be pretty soon for a major overall, my rv after 10 years has logged over 175,000 miles. 
Thank you so much guys."
4,1,"About 18 months ago I took in my toy hauler to Affordable RV because I noticed the front right corner sagging. Come to find out that the front right framing was rotted from water damage. Full quote was $4500 to replace everything. Well that wasn't in my budget so I opted to just replace the framing for $2600. Well here I am 2 years later with the exact same problem massive leak in the right corner. Today I started the demolition of the same area (thanks YouTube University) that Affordable RV supposedly repaired! What a hack job! My ladder isn't even screwed to any framing members, my marker lights aren't wired in, there is STILL rotted wood, molded wood, and COMPLETE separation in some of the framing members! So apparently they ONLY repaired the right side (if you want to call that a repair). I have left messages with answering service and emails with no response. I can say that I will never recommend this place for RV repair to anyone. I am ABSOLUTELY sure that I could have made better use of $2600 in repairing my toyhauler myself. I will be posting pictures very soon on Affordable RV's repair and you can judge for yourself!"
4,5,I cannot say enough good things about this place. We depend on our RV for our business. We need our RV to function on time all the time as it it used 50 weekends a year.  I can depend on Affordable RV to make sure we keep going. If we are not going we are not making money . Not only do they go above and beyond.....you just don't find places like this anymore.  We drive way out of the way to go here when we need to and it is always easy peasy.   If you want to go to a fancy expensive place that will long haul you  and run your bill up...this is not the place for you.....I can't say enough great things about the tech Mike....smart smart guy. No BS.  The owner is always great with follow up and warranty issues....we got a bad board from a different RV repair place while in Arizona.
4,5,Awesome customer service!  Very helpful and highly knowledgeable regarding rv parts and service. Would recommend to anyone looking for rv parts and service.  Allie and Al are really great!
5,5,"James the owner had a employee that was not sure of the work we needed, so the owner can out and corrected the problem. Thanks!"
5,5,"I have used Happy Hals on two (2) occasions and plan on using them a third time.

The first call involved my house battery charging system malfunctioning.  The technician arrived a little late, but the owner, James explained that the technician was delayed due to a lengthy repair, which is understandable.  The technician thoroughly tested the system and informed me that I had overfilled the battery with distilled water, which caused the issue. 

The second service call involved replacing my power converter.  I ordered the replacement part and when it arrived, I realized that I didn't have the skills necessary to do the work.  James handled the replacement personally and it took him less than an hour.

Now, I am going to have Happy Hals install a Sirius/XM radio antenna on the roof of my class C RV.  This may seem simple, but it involves drilling through the roof and running the cable inside the coach, which I will leave to an expert.

Update:

James came out to install a Sirius/XM antenna on the roof of my Class C RV.    He arrived in the promised timeframe and in just a little over an hour, had the antenna installed and connected to my in dash stereo system.  The work was clean and efficient.  Happy Hal's and James are a six ****** company."
5,5,"Great service!  Office staff very professional as got tech the phone to discuss the 12 CFC diagnose problem (funky battery disconnect switch I inadvertently turned off last RV Park I was in)(why don't they label it or at put in owner's manual?)?  Anyway, the tech Gordon troubleshot my buffoonery in switching the darned thing off in a little over a hour and  back on the road again to Yellowstone in short order.  I had called the local Camping World for service and they told us they had a week backlog.  Thanks Happy Hal's!  Stan B"

5,4,"I talked to the owner regarding my bill and I think we came to a fair settlement.  I believe the work they did was excellent.  The employee was able to diagnose the problem with my heater within 15 minutes, order the part and picked up the part later that same day."
5,5,Just awesome! They worked me in and Jim was right on time and great to talk to! He made quick work with a good diagnosis and I'm ready to be on the road again! Thanks Happy Hal's! I will recommend you to anyone and everyone!
5,5,"Customer service from Emily and Gordy was amazing. She had Gordy come out to service our Refrigerator within an hour. He put a new thermostat in and it's working like charm.Today was the beginning of a 3 month vacation, Gordy and Emily saved the day and a lot of food. Thank you."
5,5,"This is the first time we have used Happy Hal's and met tech Gordon. He is extremely knowledgeable, accommodating, and got the job done very quickly. He has done multiple repairs for us and we couldn't be more pleased. We previously used someone else and were not overly satisfied, but we found the real deal in Gordon and happy Hal's. Look no further, Gordon is your man, very honest and straightforward and takes pride in doing it correctly. Thank you, Gordon, so much for all your hard work and taking care of everything."
5,5,I had a good experience with Happy Hal's. My issue involved warranty work which meant phone calls and paid for in advance parts. James took care of all of it and when I arrived to have it installed he did so without problem.
5,5,They did a fantastic job repairing the air conditioner on the RV.  The rates were reasonable.  James Halford set up an appointment and actually arrived early.  Recommend this repair service
5,5,James and crew helped me with an annoying and ongoing problem with my Rv.  They communicated and kept me updated on their arrival which was earlier than scheduled.  I am very happy with their service and feel I have someone to call that I can trust and count on in the future!  I highly recommend Happy Hal's  for all Rv service needs!
5,5,thanks for sending Gordy  very knowledgeable  and experienced    jim james and now gordy  all very thorough   pam j
5,5,"We highly recommend Hal's service! 
We had 3 things needing electrical fixing in our RV, and Hal fixed all 3, without the purchase of any parts. Most knowledgable person I've met regarding RVs. Punctual and polite...we will not hesitate to call him back, or refer him to anyone.
Btw, his rate was not $130 per hour...it was $100 per hour, and well worth it. There was a $30 service fee, but what company doesn't charge a fee for showing up at your door?"
5,5,"Our tech, Gordy was friendly & helpful. Called to let me know he was in his way. He arrived about 8:30. Our window was between 8:am and 11:am."
5,5,James is an absolute gem. Walked me patiently through my rv orientation and inspection and stayed until he was absolutely sure I could manage on my own. I will go out of my way to get my campervan serviced with him.
5,5,"This is a slightly overdue from services provided by Gordon June 18, 2018 and a review of my recent services by Jim De Ram on Aug 30, 2018.

Gordon repaired the issues I was having with the TT not properly switching over from the generator to shore power,  the trailer connector needed replacing, and replacing a damaged safety brake cable.

We recently returned from my first trip since Gordon's service and I was pleased to see everything working as it should.  Gordon was also very service oriented, had great communication, and took time to answer some general maintenance questions I had.  This was my second great experience with Happy Hals.

Most recently, Jim De Ram serviced my trailer by replacing the power tongue jack, replacing leaking sink hardware, and installing a thumb valve on my Oxygenics shower head (great product, BTW!)  We needed this done before my wife was to take the TT for an 8-day tour.  

Jim bent over backwards to make this happen and, as I've come to expect of Happy Hal's, he was also a real pleasure to work with.  Jim was very communicative and service oriented.  We ran out of time for the lowest priority item on my list (replacing an unreliable bathroom vent), but he had already purchased the part.  Jim generously offered to install it without an additional trip charge when my wife returned from her trip.

Being as I scored great experiences 3 out of 3 times with Happy Hal's, I couldn't be more pleased or proud to recommend their techs to others.  A+."
5,5,"I was fortunate enough to find a 1996 winnebago brave in excellent condition. Excellent for its age that is. James from Happy Hals is beyond knowledgeable. When you have an older RV diagnosing issues can be very difficult. James has always found the issue, no matter how complicated, and saved me huge dollars because of his knowledge and efficiency. From suspension, engine and drive train work, to totally renovating an rv or repairing its many components, this guy is amazing. I honestly believe he could take the entire RV apart and put it back together piece by piece. I plan on writing a more detailed review listing the repairs he has done and the problem solving that has saved us many dollars and kept us on the road safely. Highly recommend."
5,5,"Great service, I had two others look at my air conditioner James even told me a lot of information over the phone free advise  (you don't see that these days)  they came out fixed the problem in no time. Don't call anyone else these guys know there stuff and get it done fast. I will only call them when I need help"
5,1,First thing you should know which I did that there is a $75 convenience fee for them to come to your location. The service technician was very nice and polite but getting paid by the hour and taking phone calls is not customer service. On top of that I helped him all five hours that he was working on a water leak in my camper. I even drove him to go get parts. But he could not give me a deal even though he could not of done it without my help. And then he left all the leftover parts and garbage in the camper and in my yard.
5,5,I was very happy with my recent RV service from Happy Hall's. Emily was very friendly and professional setting up my appointment. My repairman  Gordie came as scheduled and was very helpful in fixing my house battery problem in my class c Roadtrek. He was very knowledgeable and taught me some things that will help me in the future. Will definitely call them again when the need arises.
5,1,I recently had my heater repaired by Happy Hal's and I feel I was charged way too much.  The heater had a $20.00 part that needed replacing according to Jim (the repairman) .  He showed up in a hurry at the last minute and told me he wouldn't charge me for that visit.  He checked out the unit told me it needed the $20.00 part and he ordered it and told me he would be back early the next morning.  He called late in the afternoon said the part was in and I told him I was out 15 minutes from the house.  He waited and I let him take the furnace home that evening so he could repair it on his workbench.  He showed up the next morning 30 minutes later than he said (got caught up in a traffic jam) and he was not in a good mood.  he hastily installed the unit and wrote me a bill for $ 323.39.
5,5,"If you need any repair done on your  RV, James is the person to contact.  Made an appointment, he showed up that same afternoon.  Fixed  a leak on a pipe leading to my gray water tank.  Such a professional in his field and provides knowledge on how he is fixing  the problem. Finally an Honest company to deal with on repairs. Please call if you need any type of rv repair, don't  go anywhere  else..
James  is the man and the owner!

Thank you so much again, you have  customers  for  life....

5,5,We just had a great experience with Happy Hal's mobile RV Service! We have a class a diesel pusher that was having electrical problems. We called Jim and he was there on the same day right on time. Not only did he fix the problem right away he took extra time to answer any questions that we had about our RV as we are newbies. I highly recommend his service as he is very reliable and a very friendly person. Danny & Kathy
5,5,"Had a 12 volt no power electrical issue in our coach. Their tech Gordon arrived on time, was pleasant and knowledgeable.  Issue was diagnosed and repaired in little over an hour. Probably would've taken less time if I hadn't been peppering Gordon with questions about general RV maintenance and operation. I'm new to motorhome ownership and he was very helpful in answering my questions. Only negative of Happy Hals service is getting an appointment due to there busy schedule. Had to wait a week for the service call, but it was worth it."
5,4,"I received a phone call from the owner James who advised me that they had been out of town and unable to respond to my call. He was more than happy to come out the next day and take care of my issue, . So I am changing my review to show contact was made and will edit when service is complete."
5,5,"We were in need of a shower repair with a leak somewhere in the shower wall, as well as a fantastic fan repair. Called up James and got a repair scheduled the next day.

James is a young guy, but is a throwback to when service folks were polite and went the extra mile for customer satisfaction. He quickly diagnosed the issue in the shower and the fan, and had it repaired. All this right at our site. And the bill was less than what I had built up in my mind. I might add that James warranties his repairs and will make it right if there's an issue down the road.

Bottom line; here's a guy who knows his job, is honest, and is someone you'd be comfortable with in your rig. I'd give him 6 stars, but it's not an option."
5,5,"Thank you James you are AWESOME! He is not only very knowledgeable and found our problem right away, he is a very nice young man!! We will let Thousand Trails know about our great experience with you and your company! If you need RV work done, call JAMES!! 
Mark & Linda"
5,5,"I recommend Happy Hal's for your RV repairs. They do a good job and have fair prices, all of which seem hard to find in the RV industry. Will gladly use again for future needs! Thanks Happy Hal's"
5,5,"He was extremely helpful, on time , and very honest . 
Will always call him when I need RV repair. 
The best RV repair I have found ."
5,5,Happy Hal's (James Halford) fixed our electrical issue at a fair price! James is a pleasant young man with a ton of experience as he started helping his dad in the mobile RV business as a child.  We highly recommend him and if we have another problem traveling through Las Vegas he will be the first technician we call!
5,3,"I first saw Happy Hal's Mobile RV Repair on Yelp and I emailed them some questions.  I received a voicemail that evening answering all my questions.  Two weeks later I called Emely to schedule an appointment.  Originally the appointment was set for 9:30 but Emely changed it to 10:30 to squeeze somebody in before me.  I had my girlfriend wait at the storage facility as I was at work.  10:30 came and went.  At 11:00 AM, my girlfriend called and told me she was ready to leave when I called Emily and was told the mechanic was on his way.  I left for lunch and beat the mechanic to the storage facility.  Again I called Emily.  He arrived just over an hour late.  The only communication from Emely on this was when I called.

The mechanic showed up not knowing what I wanted.  I wanted the generator serviced and the Hot water heater fixed.  I was hoping for some time after that to have him just look at the chassis as I was having Battery problems.  I just replace both chassis batteries and wanted verification this was the problem.

The Mechanic was good.  He answered all my questions.  He knew what he was doing and did exactly what I wanted to the generator.  I had a special request to replace the square head drain plug to the generator with a normal hex head bolt.  When I tried this myself, I was unable to get it off as it was cross threaded and I did not have a square head socket.  He struggled with the drain plug, but finally got it removed.  He also changed the air filter and fuel filter.  This took just about 3 hours and then he looked at my water heater, diagnosed the problem and told my girlfriend he needed to order the parts to get it fixed.  He never did look at the Chassis.  

I am giving you 3 stars.  I am happy with the work;  I am upset about the hour my girlfriend had to wait and the lack of communication from Emely.  Today I went to test the Generator as I went back to work before he was done yesterday and I saw a greasy mess on the front of the generator.  It looks like I did the work instead of having a professional do it."
5,5,"It's such amazing service!!
Gordie come to my place and fix my generator and is work amazing!!
So professional and also is save my money
Thanks gordie I want to give you 10 stars but 5 is the limit!!
Highly recommended !!!"
5,5,"Great Service - Gordie came out on time

1. Fixed the Hydraulic Leak in my jacks
2. Replace Stair Motor
3. Replace Springs on all four Jacks
4. Rewire Electrical System - Air Condition Works perfectly

Getting parts was easy thru Gordie and Johnny Walker RV (Dusty)

5,5,"From beginning to end, this was as good as it gets.  Emily, who took my repair requests (and a few changes) was as helpful and delightful as could be.  

The technician (whose name I forget), was knowledgeable, capable, and had great communication.

I would not hesitate to recommend Happy Hal's, which will be my ""go-to"" for future needs."
5,5,"Call James at Happy Hals FIRST if you care about getting your RV fixed right.  We have a coach and the slides and jacks were not working.  We took the coach to a local RV dealer/repair shop.  After keeping it most of the day they told us our hydraulic motor needed to be replaced.  This would cost about $2,000.  We were pretty sure it was NOT the motor so we called James.  He located the problem within 15 minutes (a faulty breaker) and had the slides and jacks working within a half an hour.  

There are no words for how grateful we are to James and Happy Hals.  James saved us probable weeks in the shop and thousands of dollars in unnecessary repair costs.  Seriously....call Happy Hals FIRST."
5,5,It was a pleasure working with Happy Hal's and the technician Gordy. He serviced our Onan generator (and helped coordinate the benefits with our RV extended warranty).  His tips on routine maintenance were invaluable.  We will call Happy Hal's for all our RV repairs in the future!
5,5,"I would like to update my review.  The owner of the company called me after he saw my review.  He was upset at the service I received and apologized profusely.  He wanted to know what he could do to keep my business.  On their website, I found this paragraph ""Happy Hal's holds a solid reputation of excellent Workmanship and Good Moral Integrity. Any mistakes made by Happy Hals are held responsible too Happy Hals and are always either fixed or improved at our expense.""  I feel this company went the extra mile for customer service.  I feel this company has good moral integrity and therefore I will continue to use them for all my RV needs."
5,5,"Great service!  and it starts right away when you first call and talk to Emily who sets everything up.  She was so helpful, friendly and took time to answer all my questions.  Then Gordy and James did great work and are very knowledgeable!  Had them get our generator running, check out our level and repair our A/C (which is a baseboard A/C in a 40 ft diesel pusher).   I will use them every time from now on!!  Thank you Happy Hal's!!!"
5,5,"I am so pleased with the service I received - he was so helpful and knowledgeable and pleasant.  He knew right off what the problem was.  With so many unethical people out there, I was shocked how amazing he was.   I only regret that I am only able to rate him by 5 stars."
1,1,"Horrendous customer service after you actually purchase from them! They make a lot of promises and will say anything to make the sale. Especially Matt. Definitely go somewhere else, anywhere else.
Sincerely, Tim Allen
BLUEBIRD FREIGHT LLC."
1,1,"I could write for days about the horrendous experience with these crooks, but I'll stick to the main points for brevity. 

- Once I made my selection on a 'premium' vehicle, they said it would take 2-3 weeks for it to be ready. I paid my deposit.
- 3 weeks later they tell me the truck is entirely dead and they need approval to have repairs done. A week later they approved, and another week later they changed their mind.
- Selected another vehicle. Had the exact same outcome as the first one, with about the same time line.
- Selected another vehicle from the list sent to me, one hour after it was sent to me - sorry, that vehicle is sold. 
- Selected another vehicle. - ONE MONTH LATER IT DIED. I have a $26k paper weight, that they very generously offer to give a bid on the repairs for. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THESE PEOPLE."
1,1,"I dont know how to begin with, all the employees who work here suck big time specifically TODD WHITT , ERICK J and their managers(stay away from these guys) ,and all the employees who answer the phone calls .They are so rude. I have decoded some codes like their overnight means 3-4 days, their 1 day means 1 wk and 2 wks is their 2 months . I paid for my truck on 10/5/17 and today is 10/23/17 , and i havnt got my truck . I am tired of calling these guys . they dont answer your phone, emails . I am gona post this publicly as well so that who so ever is buying next will not go through all this crap . This is our second truck from them and this is the way they treat their customers . None of their employee contacted me and gave me any update unless i call them and beg them for the information. I swear i would sue them for all the harassment and inconvenience but i am not an a**hole like them ."
5,5,"Great place to stay and camp. Linda Hogan, the manager of the park is wonderful!  The camp ground was very clean, had plenty of space, and laundry facilities"
5,5,"This was a great little campground. The staff were very nice and the sites were well maintained. They don't have a lot of activities for families, although they do have some playground equipment. I will definitely be saving this place in my favourites for future travels."
5,4,"We called ahead and lady was very nice. When we got here they were ready for us with a pull-thru site. Nice price for 50 amp service. No cable or satellite TV, but they have sewer. The shower was terrific. They are in separate rooms with a toilet and sink. They were clean and shower head was a pulsating one. Lots of hot water. The site had trees and was level. They are big long sites. Only downside we saw was it's next to a busy road. The restroom had 1 toilet and 3 sinks. The shower room had no electric outlets to use hair dryer. No cable or satellite TV. We would stay here again, but only for 1 or 2 nights, traveling thru. It's a nice stop over."
5,5,The campground host was very friendly and accommodating. The grounds were very well kept and the bathhouses clean. Full service hook up for RVs and the prices daily and weekly very fair! The campground is minutes from the Chunute Air Museum and only 20 minutes from St. Joseph where there are incredible antique shops.
2.5,2,"I did a RV relocation for Apollo motorhomes in July 2017.  I was scheduled to pick up the RV in Las Vegas at noon and drop it off in L.A the next day. I arrived 10 minutes before noon on a Monday. There where about 18 groups of people waiting to be helped with there RV. I waited for 6 hours and 22 minutes before they called my name. The RV was outside waiting for me the entire time. It took Apollo literally 10 minutes to give me the RV after my name was called. The staff was nice but very very very slow, maybe they needed more workers helping out with the contracts & RV walk through. Many of the people there including myself was very frustrated with the wait times. I could have drove to L.A and back to Vegas in the time I waited in that office. Dropping the RV off in L.A was a breeze, took 5 minutes. The RV I rented was very clean, only about 5,000 miles on it. I'm giving them a 2 star review because of the ridiculous wait times. Please hire on more people to help with checking in Apollo."
2.5,5,"You know what, I'm completely impressed. Yea it takes a long time bc there's a lot of important things when renting an RV as opposed to renting a car. Our RV was BRAND NEW! and I was very happy! We came from GA and rented the RV for 7 days to travel around. Best time of our lives in a nice RV!"
2.5,4,"We actually pick up our Winnebago Minnie Winnie 22R (Apollo Pioneer) at the Seattle/Tacoma location for a one way rental to Las Vegas.  We received an Email before pickup that they were going to be very busy since it was the last day they would be open till after July 4th.  We decided to show up before they had opened and there was someone there.  The checkout process was fairly smooth.  They were still prepping the RV so we were on the round around 1015 after getting there around 0830.  Got the value package which included mileage and lower deductible because of the mileage we planned on covering.  The unit was very clean and had about 7500 miles on it.  Make sure you do a thorough walk around.  The gentleman who did it with me found damage I wouldn't have seen, thanks!  The Pioneer is a nice basic unit.  Spacious enough us (2 adults, 1 child).  The RV comes with pretty much all you need for basic cooking. Pots, pans, utensils, 4 cup coffee maker, 2 slice toaster.  The fridge is great, has a separate freezer and worked well even when parked in a hot parking lot.  Storage is adequate.  Bathroom is nice with a operate shower stall. The value pack gives you chairs, table, blanket, pillow, sheets. This is stuff that you could probably get at a discount store for less then $200 so unless you need the mileage or the lower deductible, pass.

The driving experience is as could be expected with a old Ford van front end with a big box attached to the back of it.  The visibility is actually pretty good.  The car audio unit was actually pretty good.  It had a large screen that had a rearview camera view available at all times.  Great , not only for backing up, but for lane changes too.  It had a USB dongle which worked great with my iPhone, but no mini plug for aux input.  No bluetooth that I could find.

The Pioneer had the smaller 5.4L V8, which was sufficient to move the unit.  Suffered on some of the steeper grades.  The cruise control did everything it could to maintain speed.  It was great for down hill, where it would use engine braking to maintain speed.  For uphill and even slight grades it would downshift and make for some serious racket.  Overall averaged about 10MPG (23.5l/100km).  In a crosswind you will need to hold a pretty good crab to keep it straight. The front end A/C worked well for the driving end of the rig and could rid most of the stuffiness in the rest of the unit and a warm day.  On a hot day if passengers will be in the back you might need the rooftop A/C (need to run generator).

The fresh water tank was full, as was the LPG tank, and the RV's batteries.  The level lights could be a little bit more informative, showing only Full, 2/3, 1/3, Empty.  The Batteries never left full.  The LPG tank almost immediately went to 2/3's, which got me a little concerned that I was going to need LPG pretty quickly.  If never left 2/3's for the rest of the 10 days of the rental although we only used the generator ( I assuming the largest consumer) a little over an hour.  Trying to be a little conservative the water tanks were good for a little over a day for the fresh, gray, and black tanks.

Servicing the RV was easy.  The dump tube is stored in the rear bumper.  Pick up or bring a nice pair of rubber gloves for servicing.  Also be aware a lot of gas stations in the US limit credit card purchases to $95-$100 if you swipe (dip) your card at the pump.  This might not give you a full tank (Especially important when returning unit).

We hit Yellowstone, Moab, Bryce Canyon, and Zion.  Most spots are very RV friendly and parking wasn't that big of a problem (July 4th week).  There are some lots and roads that do not allow RV's, but definitely not a show stopper.

The return in Las Vegas, was not as casual as a rental car return, but it wasn't painful.  Same kind of walk around.  No problem with leaving any left over supplies it the unit, I am sure the beer, etc didn't go to waste.  You have to return the RV with the gray and black tanks empty.  The closest RV park is at Sam's town.  They charge $15 to dump.

Looking back I thought we would need the generator more, especially for A/C while driving, but that really wasn't the case.  We parked at RV parks every night so we had shore power.  If you plan on going off the grid (boon docking) you will probably need it more.

A very good overall experience.  We are thinking about buying an RV now.  If you have any question drop me a note."
2.5,5,"Best RV booking experience EVER! Shout out to Vera and Camille, thank you for your wonderful, lovely customer service. The maintenance crew completely dialed in our RV, it was super clean and they took lots of care explaining the in and outs of the RV. Apollo offers all new RV's, ours was brand new and in perfect working condition. I can HIGHLY recommend this outfit, they go the extra mile (pun intended) and made our entire transaction pleasant, organized and wonderful.
I will definitely be booking my next RV from them again!
FIVE STARS!!!!!!"
2.5,5,"It does take a while which is to be expected so don't go there expecting to leave in 1 hr... more like 2-2 1/2 and get there at 11:15,11:30 but everyone was nice and helpful, clean, brand new RVs, I'd rent again!"
2.5,5,"We rented a RV from this location for the thanksgiving holiday.  We were blessed and had a totally different experience comparing to some of the people who rented during peak season.  We loved it.  The staffs were friendly and courteous.  The vehicle was clean and new.  The price was the lowest we can find.  When we return, the check out process was a breeze, less than 10 minutes.  We will definitely use them again if we will need another RV in the future.

Yes, the check in process was long, way longer than renting a car (2+ hour).  However, given so many paperwork and options to go over, I think they (Cameron) did an excellent job.  We weren't pushed to purchase their insurance either.  Everything was explained very though and clear even the rental agents were down to 1 person on that day (normally they have 3).

Cameron was very organized, had a great personality and easy to work with.  He tried his best to work with 4 waiting families at the same time.  He bundled the demo with 3 families in order to help us get moving as fast as we could.  That was very nice of him.

Before we got there, I called to confirm our vehicle will be ready.  Jennifer was very patient and answered all my questions before we got there.  

One thing to watch out is if you need to change the number of day you rent, the rental office and reservation line in US can't help you.  You have to call Australia (office won't open until 1:30 local time).  If you can't wait, you will incur international charge on you cell phone.  

Because we have to return our rental car, our group (6 people) were lingering in their lobby for hours.  They were very accommodating.  All all, we had a great experience."
2.5,5,"This is a great place to rent an RV. Cameron and the ladies at the decks are super friendly and they got us in and out quickly despite it being crowded. The rig was in perfect condition and ran great

Only complaint was it would have been nice to be able to drop it off on Sunday instead of Monday, but I guess all of the RV companies are closed on Sunday's. 

Will definitely rent from Apollo again. So much better than El Monte!"
2.5,4,"Apollo gehört zu einem der großen RV/Wohnmobil-Vermietern in den USA. Alle gängigen Wohnmobile können bei Apollo gemietet werden, in vielen Stationen, die über das Land verteilt sind. Wir hatten die Gelegenheit (Vitamin B) für einen Tag ein neues Sondermodell zu testen, es trägt den Namen JUCY.
 (Siehe Foto unten) JUCY mit uns im Death Valley
Das Konzept ist einfach: Man nehme einen herkömmlichen, nicht zu kleinen, PKW und baue ihn zum Camper um. Das erfordert viel Überlegung und Detailarbeit. 
Der Innenraum wird bis zum letzten Winkel genutzt. So ist direkt hinter den beiden Vordersitzen eine Sitzbank angebracht mit Klapptisch, an dem man essen, trinken etc. kann. Nicht sehr bequem, aber es geht. Unter der Sitzbank Stauraum  das ist aber auch der einzige. Wer Jucy mietet, muss sehr spartanisch mit Gepäck sein.
Wird die Hecktür geöffnet, hat man Zugang zu einer kleinen Spüle (kleiner Frisch- und Abwassertank ist eingebaut), einem Gasflammen-Herd, Stauraum mit kompletten Set an für zwei Personen benötigtem Geschirr inkl. Töpfe, Pfannen etc., einer recht geräumigen Kühlbox (elektrisch gekühlt) und dies und das.
Auf dem Dach der Schlafraum. Mit wenigen Griffen und elektrischer Hydraulik ist eine Leiter ausgeklappt und das Schlafzimmer geöffnet (mit integrierter Beleuchtung). Reichlich Platz für eine Person, kuschelig eng für zwei.
Durch die besondere Lackierung fällt das Fahrzeug überall auf. Ständig waren neugierige Blicke auf uns gerichtet. Das Fahren ist sehr angenehm, halt PKW-Feeling, alles sehr wendig, überschaubar. Man kommt auch an enge Stellen, an denen ein richtiger RV (Recreation Vehicle/Wohnmobil) sonst passen muss. Allerdings heißt es, auf die Höhe zu achten, denn wenn man drinnen sitzt, vergisst man schnell, dass das Dach erheblich höher ist als beim Normalfahrzeug.
Nachteilig ist sicherlich die Enge. Hinzu kommt, dass sich die Vordersitze nicht nach hinten verschieben lassen, da die Rückbank dies verhindert. Bei Körpergrößen über 175 cm wird es für den Fahrer unbequem. Bei Jucy ist der hard-core-camper gefragt, der sich mit wenig begnügt und das abenteuerliche Vagabundenleben liebt. Und die enorme Mobilität schätzt. Und sich freut, dass Jucy sehr viel weniger Sprit verbraucht als jeder RV.
Der Service an der Apollo-Station war bei unserem Besuch einwandfrei. Von hier zum Flughafen sind es ca. 6 Meilen, zum Stadtzentrum ca. 9 Meilen. Gleich um die Ecke ist ein Supermarket (Albertson's), bei dem man seine Erstbesorgungen erledigen kann. Ein wichtiger Punkt bei einer RV-Übernahme.
Fazit: Wer Mobilität mit Freiheit schätzt, wer sich einschränken kann  der wird Freude an Jucy haben. Wer beim Camp-Touren Komfort bevorzugt, dafür Einschränkungen in der Mobilität in Kauf nimmt, wird eher zum herkömmlichen RV greifen. Vier Sterne für Jucy (und Apollo)."
2.5,1,"Very poor customer service.  (a) Waited almost an hour after our appointment time to get our vehicle. (b) Did not go over all functions of the vehicle - as a first time RVer, it would have been nice to know how to lock the fridge. (c) Poor service returning vehicle - Blanca in service center was very rude and even snapped at me.  Ended up having a lot more hidden fees than were expecting. Overall, had a very poor experience as a first time RVer with this company - while it didn't turn me off from RVing, I will be taking my business elsewhere."
2.5,1,"Horrible horrible horrible experience. Rip off place! Staff is extremely unprofessional, unfriendly and rude. During our pick up we spent half of the day waiting to fill out all paperwork and to pick up the vehicle, stuff was super slow. The RV itself was new and with low milage but very cheaply made. But the worst are hidden fees. We were coming to Burning Man, and were informed about 300$ cleaning fee for extremely dirty vehicle on top of paying 700$ Burning Man fee, we knew that we'll have to pay it because of the desert dust. But suddenly we were informed we have to pay 200$ fee for dirty dishes when we returned the vehicle. Really? isn't that included in general cleaning fee? Our 1500$ bond was taken for drainage pipe that came off during our driving back. 2 weeks passed already and it is still wasn't processed, and we still are waiting on how much we'll end up paying for that ""damage"".
Do your research! there are much better companies in Las Vegas!"
2.5,1,A very terrible customer service try to cancel my reservation for pass 3 week I called 1800 reservation line never go through when it vanilla went through they put. Me on hold for almost 30 mins then hang up on me no one want to help they give u the run around I been try to get to hold of them for pass 3 weeks online on the phone no responds and went to the rental place they say they can't help me I can't cancel with them I have to call the 1800 number I told them I can not get through with them all they say sorry we can't do anything about it when I got through it was the los Angeles branch answered n they told me they will try to get the law Vegas branch to contact me but I got the call from Australia the last don't listen a word in trying to tell her she say because we just reserve the cancellation today is under 14 days so I have to pay the full amount of your reservation which is $2500 that I never even get to go on my vacation I have told her I been try to call the 1800 line been try to go online chat been to the location n no one have  acknowledge me she don't care she just say u have to pay the full amount when I ask to speak to a manager or higher up she told me she is the highest up there .... If this is the system they have why would people want to go there there process time is slow waiting time is long.... Give a try When u call the reservation line all they do is ring ring ring then hang up so please tell me how can people get through and cancel or ask any questions
2.5,1,"Be VERY VERY careful renting from this duplicitous Australian company during Burning man. 
Unfortunately I want to like them bc they're an aussie company but local Staff is very inept and rushed, they will not tell you your full options or choices and will price gouge you either before or after the burn because you're a yuppie and this is America. 

They do not tell clearly enough you that the vehicle must be brought back sparkling (ie no dust even tho they have cleaning facilities on site and you could easily go to a carwash but no they'll charge you $700 on top) , nor will they give you the courtesy of offering you mile packs / of which they are price gouging you charging you anyway per mile. 
Either way, you're gonna get ripped off and should check out elsewhere / Juicy rentals for a smaller vehicle or indeed rvshare.com ‍

Had no prob with the LA store per se, (altho the toilet was rented to us FULL!!!) apart from unbelievable multi hour LONG LINES during pick up and drop off but the staff do not care here. Customer service is a joke."
2.5,1,"My rental experience was literally the worst customer service experience of my entire life.  I dealt with Vera in the office to rent and return the vehicle, and she was rude, condescending, disrespectful, and incompetent from start to finish.  

Here are a few highlights from our interactions:

1. I walk into the office at 2:45 p.m., as I was advised pick-up time is between 12 p.m. - 4 p.m.  Vera is behind the desk.  She doesn't acknowledge me or say hello, despite being the only person behind the desk.  The first words out of her mouth are ""You're a little late, aren't you?""  I replied ""No, I am not.  My pick-up time is between 12 and 4, and it is before 3.""  Already, in a matter of seconds, she has made a fun and exciting experience terrible.  She responds ""OK.""  No apology, no my mistake, still no hello/how are you/how can I help.  

2. Next, she says that I didn't do online check-in (this clearly bothered her), so I need to go to the computer.  She just walks away, no instruction or guidance on what is next.  I complete the online check-in, and proceed to seek out her office after finishing to, see what is next.  She barely acknowledges me again, looks at her computer, and begins to complain that I didn't do it right because she can't see it on her screen.  I respond that I entered every field that it asked for, clicked submit, and it said successful.  She continues to blame me, which I later realize will become a trend - she does not know how to use her computer... at all, but is great at convincing herself that it is someone else's fault.

3. Her disrespectful and condescending tone continues for the entire process, which takes a very long time due to her pace of work (and because she routinely just gets up and walks away without any explanation).  Throughout the process I am trying not to freak out, scream at her about how awful she is at her job, and request to have someone with respect take over.  I resist in hopes that she will be done soon.  Eventually her part is over, about 10-15 later than it should have been if she was a capable employee (or cared).  She dumps me in the lobby and says someone else will take it from there, nothing else - no timelines, not introduction of who I will be speaking to next, no explanation of what happens next.  To be fair, the remainder of the check-out process was smooth, although I had to wait 10 more mins and do a vehicle inspection with a stranger that rented a different model RV (which was odd).  However, the person doing it was nice and competent, so it seemed great in comparison.

4. Upon returning the RV, I once again get Vera, and she starts off every bit as rude and disrespectful as she left off.  No greeting, no eye contact, condescending.  I thought that maybe she was just having an awful day, but no, she is just a repulsive human being that hates her job.  She again struggles to use her computer, and tries to charge me $350+ because I went over the prepaid mileage.  I advised that I paid $106 for $500 miles, and used about 650, so there is no way that $.45 per extra mile comes out to anywhere near her calculation.  She becomes irritated that I question her, blames her computer system, and walks away without explanation (as per normal).  She needed to get someone else that knows how to operate a computer.  The new person can tell that I prepaid 500 miles, but between the two of them they can't figure out the departing and returning mileage, and just say that the computer says that it will cost $106 (probably because they are just adding another 500 mile package instead of doing it properly).  I know that this is wrong, but I need to leave quickly, so I just say fine.  I make it a point to tell her several times that I am in a hurry, but she works at her usual pace, walking off, taking phone calls, chatting with other employees.  Absolutely awful.  As you can imagine, she never once utters thank you for renting with us/have a great trip etc.  Nope, not even a thanks or goodbye.   

I would never do business with this place again, under any circumstances.  I would gladly pay hundreds of dollars extra to rent from anywhere else.  During the process I learn that they almost never rent vehicles to Americans, so every interaction is a one-time only sale, and they clearly know it.  

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague."
2.5,1,"I had the worst experience with the Las Vegas branch of Apollo. The RVs themselves are great! Really clean and new with low mileage. This company offers really good relocation deals and other offers. 

However, the staff is very unprofessional. Vera was working very slow with a condescending attitude. She asked my kids to wait outside cause they were ""distracting"" her. Then she would always go out of the office to check other people in. The whole experience with her felt uncomfortable, unfriendly, and downright rude.

Finally finishing the paperwork at 10am we were informed that we couldn't drive off the lot until after 12! I would understand if they didn't have the RV but it was standing in the lot ready to go yet we still had to wait. I have 2 little twins who were exhausted and bored and hungry. It was a terrible, disorganized, unprofessional, and unfriendly experience because of the staff."
2.5,1,"Just the facts:

Sept 7th, Monday, 12:30pm.
The Vegas Apollo branch is closed because it's Labor Day.  I know that we need to return the RV the next day with a full tank of gas so I stop at the TravelCenters gas station on Dean Martin Dr. in Vegas to fill it up.  I let the pump work until it clicks and stops, which normally indicates that the tank is full. I look at the gas tank gauge and notice it's a hair below full.  It's not entirely unusual - I've had vehicles before that don't show completely full because either the truck is on a slight incline, or the gauge is off, or the sensor in the tank is defective.  I take a photo just in case, print my gas receipt ($100) as evidence, and assume that I will be able to reasonably explain when returning the RV the next morning, in just a few hours.

Sept 8th, Tuesday, 6:47am.
On the way to return the RV I stop at the Sportsmans Mini Mart Shell Station at 5660 Boulder Highway, which is 0.3 miles away from the Apollo branch.  I stop to top off the gas tank.  Again, I let the pump work until it clicks and stops, print out my receipt ($10), and head over to the branch.

Sept 8th, Tuesday, around 8am or so.
Our RV is inspected, found clean, without any damage, etc.  We sit down to do the final checkout and our sales person (don't remember the name and the rental agreement invoice says ""Generated By: $Identity.FullName"" and has no other identifiable sales person information) informs us that we will be charged for a full tank of gas ($110) because it was being returned at less than full.

I take out both of my gas receipts, which have date and time stamps, and explain that I filled up the tank twice, most recently just a few minutes ago, less than a mile away.  She refused to even look at my receipts, repeating that everyone was warned to return the vehicles full.

I explain again that we made every reasonable effort and retained receipts as evidence.  She refused again to even look at the receipts and continues to repeat that everyone was warned.  She insists that they always fill up the vehicles and never have this problem.

I respond that I understand, but clearly there is something going on with this vehicle.  I suggest that we take it across the street to check - there is literally a gas station across the street from the branch.  Literally across the street.  She looks at me and says ""I am not going to do this with you right now.  Everyone was warned.""

I ask her ""So, I filled up the RV yesterday and again today.  What would you do in my place?""

She answers ""I would call the Apollo number.""

My wife, who is sitting next to me, asks her ""So, help me understand, we were just at the gas station down the street, 0.3 miles from the branch, minutes away from returning the RV, and you want us to call the headquarters in Australia to ask them for help with the gas gauge - rather than having this conversation here, now?""

She answers ""Yes.""  The entire time she refused to once look at our gas receipts or acknowledge that there could be an issue with the gas gauge.

In the end, after having filled up the vehicle twice, we were charged $110 fee for a gas tank which was full but where a gauge was just a hair short of the full marker."
2.5,1,"Don't waste your time with this company. Laurel was our sales rep and he was always too busy to take our calls or talk on the phone. They have a parking lot full of RVs but could not rent us one - after stringing us along for several days- because their parent company is based in Australia and had closed for the day when we arrived at noon.  Terrible communication, terrible customer service. We wasted way too much time with them. Find another dealer."
2.5,1,"This review is strictly for the company, NOT the staff. If it was not for the FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL staff, this place would get rated NEGATIVE ZERO! One star is for the staff's help and how hard they work. THEY WERE GREAT! :)

Beware of the following: 
1. Company says it gives you 2 hours of wait time prior to coming in and a little less time if you pre-register. NOT! We pre-registered, came in at 11:58AM when our appointment was at 12pm and we did not get out of there until after 3pm. We wasted a whole day of our trip/vacation. 
SUGGESTION: Go in 2 hours before your so-called appointment time. 

2. Short staff: It's not the staff's fault things take long. Treat them well b/c they are friendly and they work so hard to keep things moving along. I work in customer service and social service and I know what it takes to run a smooth office with smooth systems in place, and this place does not have the latter, which is a reflection of the company. 
SUGGESTION: If you scheduled for a 2 day vacation, make sure you consider one day of that just to get your RV especially if it's a Friday that you're picking up. 

3. Hidden costs: We were charged $15 to dump our waste, which we did not know we had to pay for, mileage cost is about $.40/mile if you don't get a mileage package. 
SUGGESTION: Get the mileage package. It will save you time/effort in calculating and money. 

Overall, our vacation was great! Luckily, our vacation did not rely on our contract with this company. A group of us who went were glad we experienced this, but that would be our last. We def won't return to Apollo."
2.5,3,"Breakdown:

5 stars for renting brand new RVs (ours had only 6000 miles on it, although, you never know exactly the model/size you are going to get, even though you rent a specific model; they just give you one that meets your sleeping capacity)

4 stars for friendliness

4 stars for getting us on the road quickly

4 stars for having the RV stocked with utensils, pots, pans, etc. (though we did have to buy a number of items at walmart, like a salad bowl, sharp knife, scissors, swiffer, sewer tank chemicals, etc.)

3 stars for competitive pricing (newer RVs for the same price as the nastier RVs rented by el monte and Cruise America)

2 stars for not being able to handle the crowd of people that showed up to rent/check-in vehicles on our return (it took us over an hour to return the RV and get on the road back to the airport; luckily I caught one of the cab drivers dropping off a family and he agreed to wait for us to take us back to the airport)

2 stars for closing at noon on Saturday and not allowing an after-hours drop-off return (our plane was delayed getting in to Vegas, and they told us if we did not get there by 12:30 we would have to wait until Monday to pick up our RV)

2 stars for not renting bicycles and bicycle racks (the lady actually told me that people don't bike around there; really? people don't bike in Southern Utah?

1 star for hidden fees/charges/misleading quotations (the quote they send lists a bunch of items like bedding, hygene kits, etc., that are ""included in the quoted rate"" but which are not actually included when you make your reservation; they will not reimburse cab fare unless you actually have the receipt)

1 star for not checking that the sewer pipe was properly cleaned out (Someone must have pooped and released the black handle without taking off the sewer pipe cap and without having the sewer hose hooked up, so the first time I went to take off the cap I had sewage explode into my face.)

All-in-all; if I were renting an RV in Vegas again next month, I would probably use them again because the RVs are new, and there are not better options."
2.5,1,"This office located in Las Vegas. Customer service is very bad. People who work in the office no pay attention to customers. Check-in process it takes couple hours. We are customers of many years. And for us this situation was surprised. What happens?????  New management or..... Change the workers. Do something, please. 
Worst time in my life (when you ready go to vacation and met unprofessional people)."
4,1,I used their online reservation request and the didn't get back to me within 3 days so I sent another request and still no answer. I have called both of their phone numbers multiple times and always get a busy signal.
4,3,Would probably only spend one night here while traveling through. We felt really squished in our site . Was kinda upset when we found out the wi fi did not work with apple products. None the less it was a place to spend the night with pretty easy access. All the paperwork seemed slow. Due to everything running in the slow paper mode.
4,4,"Great stay!  Grounds were immaculate. Food at the restaurant next door was really tasty. My husband had the steak special and was surprisingly good since it was so well priced. 
The check in clerk was friendly and helpful. Bathrooms were very clean and spacious. I would stay here again!"
4,5,"We just spent three nights in our RV at the Hitchin' Post and loved it there. They do have quite a few long term residences, but the sites were very nicely kept. I have experienced other places with trashy long terms. I especially liked the security gates which keep out potential trouble. The folks in the office were very friendly and helpful. We found the bathrooms were nice and clean.  We needed a place at the north end of town and this fit the bill perfectly.  Not super fancy but clean, comfortable and well-kept, a super value for the price."
4,4,"I will stay here again. Clean, friendly, and roomy RV sites.  Great salt water pool, clean showers and laundry.  I loved watching the jets overhead, but they can be very loud at times, otherwise it is a quiet campground.  We have a 38 ft motor home pulling a 24 ft enclosed trailer, and this parks staff was very accommodating."
4,2,"Pros:  Clean.  Decent amenities.  Seems secure.

Cons: WiFi is non existent.  Neighborhood around the park is less than desirable."
4,4,"Clean, quiet, nice people, wonderful pool!  
Far enough away from the Las Vegas Hustle, but close enough to be accessible to all the nightlife.  The RV park is gated with remotes for tenants.  The bathrooms were clean and secure.  The showers were great with enough room to maneuver.  The saltwater swimming pool was inviting and aways cleaned every morning.  There are two dog runs and a doggie bath area.  I would give the Hitchin' Post RV Park 5 stars if there was some sort of shade (netting) over the pool (really too hot in Vegas to spend mid-day in the pool)."
4,5,Friendly staff nice level pull through sites.  Dog run and dog shower which is great for the pups!  Pool looked great bathrooms clean with several shower stalls which had private dressing rooms.  Laundry room was huge.  We saw several staff cleaning up the park and it had its own restaurant which for us was a good take out they also had dine in with a full bar with goos music.  Would certainly stay again
4,5,"Very nice RV park with helpful staff, clean and spacious bathroom facilities, dog runs, and even a fitness center. Close the the Vegas strip and the airport, this was a convenient place to stay the night before we had to return our RV to Cruise America. There is even a sister steak house and beer garden right next door."
4,4,"We stayed here for a total of 3 nights. One on the way up to Utah and two on the way back home. 
Pros: 
*Gated
*Swimming pool
*Showers
*Pretty clean
*Location
*Hook ups


Cons:
*WiFi or lack there of. It says there is free WiFi. That is true if you manage to get connected and stay connected. It is very ""finicky"". They have multiple WiFi networks but it still takes up to 20 minutes to get connected to one. Once it said I was connected I thought I was good. I checked on it about 30 minutes after checking emails continuously and saw that I wasn't logged in anymore and had used up a lot of my own data. One of the deciding factors staying here was that we needed WiFi. My husband has to work on the road when we travel and wasn't able to get work done because he would spend hours trying to log back in. Before we came back so O called and spoke to the gentleman about the WiFi. He said that they have it and wasn't sure why it didn't work. I said we need to have it before we come back. He assured me they did and there were no issues. When we checked in the front desk lady said that it is finicky and you have to turn WiFi on and off and try with several of the networks. We did all that and it only worked a few times and would log back out after a few minutes. It also said incorrect password sometimes even though it was the correct one. I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the WiFi issue. Because it's a big part of why we stay somewhere I have to take away a star. 

We will probably stay here again if we can figure out the WiFi situation. We really liked it overall."
4,4,The sites are well maintained with full hookups and cable. Staff is friendly and helpful. They dog runs with a dog wash area. Bathrooms are clean and secure. We stayed 3 days and enjoyed our stay. We felt safe and did not worry about leaving our things when we went out.
4,5,"Stayed here over the weekend, the motel side Charles checked me in gave me a room by the office which was cool cause I was alone with a almost 2 year old. But Mikey stole the show when my child decided to flood my room Mikey went out of his way to calm me down an help me out. He was a total sweetheart. I would deffidently come back. Thank you Charles an Mikey for making my stay comfortable."
4,5,"This is a clean and secure place!
Kim, the woman who answered the phone and checked me in was super friendly and efficient.  
The bathrooms are clean and the pool is nice.  There is a steakhouse and saloon on the premises which seem like one of those 60's steakhouses that your parents took you to.  Good food and good prices.
Would definitely recommend to a friend!"
4,5,Love this park. Very secure. Great people. Level pads. We will come back here again and again. Laundry room is great and clean. Bebe loved the dog park. And has a bar and restaurant with great food
4,4,We have stayed at the hitching post several times in the last year. It is one of the better deals in Las Vegas. They keep it reasonably clean. On the downside both times I've been here it's taken 30 minutes to check in. Yes it is insane.
4,5,I have to be honest. We found this with the all stays rv app. When we got into the neighborhood i was getting nervous. It's not the best neighborhood.  When we pulled up the the campground office i got a little more nervous. But that nervousness was quickly stopped once we started talking to the very friendly and courteous staff. Once inside the gated and secured campground i was majorly impressed. This was one of the nicest campgrounds i have ever been too at a very fair price. The campground was so nice and we enjoyed it so much that on our return trip back from California we made sure to make it back to this place and spent another night there. We also ate dinner at the steakhouse/saloon on the property where we were impressed yet again. Great food and quantity at a more than fair price. All in all I can't recommend this campground enough. I just hope there will be a space available on my next visit to the Las Vegas area.
4,5,"Hitchin Post RV Park.. is top notch. It provides all the ammendities.
I would stay there again and again while visiting Vegas!!"
4,4,"I started to go on a trip to California with my son, I stayed at the park for some days, and the Wi-Fi  don't work on computers and my son can't play Minecraft with online features or Roblox. They do have a pool, a bathroom, a laundry room that have machines and dryers that cost 25 cents to 5 bucks, and a restaurant that they made nearby that I also  rated on Yelp 5 stars. And I rated this place 4 stars."
4,2,"I will concede the park is clean and well kept.  The ""dog runs"" are little more than a 6'x6' patch of grass...the only grass in the park. It's so urine soaked it's disgusting.  FREE internet is NOT free.  You have to buy an adapter for $30 to use it.  I wouldn't mind renting one and returning it when I leave but I don't need to purchase it and take it with me. Also, we are under the Nellis AFB flight pattern. 6 to 10 times a day we are rattled with sound barrier breaking jets from the base."
4,1,"Really??? Really???????
No one is going to mention the noise from the FIGHTER JETS, right next door at Nellis AF Base?  From about 6:30-7 am thru 5pm, it sounds like the jets are taking off from the roof of your RV.  THEY ARE THAT LOUD!  Believe me, there is Zero possibility of sleep (after having fun the night before in the casinos), past 6:30 am.  
The park is old-about 60 years old, and it looks like it.  Gray, dusty, gravel dirt everywhere.  Pet area very small.
The only upside to visiting the Hitching Post RV Park, was the very nice, young lady in the front office.  Very sweet and helpful!
Keep driving."
4,5,"Stayed here for one night on a stop over on to Zion.  The staff was friendly, the park was clean, excellent WiFi coverage, and the kids loved the pool which was refreshing on a 110 degree day.  The views of the campground are not exciting, but for the price, it was an excellent stay."
4,5,"We stayed here while looking for a townhouse in Vegas but liked it so much we ended up living here for about 5 years! They have a very nice and clean laundry area with plenty of machines, very nice showers and a big salt water pool. They had a putting green and were building a warm water dog bath station when we left. There's also a motel and good restaurant with a fabulous beer garden next door. If Tammy is working the bar, tell her ""Mississippi"" says hi!!"
4,5,This is a wonderful campground if you want to avoid the Las Vegas strip. Close to I-15.  Very clean. Gated and secure. Level sites with cable and WiFi.  Friendly and helpful owners.
4,4,"Staff very nice, bathrooms very spacious and clean, level sites, gated entrance, clean park. On the other hand internet sucks, and Nellis Air Force base is next door from 6:30 am till 10:00 pm Air Force planes taking off and pattern is just above the park, sound like you on the runway, very loud, good pricing for the sites"
4,4,Good place to stay when traveling the I-15.  Typical desert park but they do have a grass dog run....could be larger.  Sites are level and big enough.  The folks working there are VERY nice and helpful.  Camp has a security gate with remote access...a good feature.  Restrooms are clean.
4,5,"great little place with everything you need! Convenient location, great pool, clean amenities! Enjoyed our stay here!"
4,4,"This is a nice park with very informative printed multi-page flyer provided at check-in.  State & Vegas map, TV Channels, park map, hours of amenities and more.  A full page of ""your questions answered"" vs. ""RULES"".  It's concise and nicely put together and gets you a buy one get one free drink at the diner too.  

The park is very quiet, only the white-noice from Las Vegas Blvd nearby.  You don't hear neighboring guests talking, gravel driving/walking or barking dogs.  The restroom was very clean and has multiple stalls for use of potties and showers.  The showers had lockable doors with a staging area for your clothes and such.  Large showers 60"" or some with even tubs (but I admit I wouldn't do that).   

The pool was large touted as 52' saltwater heated & open year round and looked very inviting; I wish we had taken the time to go in.  Clean, well lit and ample of room for multiple guests in the water or along the deck.   

Nice size laundry room although not needed for our stay.  Various amenities including horseshoe, fitness center, nice cable selection including HBO, golf practice area and two small grassy dog areas one complete with a dog washing stations!  Disposal trash is easy with  garbage and recycling dumpsters as you exit the gate.    

The park has multiple security measures in place.  Remote access for gated entry and personal key-cards for access to common areas.  North Vegas is kinda sketchy but the park is very secure.

A small dining room is available that serves dinner until 10pm.  Standard fare nothing fancy but see other reviewers liking the steaks.   My dinner salad side was nicely chopped romain vs. bagged iceberg so points for that.  The bar also serves wings, chicken tenders, wings but is smoky.    

Multiple WiFi networks to choose from, probably as stable as any park.  Sometimes rockin'.... sometimes not... I wouldn't attempt to stream movies but basic searches and emails worked more often than not.  Oh, I might add that a previous reviewer complained about not working with Apple products or the need to buy additional equipment.  Neither of those statements are true.  I would agree if you're bringing a teenager who wants to play online games... perhaps the kid should go outside or to the pool instead.  Their WiFi network isn't designed for such, nor frankly, should it be.  

We ended up leaving a day earlier than planned, we had no issue receiving a refund and the staff was courteous and helpful during our visit.   

The experience was good, I'd recommend staying there if in the area.  Military, AAA and GoodSam discounts provided. Diner offered Military discounts for food."
4,2,"The rv park is so noisy the airport is next to the park 
The strip is far so you need a taxi that cost 25$ each time to get to the strip for one way 
As my first time to Las Vegas I thought to get some help from the front desk but they did know anything even that the primum outlet is close to the rv park 
The wifi not working at all and it's filled lake a parking lot 
There is a food market close to the park that is good"
4,4,"Let's start with the positives- the restrooms are some of the cleanest I've ever seen in a park! Sites for folks staying for a few nights are easy in and out. There are a lot, I mean a lot of people who live there full time. The park itself is quite clean. The little restaurant and bar have decent food, better than having to drive somewhere. Excellent access to major freeways. The negatives, the first one is something that the park has no control over. Starting Monday morning at dawn, Nellis Air Force Base woke up, as in WOKE UP!!!! Holy cow, I thought the jets were going to land at the park. Secondly are the ""dog parks"". What the heck. Dog parks for tiny stuffed animals. We have standard poodles and there were areas enclosed by chain link that were about 10 X 15. Our dogs refused to go potty due to the amount of pee  that had saturated the area. The looks on their faces was priceless. That's OK, we like walking. Overall, we'll stay there again when we need to visit family."
4,4,Great clean place to stay. Bathrooms are super clean. Laundry is clean. Sites are gravel and well kept. Looked like a good place for an extended stay also. U.S. Mail service available. We had great nachos and some catfish in the restaurant/bar. We stayed in a travel trailer. Friendly folks for sure!
4,4,"We stayed here list year (Nov 2011) my dad and I both really liked it.   The WiFi is a bit spotty, do bring a signal amplifier if you have one.  The restrooms are spectacular! I was dying to try out their salt water pool,  but sadly, it was closed.

Its a higher price at about $35Ishtar a night and is north of downtown Las Vegas.  It was really nice and is pet friendly with a tiny dog walk area.  The mini golf is not worth mentioning as it's smaller than the size of a super compact car. 

Totally recommend this park.  You can easily find cheaper if you look but this is one of the nicer resorts we have been to."
4,3,"It was ok. In a dirty part of Vegas. Tried to take a shower while hubby was getting the trailer ready for us to head home, none of the women's showers would turn on!? Jets from base fly over all day, can get very loud when more than 1 fly at a time. If disparate for a stop on your way somewhere it might be ok for a night unless they are doing street work like they did our first night, back up beeping all night! Ask questions before reserving!"
4,1,"HORRIBLE! Do not waste your time. They nickle you to death with extra fees, $15 EACH Person, and EACH Vehicle and EACH Dog these prices are not listed anywhere, and it's noisy as hell. The park has so many long term people that pretty much do what they want, always loud at 10 & 11 pm at night. Clean bathrooms is about it here."
4,2,"Has all amenities, but sort-of scarce shade, all RV's just standing there next to each other. Not really nice to walk around with kids. To get to the office you need to walk all the way out through the gate to the street.
However clean and well maintained.
Also - was twice as expensive as another place we stayed in LV, so I don't see a reason to return here.

Another point - it's right below the crosswind leg for jets taking off from Nellis - so if it happens to be time for takeoff and landing practice (we had that till 8 pm and then from 8 am), every few minutes the RV's are shaking from the sound of the jets taking off."
4,3,"This review is for a motel room: single, non-smoking. Bottom line: the room was very minimal, but clean and adequate. The cost for a Friday night stay was $58 plus fees, $65 total.

The bedroom and bathroom were stark: tile floor, cinderblock walls, no coffee heater. Also, no WiFi, no ice machine. I didn't need to use the air conditioner (which looked new enough to be functional) nor the heater (which looked like it might not work very well). But the bed was firm and comfortable, and the TV had cable channels. Jen at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The North Las Vegas location was close to the I-15 freeway. The best thing about staying here was that it was only a couple of miles from the excellent Galaxy Theaters in the Cannery Casino. Ticket prices for comfy recliner seats were only $8.50-9.00 for seniors, children, and matinee showings."
4,5,"I stayed at this park in November 2017 for about five days. The spaces are close together, but they are really not that bad. The amenities are fantastic. The showers are large, with enough space to get yourself ready in them without feeling cramped in. The laundry facilities were clean and there was a bunch of machines along with several that were large capacity. The dog wash was really great. I had a serious case of dirty dog. The WiFi was great, the staff was helpful and accommodating. I enjoyed my stay. I have read other review that complain about the jet noise, yeah they are loud, but it was so cool to see so many types of aircraft. I would and have recommended this park to others. One thing I learned while I was there is that if you need supplies get on Craig Ranch Road and head west. About 15 minutes from the RV park there is just about everything that you could need or want. There is even a huge park which my dog and I visited many times during our stay."
4,5,"Sandy is my hero!!  So I was in a bad spot! I was on my way home from Utah to Phoenix AZ with my family pulling my travel trailer when it felt like my trailer brakes were locked on.  But they we're not, so I kept on trucking down the I-15 when I started to hear an awful squeal from my engine bay.  My power steering was gone and just a few more miles driving the pump seized up completely shredding my belt.  We thankfully found the Hitchin' Post RV Park only about 8 miles from where we were on the I-15.  We called and Sandy answered and said she could get us a spot no problem.  We pulled in with my truck hardly alive and running at 274*! Sandy assigned our spot and thankfully I was able to start the truck after it cooled down and we had spot 45.  Well I was unable to turn into that spot as my power steering made it too hard and ended up in spot 46 which Sandy took care of and changed us to that spot instead of making us try and go around again.  Hitchin Post allowed me to get a mobile mechanics in and change my pump which normal rule is no working on vehicles which I can understand due to oils etc.  well that repair didn't last! The new pump started to leak bad the next day! So had to stay another night and get another mechanic throw on the pump.  Check out is 11 and we didn't get out till 4:30.  Hitchin post took mercy with us and thankfully only changed a half day for us.  We made it home finally.  This place was great! Very kind and professional employees, especially Sandy! The pool was great! Residents in the park were friendly and I would highly recommend this park if in the Vegas area.  Was located just a few miles drive from the strip.  Thanks for saving us!"
4,5,"We were so lucky to stumble upon this RV park Gem! We drove 8 hours and then decided to not wait in the 6 hour long Camp EDC line. The nice lady at the front desk answered the phone and was so kind when we got there after check in time because of traffic. Full hookups, cable, bathrooms, wifi, and a 24 hour restaurant/bar! Also, after a long day of driving it was great to have a pull through spot and a gated entrance! Definitely would recommend this place if you need a place to camp in this area!"
4,1,The motel was Xtremely dusty the a/c blew dust into the room and i git an eye infection  i wouldn't recommend this place
4,5,"I've had my Dune Sport Dynamite Firestorm DK Toy Hauler/camper for 8 months now and love it.  The camper is 8'x12' and carries everything I need.  Before, I had an 8'x12' tent, a 10'x20' tent and a 24'x24' camouflage canopy.  I am much happier in my Toy Hauler that is the size of my smaller tent.  After my first trip in the Toy Hauler (I've named it ""Klank""), I gave away all my tents, the canopy, sleeping bags and most of my camping gear. 

On every trip, Klank generates a lot of interest and I end up giving tours of my tiny house almost every day I'm camping!  It really seems to be unique and I've praised Dune Sport to everyone who will listen.  The real test was my recent trip to Burning Man.  I was dry camping for 18 days with no source of water, no facilities, no stores.  I had to take everything with me that I needed for the 18 days.  I had changed out the 12 volt battery for two 6 volt golf cart batteries and hooked them up in a series.  I replaced all the light bulbs with LED bulbs to cut down on electrical use.  In the 18 days, the batteries did not require charging.  The propane held out running the refrigerator, water heater and the stove.  The water supply held, with my additional 25 gallons of water.

Every trip with Klank is a learning experience.  I drove the trailer 1,400 miles to and from Palm Springs and Black Rock and it handled beautifully.  
 
I thank you for all the assistance you gave me in purchasing Klank.  I am a satisfied customer..."
4,1,Be careful.  Changing names and addresses trying to hide from old / bad business practices?  FACT: These trailers are cheap for a reason and made by an inexperienced cargo trailer factory... NOT RV professionals.
4,4,"So an update, Overall I still feel they did a great job with the unit and still think there was a communications issue about the LED light under the awning.. but it was just that... communications mix-up. I had mentioned getting small puck LED lights in storage area so I could see at night... The mix up was they were talking about those puck lights for free and not the awning.. so no biggie... I know this is a passionate team... the manager was very concerned about the review.

As I stated before I am overall very happy with the unit... it fits what we need and so far (only 1 trip) no problems. I still strongly believe an option to have the doors to match the color (as close as possible) is something they should look into offering. 

I would go to these guys again without hesitation."
4,5,Today on thanksgiving weekend is my 4 trip with my 16 foot toy hauler. I'm really pleased with the unit that they built for me. I pull it with my explorer. I'm always amazed how much room there is inside. It has everything that I need. I load up my Harley and enjoy both world of camping and riding. Thanks Dune Sport
4,3,"This will be my last update on this company and unit.
At this point we opted to sell the unit and upgrade to something better suited to our needs.
So here we go.

Product: not going to rehash the other items I've gone over, we did however have a water heater failure in 40 degree weather which sucked while trying to shower after a race. Overall it was adequate and that was about it... we owned this product 2 months before we opted to sell it. My complaints remained, noisy bed hoist that was never quite right and made noise all the time... the problem with doors not being able to be opened with sun on it... (not surprised but the managers statement was) The total odd mismatch of doors to the unit, still haven't seen that with any other manufacturer and we looked at them all. The water heater going out 1 month later (again its just the luck) the problem with side bench being so close that I could not sit at the table (I'm 6'2"") The floor was getting a hole where the bench came down from the wall. no pad or plastic on the angle iron to prevent it... 

Staff: I felt like the salesman was knowledgeable about putting the package together... some problems with communication and getting the LED lights on the unit. When I looked over the product prior to delivery I asked about the very rhythmic popping of the bed hoist was normal.. the salesman said yes... I didn't believe it... so I had the manager come out and he stated some noise is normal... which I know... but not every two seconds...that is something binding... I had to tell him to come out... he then listened and said yep its not right... and it needed to be replaced.. 
I'm not worried about that kind of stuff other then every problem we brought up with them we were told it was either nothing they heard of or it can't be... One time my fiancee and I went in I was irritated over the LED light... the manager decided to take it personally and say I was being dishonest on YELP... he kept at it to the point I was ready to jump over his desk... it de-escalated finally... My fiancee was asked by the salesman if we had a fight cause they are the ones that get the brunt of those situations... I was furious.

The finance team is 5 stars... delayed the returned money for the extended warranty by 2 months. That was an a little much... but they have bent over backwards to help.

Overall... I would not return here for a product. My fiancee has owned several types and sizes of coaches... This was my first experience... we needed a larger unit and opted to go with larger 5th wheel unit and we had decided after this experience we would not return for any reason. I have found better service and sales experience with a larger dealer.

I know this experience may or may not be indicative of everyone... we may have just had lots of bad luck. I can't speak to the 5th wheels ... we had the 26ft mancave bumper pull."
4,4,"Overall it was easy to order the unit,  we needed a custom unit for x3 RS and dirt bike that was still manageable in tight off-road areas. 

Hits: willingness to work with us and a time crunch to make thanksgiving at the dunes. It made trying to find the right hauler easy. They added a led light strip for us... awesome manager said for free since it was a mix up...see below in misses.

Misses: the raised bed in the back makes a ton of noise and we were told some noise is normal,  it was consistently banging at a interval. Had to get the manager to listen... he did and turned out the unit had to be replaced, had the manager not come out at my request, I don't know if it would have been caught. We have a dark brown unit with black accents... and every door is white or light grey... I was informed they don't option a color pallette to match.  Told a free led awning light, due to mix up.. but was charged anyway. 

Overall yes good experience, nice trailer but know what you want... make sure you see it added to the order form... double check.. everything before accepting the unit."
4,5,"I was looking for a smaller Toy Hauler for my Harley-Davidson.  I came across Dune Sport last year and after some months of research, I decided to visit them in February.  Casey was very good with my questions and ideas.  That day I placed an order for a 16' with everything along with the kitchen sink!  This May I picked up the Hauler and was very pleased.  However I forgot to order a spare tire hanger, however they did a great job and putting one on before we left to head back to California.  THANK YOU.  Afterwards I had some questions and they were their with support.  I have been out for 3 trips and love the unit.  It pulled good with my explorer.  The unit has everything to live in and it was custom build for me in 16 foot.  My friends are amazed how roomy it is inside.  With the taller ceiling, it feel larger.  The rear door is fantastic with the rubber matting. Thanks Brad and Casey for taking care of me.  Great experience with Dune Sport and having a blast with my new hauler."
3.5,5,These guys are great.   Their RVs and vehicles are clean and top notch.   Their service is outstanding.   I had an issue while out on the trip.   Left a message.   My call was promptly returned and with helpful advice.   Can't recommend them enough.  I would add that these guys didn't try to nickel and dime me on some minor damages that popped up.  They certainly could have but didn't.   Do NOT hesitate to rent from these guys.
3.5,5,I really had a positive experience at Best Time RV service department. Rudy was very professional and helpful and Martin clearly had the experience and knowledge to take care of my issues.  Both gentlemen were friendly and pleasant.  The next time I have a problem I will defiantly bring my Winnebago back here.
3.5,5,"When searching the web for a specific RV I came across the Las Vegas Best Time RV and received an email back with in minutes. Coming from Utah, I wasn't around the corner that I could just stop by and Crystal one of the Sales representatives was able to give me all the information that I needed. She was very professional. We ended up flying down to pick it up and had a wonderful experience. Thanks!!"
3.5,1,"Do not use this company!We rented an rv from Best Time RV in Las Vegas and burst a tyre exiting Yosemite NP. The measure of a company is how they handle incidents when things go wrong and Best Time RV failed on all counts. We were 2 women from Australia,travelling alone. There was no spare tyre on the vehicle. We were stranded in a gas station carpark in an isolated place with no cellphone reception but access to a pay phone for free call numbers only and no incoming available. We were left there for 40 hours despite repeated requests for assistance from Best Time RV and their emergency  service provider Ford. Martin from Best Time RV Las Vegas office showed no concern for our personal safety,wellbeing or distress at any time during this process. Ultimately,after one of our sons got involved and was threatening to organise a tow truck,arrangements were made to tow us out down the mountain at 10pm.We arrived at a tyre shop at midnight and had to stay that night in their carpark. Concerns were also raised by their own service provider Ford  and the manager of the tyre company about the suitability of the tyres for an Rv,but this was not addressed. No compensation was offered for the distress and loss of 2 days rv hire and  2 days of our holiday,only a refund of one night of our pre booked accommodation  which we had to forfeit. In addition we were charged over $600 for the tyre and rim.We recommend you avoid this company as they do not care about their clients,only dollars. We also suggest booking with a company that has a spare tyre on the vehicle."
3.5,5,"Again I had a great experience with the service department. Brian
 was able to find the problem that wouldn't present itself when I tried to demonstrate.  Rudy and Brian both addressed all my questions and explained how to get the best out of my RV.   Would never dream of going to another service center."
3.5,5,I had my Winnebago serviced at Best time Rv by Martin. By far the best service experience i have had at any dealer in the country. Winnebago should thank these guys for restoring my confidence in their product. I know now where to service and buy my next RV. Its worth the trip to their dealership. Trust me.
3.5,5,"Wonderful experience all the way through. Great service, friendly staff, no wait at pick up, 15 min check out, clean and RV from the year. Will definitely use them again."
3.5,1,"Just for the record, I hate writing bad reviews. But people need to know. The sales process was fantastic. It always is though when they're trying to get into your wallet. My gripe is the service after the sale. My brand new travel trailer started having issues within 6 months of purchase. I called in early July to schedule service. I'm just now getting it in tomorrow, 8/22/2018. They are that backed up. I was told they only have 1 mechanic. That obviously explains the 6 week wait, just to be seen. It'll be another 3 weeks minimum before the parts even come in. 9 weeks minimum I'll have to operate this travel trailer with no hot water for showers, dishes, etc. And all the other stuff that needs to be fixed. I only have one piece of advice when deciding on where to buy your travel trailer, rv, etc. Make sure the dealer is equipped to handle the service after the sale! It's completely asinine to have to wait so long to get something important fixed. Minus the hot water issue, the trailer has been awesome. The only other real issue is the cargo doors on each side have warped. The irony is I went with Winnebego in an attempt to avoid this kind of stuff. But like I said earlier, the make is irrelevant if the dealer doesn't doesn't have the ability to take care of you after the sale. For the record, my salesman and the finance guy both quit shortly after I made this purchase. I think at the end of the day, this particular dealership is just riddled with problems."
3.5,1,"I would not rent an RV or otherwise do business with Best Time after my hugely frustrating experience. Bottom line: the day we returned the vehicle, they made us wait an hour before starting to write up our final invoice (we were told to allow 30 minutes for drop off). After 1 hour and 20 minutes, we were told they would either keep our $1000 deposit, or we'd have to pay $880 for an awning they claimed we damaged. They were unfriendly, accusatory and caused us to miss our flight home (first time in my life I've missed a flight--and now my first ever Yelp review). At best they are careless and unprofessional; at worst they are scammers.

The details:
In picking up our RV, the staff were very friendly and breezy. I was asked to examine the exterior of the vehicle and note any damage I saw, as is common with rental cars; I noted a few minor scuffs and scratches. 
I was then given a quick and cursory overview of the RV and its many systems. One of these is the motorized awning on the side of the vehicle, to create shade when parked. The employee used a button to extend and retract the awning, and I was told to be sure not to drive the vehicle with the awning extended (yes, good idea). We were headed to cold climates so I asked how to keep warm at night; she pointed to a thermostat on one wall and said 'it's just like the thermostat in a house' (which we learned later was not true at all). In a cupboard I was shown an 'owner's manual' and told I was good to go. I signed the rental agreement and we arrayed our belongings inside.

My wife asked if I saw the coffee maker and folding table and chairs we had added to our rental; they were not on board. I asked about them, and they were then brought out to our vehicle. In hindsight I now realize had we left without them, I feel sure Best Time would have claimed we lost or stole the items and charged us for them.

On our first cold night, my wife and I both tried to work the thermostat. I was impossible to figure out, one lever was fixed in an OFF position, the other moved but did nothing. I consulted the owner's manual: no instructions on the thermostat. I called the ""24 hour help"" number and was told by someone in an overseas call center ""I can't help you with that, I can only help if you have had a collision"". I pleaded with her to put me in contact with someone in the US who could help. About 30 minutes later I got a call from someone who explained how to work the thermostat and said ""They are really difficult to use, I know."" There were multiple other examples where we discovered the overview we were given was inadequate, the owner's manual thin and incredibly incomplete, and we were left to puzzle how to get various systems to work.

When we returned the RV, no one was friendly or breezy, it was all serious. After the unit had finally been checked by their staff, I was asked to return to the RV. Two frowning men met me and said I had damaged the retractable awning; they then extended it and showed me 4 tiny 1/2"" linear slits that were perfectly equally spaced. With the awning extended, if you looked up you could see 4 tiny slits of sunlight. I replied that we only used the awning once on the whole trip and we did not damage it. They said that I must have hit it on something and I replied that we did not. They then said that since I did not note that there was any damage to the awning before I left, then it means that I caused the damage after I left. I explained that I was never asked to examine the awning, and their reply was their ""estimate"" for $880 to replace the awning.

I spoke to the manager Neil who said ""It did not leave here looking like that."" I asked how he would know, if he or anyone had examined it when we picked up the RV and he replied ""No, I can't do that, I have 5 locations to manage."" It's so egregious and predatory it feels like a scam they run on the unsuspecting. Never again."
3.5,1,After coming to a good price they told me they would charge me 960.00 for a stabilizing hitch and they would charge me for battery never heard of that  so I walk out called back and they said they would put the hitch that I bought for 267.00 on when I picked up the trailer I could put it on but the sales manager said they would put it on. When we arrived the manager said the owner said unless they sold it to us they could not put it on. He said I received such a low price no Battery.no battery for a trailer with a power lift. They  promise you everything then you pick up your trailer and the lies start. I was going to buy the Warranty from them after that no way
3.5,5,"Hi everyone,

we just made great experience with the BestTime RV company (San Francisco branch office):
- we booked & prepaid the C-class RV ""Minnie Winnie E-23"" approx. 3 months in advanced via their German reseller (FTI alias Drive-USA dot de)
- on the spot we received exactly that number, model 2018 in the excellent state
- the hand-over was a pleasant experience, because everything was shown to us and explained in slow pace without any rush/ time pressure
- during our journey we didn't have any issues so I cannot comment on the support services quality
- the return was similarly easy-going as the initial handover and in a friendly atmosphere, no tricks
- as a bonus we've been taken to the BART station, free of charge

This significantly contributed to our positive holiday experience. Good job BestTimeRV team at SF!

Jan, Central European"
4.5,5,"This was SO much fun!!! I did the ride with a guide. Lee/Leigh(sp?) picked me up at Caesar's. I was a bit early but so was she so she let me hop in early. We went on our way to pick up other people who were riding at the same time as me, but not with me. In short, they were an absolute nightmare but everyone on the staff was extremely professional and seemed completely unbothered with the exception of when we exchanged secret looks of frustration. During the ride I rode with both Casey and Dustin. I had to switch a few times due to issues with the motley crew but they both made sure I had a great time and I really appreciated it. I highly recommend this team if you want to do something different and fun! Would love to do this again."
4.5,5,"Went to LV for a weekend trip. Unexpected adventure. We looked for a tour that would give us the longest trip for our money. Being motorcyclists we love that adrenalin rush. This tour did it all.  Pickup was easy. Guides and sweep were great. At one point I lagged behind and  the sweep quickly picked up the lead and brought us back to the group. Actually got the buggy to scale sideways on part of a bowl. Thrilling. Terrain was varied with sand dunes, river beds and dropoffs. Can't wait to do it again."
4.5,4,"This was very fun, would definitely recommend this adventure! Make sure you wear clothes you don't care about because you will get dirty! They have many options, riding solo, double, 3 people or with a instructor! And half way through they provide water! Which was nice because it was super hot! And also beware it will cost you money if you roll one over!"
4.5,4,"price point perfect. kenny was the best guide. he went above and beyond!.please tip these men work hard to give you a great ride. reservation online so easy. pick up and drop off included in price.  the shuttle ross work hard to keep everyone on schedule.  there and back in las vegas is hard. four hours go fast, realkt fast! thanks guys 

tip: this is not a girly buggy ride. it is hot funky, dirty, hot, bumpy, rough. 
do not expect to he pampered! i sent my men and enjoyed 5 hours by the pool by myself. 
they got dirty, sandy, rough and had fun!
please tip, tip, tip! las vegas is about tipping. my tip sunny buggy is worth it!"
4.5,5,My family had such a great time on the Razor adventure. My two teenage girls just loved it. Paul was a wonderful guide. He made our tour adventurous but we felt safe the entire time. Thanks for a great day.
4.5,5,"We had a blast here today and will definitely do it again. Jeremy was our guide and was great! I highly recommend trying this if you could me to Vegas, their equipment is very nice and maintained well"
4.5,5,It was such an amazing time!  From the ease of scheduling last minute with Brittany  to our wonderful  complimentary round trip shuttle service a short trip from the Vegas Strip with Casey  (he is hilarious and very accommodating) to Dustin our guide. Dustin was very knowledgeable  and extremely helpful with regard to the basics and operation of the vehicle and driver and passenger saftey. Laid everything out in basic English and took us on various terrains with his knowledge of trails out in the dessert. Took photos and had bottled water for us..swapped drivers halfway and it was exhilarating to say the least.
4.5,4,"I had a blast with this.  It was a lot of fun and the tour guides were great.  The ATVs were in top shape and handled the rough terrain great.  The guides kept a great pace for the group going.  They would hit it hard/fast in the fun sections of the course and if anyone fell behind they would slow down to let hem catch up. 

In the orientation they really try to stress that if you break it - you buy it, but really, you have to be an idiot to roll one of these.  

My only complaint was the shuttle from the hotel to event - they crammed us into a van that was completely full and it was about 30 mins late from the scheduled time.  I removed one star for this."
4.5,1,"I am pretty upset!!!!!! Yesterday was our 2 year anniversary and I had booked a UTV tour in July in order to secure our date. I wanted to do something really special for my husband given it was my year to plan. He lived in Vegas for 2 yrs so I really wanted to do something that was new and exciting for him. After I secured my date, I received a confirmation email stating that they would pick us up at 8:30am at the Cosmopolitan near the valet parking area on September 14th. 

I specifically emailed them prior to ensure they would pick us up. After 40 mins past our pick-up time I knew something was not right.

I received a call relieved thinking maybe we were in the wrong spot. Only to  find out the lady on the phone was thinking I was requesting a new tour on the same day. After I told her we had confirmation of the tour, she arguably insisted that we did not, then followed with you are right. She had mentioned that they could pick us up at 10.30am. What pissed me off more was her crappy attitude while she raised her voice at me. I was livid!! This was our day, and we had no time to get picked up later as we wanted to make it back home in time for work the next day. I was unhappy with their professionalism and there inability to be prepared on the date in which they had confirmed!!!!!!!

I had to pass and cancel. The whole day was not ruined as we were able to hit the pool we were staying at as we were not going to let this ruin our day!!!!

I AM SUPER UPSET and recommend that you dont book any tours with this company."
4.5,5,"So much fun!!!! 

There's so much more in Vegas than gambling and nightclubs!!!!   We decided to play on the Las Vegas san dunes with these awesome 4-wheel machines 

Their machines do everything an ATV or simple dune buggy does.... but much more.  Twice the horsepower, 4 Wheel Drive and long travel suspension make their RZR's able to navigate through terrain and scenic landscapes unseen by any 2 wheel drive buggy.  Their fleet is all long travel S model Polaris RZR's... very user friendly and lots of fun!

LOCATION: out in the dessert.... maybe a 30 minute drive from downtown Las Vegas. Directions on their website make it easy to find.

SAFETY: they provide you with a helmet, face sock and of course a safety briefing and house rules. This place is kid friendly too.... as long as you are old enough to drive, you're old enough to play. 

PRICE: worth the price, we were out in the dessert for quite some time. If choose to go on a private tour instead of with a group, it costs a little more, however, you go faster with your guide. 

SERVICE: the guides are super friendly. They take you to a nice photo spot with 360 views so you can get your photos in. There's a guide in front and one in back so no one gets left behind. (Side note: we tipped $$ the lead guide and the last guide they made our experience worthwhile)

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: we had a blast! We could only go as fast as the last person.... if you get a private tour.... you can go faster!!! Its a pretty sturdy machine and u have to really be reckless to flip those things over....I highly recommend you don't flip those things over or you'll end up breaking  your wallet paying for one of those things.  

Definitely coming back for the private tour!!!!!"
4.5,5,Best bang for your buck! Literally everything about this company is worth it! I booked an evening trip as a surprise for my boyfriend and we opted for the ride with guide and I would recommend this option Bc for one the guides know the limits and make your ride that much more fun! Rich was our guide and he was great! Very humble and informative! If you are looking to do anything recreational while in Las Vegas this is the place to go!
4.5,5,"If you want to try something fun in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Razor Adventures is the place to go. We went on a 2 hour razor tour. From desert hills to sand dunes, this is the coolest thing to do. Our guide Dustin was very knowledgeable and always made sure our group was safe. 
Everything is provided to you.. We had a blast!"
4.5,5,My company schedule a trip to Las Vegas and my time on the ATVs was the BEST part of the trip.  The staff were friendly & incredibly patient.  I'd absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for some fun outside of the casinos.
4.5,5,My friend and I had a great time. Razor adventures is the best above the rest. Mark was a great leader.  Very knowledgeable of the course and took good care of us.
4.5,5,I had my bachelor party here and it was amazing. I called up Rosie from razor to come pickup 8 people of our group at the last minute and she came through with flying colors. She greeted us at our hotel on the strip with open arms and made us feel welcomed. After her very exciting safety tutorial she then drove is to the site where the utv's where located and the two guides there where absolutely friendly and fun to ride with. Justin was one of them and the other guy I forget his name though they made us feel comfortable riding these utv's in the desert. Thank you for a great time!! I will be back when I visit from philly again.
4.5,2,"Sorry only a 2 . Got to tell you that Amber was a great guide but she can't control the general maintenance of the OLD beat up Razors.  
My buddy and I were the only rigs to follow Amber into the desert. In about 45 minutes my friend burnt the used belt. Stop the ride ,go back to the start and get a newer one. He said the newer one was 120% better than the crappy one they gave him from the start. 
Me, I lasted until the trip was almost over. 30 minutes before we were through my rig started to ""puke"" every time I gave it gas. We limped back to the starting area. The day was over. Fun time Vs break down time. You pay for it all. 
Got to say for the $$$ I expected more. 

HINT: When you get to the starting landing all of your rigs will be on line for you. There will also be RESERVE rigs off to the side. Theses are newer rigs there to replace the old ones when they break down. If you are given a ""crappy"" beater ask for a newer one. Trust me, you will enjoy the day a lot more in a reliable 4 wheeler Vs the beat up ones. 

Nothing will ruin you day like having to stop, and then limp back to the landing because THEY CAN NOT DO COMPLETE AND UP TO DATE MAINTENANCE ON THE OLD RIGS.   
That's to bad to. You are ""on the clock"" from the start. All that break down time counts on your time, you paid for it."
4.5,5,"My husband and I took this tour on our first day in Vegas and had a blast. The groups were small so it allowed us to do a lot of exploring without worrying about people getting left behind. Paul, our guide really knew the trails, quickly gaged the group's comfort level and we were off riding through the different terrain! Definitely got an unexpected souvenier when I got back and was still finding sand! Highly recommend, definitely check it out!"
4.5,5,Excellent day out in the desert. The staff was first rate and the guides were excellent. Landen and jake made for a great afternoon. One of our crew lost their lunch but everyone else had an amazing time.
4.5,5,"Had an absolutely amazing time with these guys! They were fun, entertaining and showed us a great time! They were also affordable. Thanks for a great time today. Special shout out to Casey and Jeff!"
4.5,5,"Second time with LVRA on a work off-site. Great time with these guys. Devin, Jeff and Casey were great and made sure we had a great time. I'd highly recommend them for a good time."
4.5,5,Great time with Casey leading us!   Megan took care of us back at the shop!  Highly recommend as a group event!
4.5,5,"THE BEST experience - great price for plenty of drive time. They picked us up from the hotel on time and we stayed on schedule throughout! Just enough explanation on safety etc. I went with my husband as well as my brother and his fiancé - our guide, Mike was AMAZING. The guys left feeling like they had plenty of adventure! Mike knew I wanted to drive at least a little bit but also knew I wasn't wild about some of the faster/steeper driving - he made time for me to do a nice drive and then we kicked it into gear again when my husband got back behind the wheel. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. We absolutely recommend RaZor adventures and if you're lucky enough to have Mike as your guide then you're in for a great (and safe) day! Mike, if you're reading this then we THANK YOU again!"
4.5,4,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

The Group: 5 guys on a bachelor party

The Good: The staff is very nice and accommodating, the guys that take you out on the razors absolutely want you to have a good time.  You tell them what you want and what you like they WILL do their best.  They really know the terrain and will make this fun.  Just follow them and don't be an idiot
Equipment is in good shape and has everything you need, even has an enclosed overhead compartment to throw your stuff.
The driver that picked us up, sorry cant remember his name, (reminds me of morgan freeman) is awesome.  Nice, told us what to do, how things were going to work and answered 50 questions from all the ding dongs in our group.  Great Guy!! 
I go to the desert 5 times a year, you coming and only have fun, dont have to deal with the trailer, the gas, the maintenance etc, and if you think you are in the market for a razor you need to do this.  The guys know all about Razors, we talked maintenance, capabilities, etc., better education than the dealerships who will tell you anything in order to sell you one.

The Bad: Lots of driving from orientation, explaining could have been better and  the first half of the razor driving way too slow for our group.  I understand they need us to be safe (unless you are an idiot, if you follow them and do what they say this is an absolutely safe event- like I said these guys are good.)  We are all desert rats, all ride dirt bikes, sand rails, razors, atv's, etc.  After we stopped for water, we communicated and it got better.  Unless you are absolutely extreme you will have fun.

The Ugly:  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars.  This is Vegas and we had two guys not show up.  We told them that we might have a couple of guys not come because this wasn't their thing.  We were given lots of grief and these were not family members but was told we had to pay.  They didnt end up making us pay but 20 minutes of back and forth soured the experience a little

I will be back!  My kids and my wife are gonna love this."
4.5,5,"The tour guide was hilarious A+. I really liked how professional this company was. Even though the sport is ""very dangerous"" I felt really safe having a tour guide, and especially because the equipment was professional. I would 100% do this again, I had a blast!!! It's all about the 4x4's!!! We got a four seater, but next time I'm getting a two seater!! It was Halloween weekend when we went, and the office was decorated really cute! They even had candy and water/coffee- I know these things don't matter, but it's the details that count!! Even the staff was dressed up!!"
4.5,5,"My family and I had a great time Sunday. K.C picked us up early, was very knowledgeable and fun to talk too. He is a good driver. Lol. The 2 females in the office I didn't get their names but they were very helpful in getting my girls with helmets and googles. Dustin was a great guide and was very straight forward on the rules. There is 2 other gents out on the field that I didn't get their names, but you know who you are.
I would recommend taking the family to try this out, we will probably not. One back since I now will be getting one soon, but will stop by and say hi sometime. 
Keep up the great work all and it was so much fun. 
Thank you

4.5,4,"Picked up promptly for our 8:30am reservation. Unfortunately unable to be picked up at the Venetian but it's a short walk over to Treasure Island. The passenger van takes you about 20 mins away from the strip. Our driver was entertaining so there's no awkward silence for the ride there and back. Quick signing of waivers, paying, helmet fitting, and you're off. We opted for a 2-seater and 4-seater, two hour ride, for our group of 5. Our guides were great. Made sure everyone kept up and was able to assist if anything went wrong. i.e. getting stuck in sand. Beware of all the sand/dust that will get on you during the ride. I'd suggest a t-shirt because the seat belt was rubbing my neck while wearing a tank top. Ladies, remember to take off any earrings and pull the face mask over your nose to block any sand. Push the pedal to the medal and ride!"
4.5,5,"This was the definite highlight of my trip to Vegas this week.  I didn't know what to expect, and was a little nervous based on some of the previous Yelp ratings.  All I can say now is that I had a really great experience and didn't have the hiccups that some others complained about.  Communications with Rosie at booking and before the day we went out were very clear.  Pick up at our hotel was ten minutes early, not a problem since we were already waiting for them.  One couple at another hotel waited at the wrong place, but the driver, Gary, was very accommodating with them.  Gary is a fountain of old and new Vegas knowledge and a really good guy.  At the Las Vegas Razor Adventures office, Rosie again was very clear and left no doubt as the rules and reasons.  The real fun started when we were dropped off at the starting point in the desert.  Our guide, Connor, was outstanding!  He's a cool low key guy, was very good at communicating how to operate the Razors, and what to do and expect on the trail.  The Razor we had was in good working order and continued to amaze me with how much punishment it can take and just keep on going.  Ok, now to the good part.  This drive was awesome!  Connor took us over terrain that I never would have attempted if not following him.  Up dunes, up hills then back down trails so steep you would have thought you were on Ice Road Truckers.  Rocks, gullies, the course ran the gamut.  Every second was an adrenaline shot that didn't stop until the two hours were up.  You couldn't pry the grin off my face for hours!  Summing up, the Razor driving was incredible, and Las Vegas Adventures put it together in a fun and no muss, no fuss package.  Thanks guys!"
4.5,5,"So fun!  Recommend this for any age. 
Very well organized, punctual pick up at hotel lobby,
Very well taken care of by staff.
The actual tour is a blast. We rode in a New Can Am, all the Equipment is in excellent condition. Great variation of terrain and lots of hills,rocks, sand dunes.
So glad we got out to do something different in LV!
Thank you  Las Vegas RaZor!"
4.5,5,"Lots of fun in the desert. Pick up st my hotel was right on time. Driver and office both called to make sure I was not missed. Setup and paperwork was quick and easy, we were out and driving in no time. Lee, Brandon and Jake were great at providing a great experience and making sure everything from the experience to the trip back to the hotel was great.

Very friendly across the board, great people at a fun experience.  I would definitely  recommend this to anyone 16+.

If you have a Go Pro, bring it. You can attach it to the front of the machine and have the memories."
3,1,"Shady Maintenance Practices!!!!  Caveat Emptor!!!!

I have over 20 years of mechanical experience.  I usually don't take anything in for service unless it is beyond my experience or capabilities due to not having the unique tools to do the job.

I was in a pinch right before a hunting trip when my generator wouldn't start.  I figured well it's probably a clogged fuel filter from old fuel and not being able to draw fuel manually to the carburetor in-line. (A couple of months before the generator ran fine).  Since I was in a pinch I decided to pay to have the oil and filter changed before the trip and that should fix it. 

I received an update call during the day, ""bad news, your fuel pump is also bad.""  I was skeptical, and said let me call you back.  I immediately thought I was being taken for a ride, after considering the time I didn't have and that maybe I was just being a little too paranoid and the the fuel pump could be bad, I called them back and authorized the repair.  

I received another update ""bad news your carburetor is also bad"" I asked how do you know for certain?  ""I got it running, but won't stay running, old fuel can cause a lot of things to go bad.""  I knew this could be true, but since I was already up to $300 in parts and labor figured I would need to do the rest myself, or pay an additional $500+ more, so I told them I would pick it up.

I found a better deal on a new carburetor and installed it myself, and to my surprise that did not fix anything!  I tinkered with it for several more hours and could not get it running.  I called Sun City RV back and told them that the carburetor did not fix the issue, they said ""well, you can bring it back in and we can look at it.""  Yeah right!  I decided to go with someone else.  The new mechanic was stumped at first, and couldn't figure out what was wrong, said ""might need to replace the generator"".  Said he would check a few other things out first though. ""Bingo -  Found the problem, there were a couple of wires that were disconnected""  These were not wires that could simply pop off.  They were intentionally disconnected!  He connected the wires and the generator ran like  a champ.

These guys are greedy scammers, they are not content with the ridiculous prices they charge you for honest work!"
3,1,"Don't waste your time.   The salesman couldn't even be bothered to show us anything.   ""They're all unlocked,"" was the most coherent response we got. They have almost no selection, which I guess is equal to their level of customer service. Skip this place."
3,1,"So we live in seattle and found what we thought was the perfect RV.  My husband and I talked to a couple different sales people almost daily over the course of close to three weeks.  We asked all kinds of questions, we asked for a list of everything that might be wrong so we could make a decision if it was worth it to buy one way tickets to fly there and drive it home.  They got back to us with only a couple minor things that we thought not a big deal.  My first red flag was when they wanted our credit card for a deposit and they they said but we won't charge it.   A couple days later we got a call they wanted to charge it what the heck, they had flat out lied about not wanting to charge it.  Then a couple other little things, like neither one of the sales people the couple days before my husband was going to fly there wouldn't call me back? Why? Who knows.   The day. And for my husband and son in law to fly there (keep in mind we bought the tickets 5 days earlier at 300 a price for one way), my husband called me 15 minutes after getting to the dealership to tell me we were out!!! Turns out they flat out lied to us in things we asked.  The motorhome was leaking water in while they washed it  and had leaked in the past, the roof was all bubbled from leaking (can't have a leaker in seattle ), the inside was smelly and the wallpaper was leaking in the bathroom. There was mold, a new toilet that were going to pay for had not been installed even thought the day before they told us it had been   And the list goes on...... so needless to say my husband and son in law bought same day one way tickets home.  Sun City RV could have at least been honest with us about everything.   Not only are we out about $ 1400 in plane tickets but time off from work.  Did they think that because  we flew all the way there we would just bow down and take a pos motorhome?   We would not recommend this place to our worst enemy!!! They won't be honest with you!!!"
3,1,"I traded my truck and 5th wheel for a 2007 Alfa motorhome 9/5/2014 and after papers signed everything went downhill.  But, that is another story.  They owe me $525 from overpayment on my trade.  I have talked to them 7 times and get they same thing ..Its in the mil. or will be mailed.  2 weeks ago the manager Don assured me it was written out and going in the mail.  I have talked to them twice since then and still nothing.  It is frustrating working with people like this
Other problems that are mine now.
very poor walk through.  nearly wrecked motorhome because was not told about air brake. thought it was automatic like my trade.
Water fill does not work.
tv not working properly
they tried to defraud the insurance company about  refrigerator.
I thought that they might be an ok dealer because of their BBB rating now I have to report to the BBB.

3,1,"I can only review Consignment process!  Brought in  a travel trailer for consignment, in excellent condition.  The rep showed me NADA rating and said MSRP was only about $6000 and they offered me $4500!  I asked for $5000 based on the information provided!  They said they could probably only sell it for $6500!!!  Three days later I see my trailer listed on their site for $10,700!  They did nothing to earn that much of a profit in my trailer, trailer was in excellent condition!!  Questionable business practices!  I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BUSINESS!  Beware and do your homework!  Unfortunately I did not!  They do not disclose the actual sale price so the possibility was that the business earned as much as I did on MY trailer for little effort!  I highly recommend asking what you think it's worth and be willing to walk away!"
3,2,I won't go to Sun city rv again. What a disaster. Don't know what's going on there but they have had a lot of turnover with employees. They couldn't find my paperwork for about 15 mins. either. Don't trust them.
3,5,"Five plus stars for Sun City RV!  Great experience!  We bought a used travel trailer and from the start to finish everyone we worked with was so nice and professional, it was great.  Derrick, Jim and Don were all great to work with and Don spent so much time with us giving us (newbies to the RV world) great advice and trailering tips to help us have great and safe travels.  Mark and everyone in the service department were top notch at making sure everything on the trailer was in good working order.  Thank you Sun City RV!"
3,5,"The customer service I received at Sun City RV was some of the best I've received in all my years of full time RV travels!
While travelling thru Arizona the Suburban water heater on my RV malfunctioned and would not ignite. Spending the majority of my time ""boon docking"" off the grid, this was a serious problem. Based on my location, the Suburban customer service department referred me to Sun City RV as a factory authorized service center.
I telephoned Sun City RV and was informed the service department was completely booked and not accepting appointments for at least two weeks. After explaining my predicament to ""Bob"", the service department's scheduler, he told me to drop by and they would at least take a look at the problem for me.
Upon arrival I dealt with Bob, ""Hugh"" the technician, ""Jim"" the parts procurement specialist and ""Darrell"" the warranty specialist. Despite a series of obstacles, the four of them were able to resolve my problem and get me back operational in less than two hours and with minimal expense.
In conclusion, I would highly recommend Sun City RV for your RV service needs. Without a doubt, this crew was a class act willing to go the extra mile for me. It would have been just as easy for them to have given me the ""so sorry"" line and sent me on my way. Instead they made a loyal and satisfied customer!"
3,5,"We live in Oregon and found our ATC trailer on Sun City RV's website. It was just the one we were looking for and decided to contact them. Jim Grant was our sales person and he worked with us on pricing and the paperwork process to purchase our toy hauler. We drove the 20 hrs to AZ to pick up the trailer. We felt we had everything we needed to pull the trailer home; however once the paperwork was complete and we needed to hook up our sway bar we found that our brackets did not fit on the trailer. Jim and Don Roberts worked with their service dept manager Derek to find a solution to our situation. They found brackets that would  fit and Steve in the service department stayed a bit longer to help install it on our trailer. Also knowing we had a long trip ahead of us they filled the trailer with some water and filled our propane tanks. Our plan was to stay overnight in a RV park and found one right next door. Once signed in and parked in our spot we found the park only had 30 amp service and we didn't have the adapter for our 50 amp plug. It was 6:00 pm and Sun City was closed. I called Don on the number on his card, he answered and said come on over, I'll raid the service department and grab you one. What a life saver, he stayed a bit longer to wait for me to come back to purchase that adapter. We greatly appreciate all the support they gave and how they made us fill at home (like part of the family). Thank you Jim, Don, Derek, Steve and the rest of the Sun City staff. The purchase of our first toy hauler was a great experience.

3,5,"WE did a stupid thing. We drove our 14 foot tall RV under a 12 foot bridge taking ""shortcut"" in Denver tearing off our our two ACs. We call Sun City RV in Phoenix to get it fixed and the drove there as fast as we could. We had checked around and other shops  were going to take weeks. Sun City had everything working perfectly in 3 days getting us on the road to our destination. They kept us in the loop the entire time. We are totally satisfied."
3,1,"This place can only be in business because of the easy victim clientele known as snow birds who have to be extremely gullible to frequent this place. 
While on a recent vacation trip we developed a problem with the electric tongue jack on our trailer. While we were still some miles from our destination in Phoenix I sent this place an email to check on the availability of a new electric jack for our trailer.

I sent the person who responded the first time, Tracy White, a note stating that I didn't think they read their messages for understanding since they did not respond to my question about the part I wanted to buy. Instead the same person sent the second note twice and still had no clue about what I was looking for. This is the worst customer service response I have seen in a long time and these folks have to be the worst at listening and doing what you want. I would not trust them with my RV if they can't even answer a simple question. I got great service and the part I needed from a smaller company in Kingman, Arizona before I ever got to Phoenix."
3,5,I've had to opportunity to take my RV to them 4 or 5 times in the past few months and I'm very happy to say all my experiences with them have been positive.   Tracy is always friendly with a smile on her face and always very helpful.  Mark and Dave are great people who have helped this newbie out quite a bit.   I thank you all for such a wonderful experience.   I'd like to say I'd see you again but....LOL   Thank you for all the jobs well done.
3,5,"I was a little nervous after reading the other Yelper's comments, but we purchased a tent trailer on consignment and I have no complaints.  They set it up as soon as I expressed interested and verified everything worked.  We worked with Ed and he was very helpful and did a great job.  Only one area of improvement would be to speed up the paperwork process, but even that wasn't a big deal."
3,5,"I stored my RV here for for months this winter. I received wonderful assistance in advance and with a little problem I had. Great safe and clean place to store my RV and nice to know I could get service, or as I did...have the outside cleaned!  Would like to use this service again, thank you Katherine!"
3,5,Recently I called to inquire about a space to park our trailer.  I would have to. say Catherine is one of the best at customer service that I have experienced in a long time.   Even though we were not able to use her storage faculty due to our restrictions she was STILL amazing to work with.  I would highly recommend giving Catherine a call for all your storage needs.
3,5,"Danny knows his diesels, fast honest service and good pricing, we take our fleet here.."
4,5,"Emailed asking if they had a specific generator transfer switch electronics and they responded within hours with not only the exact part I needed but pictures to confirm it.  For sure not your every day pick a part lot specializing in RV's. You can email them, call them, or stop by and look in their cage for electronics, browse the huge tent for common items (and quite a few not so common items) or wander their lot and pull the parts you need from their revolving stock of RV's.  They are great and work with you.  I found the same part on Amazon for less and they beat the price.  Couldn't be happier.  I'll always try this place first."
5,5,"These guys are awesome. A very friendly husband and wife locals operation. The jet ski I rented was very fast and very safe. They hooked the trailer to my car and I was on the water in less than an hour. I dropped it back off and they unhooked it. 5 stars is not enough for this company. Great prices, friendly staff and very conveniently located on the way to the lake.  Keep up the great work. :) I will be back soon."
3,1,"We had a terrible experience to pick up our RV. I called in the morning and my appointment was confirmed at 1.00. Upon arrival at pick up center, i was told that i will need to wait for one hour. I ended up waiting for 4h30 without any excuse or explanation. One employee told me that pick up was guaranteed between 1h to 4h, so that I only waited for 1h which should be acceptable. After such a long wait, I finally got my RV with a fuel tank totally empty, with kitchen not installed because they had no time to install it, with no picnic table as it was not available. So my advice if you have another alternative, please do not rent from Cruise America in Las Vegas. Awful experience. AVOID"
3,5,I have worked with Danny at desert diesel on both of my trucks now he is very good and knows trucks inside and out I drive almost and hour to bring him my trucks I recommend this place for sure
3,5,"I've used Danny a few times to work on my 2005 Dodge Cummins.  The truck has 236k miles and it was overdue for a set of new injectors and a new high pressure pump.  Danny asked what my use and goals for the truck were, made suggestions on what I should replace and part suggestions. He worked on the truck for a few days to make sure it was perfect.  When I went to pick it up he looked me in the eye and told me, ""if anything goes wrong or your not 100% happy please let me know.""  I had his cell and he always answered.  Going back next week for a Hp Tuners tune to finish out the build. Fantastic Diesel mechanic with fair prices.  I will be back for all my trucks needs...."
3,5,"You guys really saved us by providing an extremely thorough and honest inspection of a vehicle that we were looking to purchase! We would have otherwise been extremely blindsided and completely taken! Thank you guys for being knowledgeable, honest, and awesome!"
3,5,"I had Danny install exhaust, EFI Live tunes, Edge CTS2, EGT Probe, lift pump, fuel rail mod, remove failing EGR and DPF on my 2010 Sierra. What a difference! Took a couple of days in the shop and some trust as they are a bit disorganized. I am very happy with the results. I've had no issues and this truck is a complete animal now. I have a towing vane brake now and it works exactly as expected. I tow 18000 lbs all over the country and I need nothing more. 
Danny is honest and sticks to his quote. I was happy to find that I could call him when I had a question on the road about my EGT temps and he was happy to give me good information. I wouldn't hesitate to give him a call and you should check his google reviews as week to see his customer service there as well. 
Update 7-2018: 60000+ miles later, we've had zero issues with the LMM. We had the common passenger side up pipe crack at 175,000 miles, and replaced them with PPE pipes and we're back in action. I'd recommend if you're planning to hit your emissions, get the up pipes done at the same time to avoid the pain. Lower EGTs and more consistent turbo pull has been my experience. I can hold a gear much longer now. Danny is the man to beat in the Phoenix area."

3,1,"Desert Diesel is a very incompetent diesel mechanic shop full of uneducated people that don't know how to repair vehicles without damaging them took my truck and ruined it and still charge me $20,000
Daniel is the worst mechanic in the world doesn't know how to do anything right and lies to you about it don't trust this shop"
3,1,"They diagnosed our non starting vehicle as fuel issues and the cost depending on what repair would be anywhere from $3k for fuel pump to 10k with all injectors repaired. We decided to get a 2nd opinion. Turns out it was electrical related not fuel. Glad we had our vehicle towed to another shop for a 2nd opinion. Another issue was when our truck was towed to this shop I called to check to see when they would be able to look at it and was told our truck was not there, it took 3 hours for them to finally say your truck is here after calls back and forth from the tow truck driver to the owner of shop. The problem is the owner was not at the shop and they do not have an office to talk to someone. When you can the shop it is the owners cell phone and the voice message is full so you have to keep calling until he answers the phone. Very unprofessional and unorganized shop."
3,1,Me and both of my brothers have all had bad experiences here. Convenient location for the west valley but not impressed.
3,1,"I recently purchased a 2003 Fleetwood motorhome with a Cummins ISB diesel motor.  On our first trip, the check engine light came on so I Googled ""Diesel Repair Near Me"" and just around the corner from the Sun Cities RV Compound (where I store my RV) I see Desert Diesel Repair with a 4.9 star average with 91 reviews.  OK, this is the place for me (I place a lot of trust in Google reviews).  I set up an appointment to bring it in.  Dan came out to take a quick look and noticed a little bubbling of coolant coming from the plastic reservoir and pointed this out to me.  I left it with him for the rest of the day.  He called me to let me know he was done so I went in for the diagnosis.  I was told it needed a new turbocharger and EGR system with the estimate running from $6500 to $7500.  Really!!!!?  ""Oh yeah"", Dan says.  ""The turbo part costs $4000 alone"".  (I looked the cost up online - more like $500!).  I thought I would bite the bullet and pay since we had an extended 3 month trip coming up.  I was going to schedule but before he would start the job, ol' Dan wanted $5000 up front.  Before he would even start the job!!!  I never felt more like a mark (sucker) in my life.  I never did receive any diagnostic codes.  I don't think it was ever done.  And I still had to pay $110 for this ""diagnosis"".  I ended up calling an old friend in Washington state who is one of the best diesel mechanics around there.  He said to replace the plastic reservoir that was leaking, refill it with coolant and see what happens.  I did that and sure enough, no more check engine light.  And it cost me a total of $88.00 plus the coolant I already had.  Sure beats $6500 - $7500!  Since the Sun Cities RV Compound is just around the corner and there are THOUSANDS of RV's there, I hope I can save a few of you fellow RV'ers from being taken advantage of by Desert Diesel Repair."
5,5,"I'm extremely happy with the quality of repair at Greg's. My 2004 Toyota Sienna AWD was having disturbing issues with the steering - it was a high pitch squealing sound when I turned the wheel. I also had issues with the check engine and VSC light being constantly lit on my dash. I've brought this car to the Toyota dealer and they didn't have a solution for it, Greg was able to fix this issue! The customer service and communication was good. Barbie let me know what was going on after the diagnostic and what needed to be repaired. The final repair ended up being higher than quoted originally but I understand that mechanical automobile issues can take more labor than anticipated. Most importantly, the issue I brought my car in for was fixed. I am happy that they provide a 2-year / 24,000 mile warranty with the parts they install as well! Would recommend Greg's to anyone!"
5,5,"Our ""go to"" auto and motorhome repair center!
Brakes began failing on our tow vehicle while we were in Florida,
but we don't trust anyone else to do our repairs...so as soon as we returned, we called Greg!
He took care of the issues, professionally, reasonably, and immediately!"
5,5,"Once again, in need of repair on the motor home!  Turned out the computer said there were lots of things that needed repair.  Since we were off for a long journey, we had him do everything that the computer said we needed.  It was a lot of parts but he was so fair and reasonable on the labor charge!
We recommended him to a neighbor, who took his truck to him.

Glad we found him!"
5,4,"I have to say at Gregs customer service is great. I first requested for a quote on Yelp, and the business owner responded promptly. The communication was done in a very professional way, both online and over the phone.

In the shop, the receptionist as well as the mechanic I met with were both very friendly and helpful. Despite that at checkout the receptionist falsely swiped $1100 from my card (which did not go through) the first time but quickly corrected it, I am very satisfied with how I was treated in the business.

I had my vehicle's air conditioning system inspected and recharged. The mechanic evacuated the system, recharged refrigerant and mixed refrigerant with oil. The cost for the service is not competitive compared with quotes I received elsewhere, but I am okay with it.

The main reason for my dissatisfaction is probably the overconfidence of the mechanic about his experience and judgement. I have air blowing out from the passenger-side vents being warmer than that from the driver-side vents. The mechanic's diagnosis is ""stuck or broke mixer door"" and recommended labor is ""remove and replace mixer door and motor"".

The truth is, the air conditioning on my vehicle operates on a reheat principle, not a blend principle like on many other cars. Air is first cooled through the evaporator, and is then heated again in a heater matrix. Temperature is adjusted by directing different amount of hot engine coolant into the heater matrix. On many other cars, though, cooled and hot air are blended through the blend flap/mixer door. Temperature is adjusted by mixing them with different ratio. These are two distinct types of air conditioning systems, and mine does NOT have that mixer door at all.

I tried to explain this to the mechanic, but politely but firmly insisted that he was right. He stated the dash must come out and the mixer door and motor replaced. I have removed the dash and gained access to the heater assembly before, and I can confirm there are six motors:  fresh/recirculated, windscreen vent, face level vent, foot well vent, ""ram air"" and rear temperature blend (NOT passenger side). There is not the blend motor he thought was there.

Finally he said there was nothing he could do if I did not believe in him. I left because I certainly did not want him to waste time on finding a door and a motor which simply do not exist.

Again, the mechanic was courteous and warmhearted, but I would appreciate it if he respond to my insights in a more humble manner. I do not doubt that he is way more knowledgeable and experienced in vehicles in general than I am, but when it comes down to my particular car, what he believes may not always be true.

Myself: Engineer, former mechanic apprentice, owns official workshop manual of my car, worked 200+ hours on my car"
5,5,"Greg was fantastic to work with. Our sliding door motor needed replaced. He Was straightforward about repairs, didn't overcharge, and worked carefully to ensure no additional damage was done (window replacement with our door repair). He's worked on my husband's work vehicles as well. Highly recommend him."
5,5,"I can't say enough about the great service I received at Greg's.  I called on a Friday morning to see how much tie rods would be.  Not only did they beat Midas by almost $400 they were able to get me in Friday afternoon.  Bonus...my final bill was actually cheaper than they told me.  
As I waited they actually took me back to show me what they were doing to my car and why. 
My boyfriend has also had excellent service from Greg's as well. 
I 100% recommend this place for service.  I love supporting local business and this one certainly has my business."
5,5,"Honest, friendly service - can't ask for more than that.

We had such a pleasant experience with Greg and his crew, which says a lot for them since our car began having issues just a couple hours into a 13 hour road trip. We managed to coast into their parking lot, they ran a diagnostics test while our crazy dog ran around the shop with Greg's two dogs. At first the test came back clear, the only thing it looked like we needed was maybe some fuel injection cleaner, which Greg told us we could do on our own and to grab some from a gas station or auto parts store. Then, when he went to send us on our way, our car wouldn't start. Greg immediately ran a test on the alternator and found our problem. He was quickly on the phone calling auto parts stores to find us the least expensive alternator. He let us know the price up front and quickly repaired it as we waited. We really could not have hoped for a better experience. Many thanks to Greg and his team."
5,5,This repair shop is great to work with. I called to get my exhaust system repaired and it was completed very quickly the same day for a very reasonable price. They are very honest and trustworthy. I will always take my vehicle to them to get serviced while I live in the Champaign area. Extremely satisfied.
5,5,"Greg from Greg's Truck and Auto did a great job with my repair. I knew my car needed brakes but I was unsure to what extent the repairs would be. I called Greg and he had me stop by to get his opinion. When I got there, he informed me about the preliminary, visual condition of my brakes and what he and his team would do upon getting the car in the shop. 

I made an appointment with Greg, and when I dropped the car off, he informed me how long he would need the car and that he'd call me before any parts were bought or work was done. When he called, he told me what was needed and how much it would be, and obtained my authorization prior to completion of the work. 

Greg's prices are very reasonable and the work is top notch. My car brakes smoothly and quietly now. Greg could have easily tried to up sell me on front rotors and brakes, but instead assured me that the fronts were fine, and replaced only the rears. I highly recommend Greg's for anyone looking for an honest, quality auto repair shop. Thanks Greg!"
5,5,"Really nice, clean place. Service was great and fast. Give me the information I needed by phone first, and did not change after the job was done. Answer all my questions. I was there because My car air conditioner needed cold air."
5,5,"We discovered Greg a few months ago when our usual repair company could not fit our motorhome in his bay!   Now, we use Greg for all our vehicles.  He has been honest and reasonable, and done the repairs we have needed in a reasonable amount of time!
We are thankful to find a place we can take all of our vehicles for repairs  (and we have several!)"
3.5,1,Would not recommend this Park. We have two older dauchhounds  and chose the deluxe site. It was very nice and we were happy with it until we got a call from the office letting us know that our dogs were not allowed to potty on the rock yard on our site and they MUST go to the dog park. When I asked about the other dogs that pottied on the trees and rocks on their way to the dog park I was told I should call and report them. Will never stay at this park again as the regulars watch and report (tattle) on the offenders of a dogs nature.
3.5,1,"My partner and I travel the country by RV.  (rubbertramps) so trust me when I say that I know rv places. So as far as security for the grounds is great! If that's what you're looking for stay here because I promise you'll want that since this rv resort is in the worst part in vegas. Price was high here compared to another rv resort across the street.  $700 monthly here as compared to $350 monthly resort across the street.  
The whole rv Park is nothing but concrete.  So it does tend to stay hot around the day.  The dog park is all gravel. My dogs didn't quite like it being raised on grass.  I understand there's a drought going on but if the RV Park is going to water down the rocks might as well put grass down and water that everyday. Again though the staff is super friendly unless you talk to the office lady... In the end this rv Park gets rated a one star for their poor customer service"
3.5,1,"The office staff is horrible and unwilling to compromise in any way with long term residents.
We where told that people in our situation that have been here for years don't get prorated.
So if they treat people that have been here for years that way no wonder they treat people who have been here for 4 months the way we where.
       The campground is off nellis and in the ghetto, bad side of town. The 4 months we where here we heard cops/ambulance most every night and gun shots on a weekly basis. Homeless sleep just outside of the front gates and the park is backed on 2 sides by subsidized housing. 
         The ""dog run"" as the park calls it on their website is a sorry excuse. One is the size of a parking spot with no fence the other smells of dog poop more offten than not.
          You get charged for eveything, key to restroom, laundry and pool 10$, parking pass 10$.
         The park has no grass. Our spot was just as if we parked at walmart. Even the premium spots have no grass.  Most of the park is just one big parking lot.
          Security drives around and bugs the shit out of you on a daily basis bc their list of rules are long and very detailed.
Stay elsewhere while in vegas. This park is over rated and costly."
3.5,5,"Great people, great place! I've been to Vegas many times, but never traveling in an RV. My BF and I stopped there for one night on our way to Utah. The staff and the residents (I met a very nice man from the mid-west at the pool) we're all extremely fun to talk with and the lady who ""parked"" us gave us some great suggestions on the easiest way to get to our show that night. The park was super clean, easy to find, and close enough to the strip. I would definitely return."
3.5,5,"Older park, but well kept. The park staff are some of the friendliest folk I've ever met.  We stayed a week, parked a 38' 5th wheel, have a large dog (boxer). The dog run is small, but seperated in to two sections. People and dogs were friendly. There is a huge dog park 1.5 miles from park (at the end of Flamingo Road - past Sam's Town). The park has top notch security at the front gate and very often patrolling the park. Made me feel very secure. Although not many activities, they had started up Bingo when we were there. A lot of long term residents/campers and most others kept to themselves. Laundry small, but very clean. Advice - wash after noon. Seems most campers that are leaving wash the morning of their departure. I highly recommend this park and we will definitely return if we have our RV next time we visit LV. Note: There are lots of activities to do if you want a break from gambling - hiking at Red Rock Canyon, attending dinner mystery at Fitzgeralds on Fremont Stree.  Good luck!"
3.5,1,"When We arrived at Las Vegas RV Resort, our first impression was that it was a super nice resort. The spaces  up front had paved pads, gravel, a shade tree and a palm tree. We decided to stay 3 days because it looked so nice. In addition, there was a security gate manned 24/7. To our surprise they escorted us to the very back of the lot facing the stored rigs, the street and pads were all asphalt and one very tall Palm tree. We should have immediately refused the site and ask for something else but we were so tired we went ahead and unhooked our tow vehicle and hooked up. We have a small dog and the only place that dogs could go to the bathroom was in 2 dog areas. I had to carry my dog to the potty area because of the blacktop being dirty and hot. Well, the day we checked out we discovered one of our 2 bikes, hooked on back of our motor home, had been stolen. Security said someone probably came over the fence and stole it.  The bike was brand new and very expensive. The whole experience was devastating!  We Do not recommend this place. Could not wait to get out of Las Vegas!!"
3.5,5,"Wonderful RV park! Perfectly laid out, very easy in and out of spots with help from considerate staff. Super clean and organized showers and laundry.
So quiet and safe a feature we really appreciate!
A good spot for pets to use as a potty with two areas for several at a time.
Only one suggestion would be a place where they could really run and play ball. Perhaps a shaded sim lawn area.
But, that being said, this resort is a WINNER!"
3.5,5,Nothing fancy but a great place to stay when in Vegas. Nice area for pets. Staff is friendly. I feel safe when staying here.
3.5,4,"Nice people and amenities. We only stayed 2 nights. It's a big place so if you have dogs request that you get close to the dog park otherwise you will be driving there. No trees around our area not sure there are any in park now that I think of it and there are some long term small mobile homes there. Clean pool, hot tub, showers, bathrooms and laundry room. Reasonable price. We would stay there again. Oh and there's 24 hr security, a plus considering the area."
3.5,3,"I stayed here back in August of this year.  The people that work this RV resort are friendly and the grounds are both clean and organized.  

I did not care for the location of Las Vegas outside the gates of this resort but the good folks running this resort seemed to be on top of their game in keeping unauthorized people off the premises.

That said, I would come back here."
3.5,4,"Very clean and organized park. The staff were all great and we felt very secure leaving our bikes on our motorhome in this gated, well monitored community. Equally easy access to downtown and the strip-about 5 miles to both. We'll stay here again!"
3.5,5,"We are generally ""boondockers, so it's rare that we sidle up to water, power, and sewer hookup places like this. 

However, some friends of ours who travel in high style were staying here for a couple months (to escape the winter cold of Boise) and we decided to stop in for a few nights to share RV tales (and adult beverages).

This RV park is set up really well, with just about everything you could want when you want full hookup facilities. There's laundry and showers, a pool and spa, a workout room with more than a treadmill, a dog run, easy access to trash dumps, and a gated main entrance with a guard. There's 24 hour patrols to keep you safe. 

That last part is important because the neighborhood is a bit on the seedy side. Jogging around the neighborhood would not be something I would recommend. 

There's lots of shopping fairly close, for groceries, booze (Lee's Liquors is not far and it's Toys R Us for adults!), and fuel all within easy short driving distance. However, keep your doors locked at all times, and hang on for dear life because Las Vegas drivers are just plain crazy! 

There's a Walmart nearby, and that needs NO special description. I'm sure you understand, especially in THIS area. Ahem. 

The RV park is like your 'safe house' in an area you most likely would otherwise avoid. We really enjoyed our stay. The employees are all helpful and friendly. You are escorted to your site once you check in and assisted in getting situated. They offer as much or as little help as you need. 

We usually bypass Las Vegas. We were going from boondocking in Quartzsite, AZ to boondocking in Death Valley, but made this detour to visit with our friends. 

We would stay here again if our high styling friends were here."
3.5,3,"It's a good place.  It's clean, safe and quiet.  It's just not in the best part of town.  I witnessed no less than THREE crimes during the month I was there.  One was on the local news, and I could watch it in real time as I saw it across the block.  The other two were arrests at two of the nearest Walmarts.  Crazy!"
3.5,5,"This is a small clean rv resort. Reasonably priced, quiet and the staff is first rate."
3.5,5,"I'm going to make this quick. Good Sam gives this 10/10/10 and it lives up to all those scores. What differentiates this resort from others is the security. Controlled access in, guards, and well lit. Another unique characteristic is the sites located at the entrance prior to the security entrance. These are nothing more than minimal parking spaces with full hookups for those just passing thru for a night. This keeps people from coming in at all hours and leaving early. Great idea."
3.5,4,"Staff was very friendly and greeted us by name when we arrived.  Quiet resort, not a lot of occupants.  There is a security gate, which is nice to have in that neighborhood.  It is very close to Walmart and Sam's Town.  Each spot had a palm tree, picnic table, and flowers."
3.5,4,"Recently stayed one night. Very clean and well maintained facility with friendly, helpful staff. Restrooms and clubhouse  excellent. The deluxe sites are large and comfortable. The standard sites are up front before security and much more spartan. They have off season online specials now which includes deluxe sites so pick that level. The only thing I'd like them to add would be some sort of drop off at Sams so you don't have to walk at night if you dont have a toad. But will come back next trip to LV."
3.5,1,"I had a terrible experience with this park today. I just bought a beautiful travel trailer and I needed a place to live for 1-6 months. I chose this place for security reasons. The facilities were clean and the grounds were well kept, but the customer service threw me for a loop.

Before arriving, I told the staff I had a 2009 travel trailer painted blue, and they took my money for a nightly reservation to start. When I brought my trailer in to set up, they disapproved and said it had to have a ""factory paint job."" The trailer is beautiful and was professionally painted, and it's in perfect condition.

So I hauled this thing to their lot after hours of fully disclosed discussion prior, only to be turned away when I arrived. I'd never heard of such a rule? 

I was very upset, as I needed a place to park ASAP. I got a refund and took my business elsewhere to a nicer, more affordable park with friendlier staff. I recommend Arizona Charlie's!"
3.5,5,"This place is awesome! The staff are friendly from the time you  arrive until the time that you leave. It's very secure and very pet friendly. They have a very nice swimming pool, exercise facilities and very nice laundry houses. if you're coming to Vegas and you need somewhere to put your RV, this is the place you should be."
3.5,4,"Basically the park is good but if you want any kind of internet service the park is terrible. This has been a recurring theme every time we have visited this park over the past 7 years. I just checked the internet speed as I cannot get on again and it is 1.19MB download speed and 0.18MB upload speed. I just checked again and the download is 0.21MB and the internet has crashed so there is no response to even trying an upload. This is worse than dial-up internet from the old days.

The park is really doing themselves a disservice being with Tengo Internet all these years. We simply cannot stay very long each trip as the internet is a huge problem for us."
3.5,5,"My husband and I stayed for one night in our 22' Rialta, while driving through LV on our way to Colorado. Though we didn't need a very large site, when we checked in, we asked for a site near the pool, so I could go for a swim. Dan, John and the gal (sorry, we forgot her name) who greeted us warmly when we arrived at about 9:30 in the evening, were very helpful. They offered us the closest site (Deluxe) to the pool and restrooms, which worked great for us. I went for a long swim this morning. The pool was immaculate and the area very quiet.  I got in a great swim! 
We didn't have any pets so cannot comment on the pet areas. Though the shower water temp got hot and cold on its own, it really wasn't a problem. We were advised to make sure our bicycles were locked up on our vehicle because apparently they had experienced some problems before, so we put on an extra lock, but no problems. 

We'll definitely stay here again when coming this way on our RV. Thank you!"
3.5,5,"Probably shouldn't right this review, only because this place fills up fast. The dog park is great my puppies love it, nice Quiet place, the staff is always great. Very safe secure property even though the Nieghbor hood isn't.
I love this place."
3.5,1,"Our family was very excited for our summer RV trip to Las Vegas. When we arrived at Las Vegas RV Resort however, we were very disappointed. 

We were told we could not stay there because we had children with us and children were not allowed at their site. I didn't recall seeing any information about children not being allowed when I booked it (but I could have missed that ""minor"" detail). To add insult to injury, I kindly asked to be refunded for our reservation since we couldn't stay there and they refused (very rudely). I was flabbergasted! Not only would they not allow us to stay, they were extremely rude and would not refund us the money we paid for our reservation!  What happened to good old fashioned honesty?!  Pay for services you use, and don't be fraudulently charged for something you are not even using!

So not only did we have to scramble to try and find another place to stay (with an RV and 2 children) last minute, we were also at a loss of 2 nights reservation fees we paid. Needless to say we were very disappointed.

Fortunately we found another RV park not too far away, Arizona Charlie Boulder which welcomed us warmly. Actually their grounds were much better kept, with a nicer pool and definitely much nicer staff.  If you're looking for an RV Resort in Las Vegas (with children or not) I highly recommend Arizona Charlie Boulder. You will not be disappointed."
3.5,4,"We have stayed at this park a number of times.  The staff are nice and friendly.  They have a huge new Dog Park with four separate fenced areas.  One is really long and good for big dogs.  There is also a leashed area.  Site are a fair size but there is no grass in the park everything is asphalt.  Laundry is good, there are two.  Clean. The whole Park is quite clean. Security comes around regularly..   better than Sams town KOA and many others."
3.5,5,"We stayed here on our way headed to Montana. This place is awesome! Everything is so together and clean. They do not allow children, so if you have them with you, find another place. They have a lot of sites, the next best thing would be to have an adult section with a pool and a family section with a pool. More shade would be great too, however we have found the lack of, is typical of many campgrounds.Very friendly staff, safe, and pet section was fine. We will be staying here on our way home again. Totally recommend..."
3.5,1,"The security was good. The Tengointernet didn't work. Since the prices of this RV park were double those in the nearby area, I was very disappointed. I think they should get rid of Tengointernet since, ""No Tengo Internet"" at this campground. My reference number for my complaint was 253063. The representative was nice, but he couldn't say when if ever Internet would be restored."
3.5,1,"Very sad, that many negatives on how you don't approve or treat monthly folks. Always take in consideration where you are located in a high danger area. Treat paying folks with goodness."
3.5,5,"Great RV Resort.  Very  good security, friendly service, Very clean, lovely pool and jacuzzi.  Nice lounge to relax and socialize, watch television and have morning coffee. 
Enjoyed our stay very much."
3.5,5,"This park is fabulous. It's clean, well lit and the jacuzzi is hot. The Internet speeds are lousy, but that seems to more or less be the norm with RV parks. I especially appreciate the 24 hour security patrol in the park and at the entrance. There are lots of beautiful palm trees and everyone I've met in the past month has been friendly."
3.5,5,"We stayed at LV RV Resort for 2 weeks and enjoyed it tremendously. Next year we want to come back for 2 months. Park is clean, security is very good, staff people are friendly, pool is clean and inviting, bathrooms/shower rooms are exceptionally clean and pleasant to use, parking spots are spacious. And the rate was $29! LV RV Resort is only a 17-minute drive from The Strip, but it was a pleasant quiet park - a great location for us."
3.5,5,"I have been at Las Vegas RV Resort for a year now..Very nice park compared to any of the other places I've stayed. I like the 24/7 patrol and feel very secure in the park, despite being in a not so good neighborhood. The dog areas are gravel but we are in the desert, grass really can't be expected here. I help maintain the dog areas where we use a disinfectant 1-2 times a week and a deodorizer 4-5 times a week, followed by raking , water and clean EVERY night. Also It Is Highly Recommended FOR Our Four Legged Friends That You Bring A Wagon OR Haul Dogs Over To The Dog Run Areas IN Your Vehicle Due To the very high Temperatures we experience in Las Vegas And if your dog wants grass there is a dog park within 2 miles of the park. The pool is very nice, small gym, laundry area, and lounge in the clubhouse. The internet which has had its ups and down is now running really smooth. Also there is no children allowed, which keeps this place very quiet."
3.5,4,"Partner and I always enjoy our stay here. Third time was a charm. Even the cheaper sites in the back are well spaced, although they aesthetically leave a lot to be desired. However, they do offer many sites with rock gardens and pull throughs. Staff is very friendly. Facilities are kept clean.  One of the cheapest RV parks to do laundry at. Nice pool and jacuzzi. A couple of dog parks. Overall, the park has a great desert-Las Vegas ambiance. Conveniently located to Sam's Town, Strip not a bad car drive or bus ride. 24-hour security at the front entrance and around the park at night."
3.5,4,"Die Umgebung ist nicht gerade perfekt. Aber die Angestellten vor Ort sind sehr nett und die online Reservierung hat super geklappt. 
Wir waren nur eine Nacht dort. Alles gut und sicher :)"
3.5,4,"Things just didn't start well here.  Pulled in with our C-RV attached to our 37' Class A  just before sunset midweek.  Typically I unhook the car while my wife registers.  Unfortunately there's just enough of a slope that it made unhooking difficult.  I was pretty much so told that was where I had to unhook (which made sense later).  A very nice guy (who turned out to be our neighbor) patiently waited before escorting us to our site.  He politely stood by while my wife navigated me into our standard back in site.  She knows precisely how I like to have the coach positioned.  Part of his job was to make sure that I was only in my site.  That's a great policy.  All hook-ups at our site are behind the coach in a shared gravel area.  Our 50 amp outlet is located so low to the ground that the portable circuit breaker thing I use is essentially lying on the ground.  Not good.  I use one of those blue disposable water filters attached to a gauge pressure regulator for the water.  The faucet is about 9 inches above the ground pointing down at a 45* angle.  It required the short little hose attachment that they often is included with the filters, an item I had neglected to bring this trip.  Good thing we had plenty of water in our fresh water tank!  Then there was the dump hose issue.  It's a long run (about 20' for our coach) to an elevated connection on the far side an asphalt curb.  These hoses "". . . should be raised off the ground . . ."" at this park.  Never ran into that before.  Our dump orifice is located so very close to the utility box that I had to cut off the lever on our attachment designed to facilitate an easy solid connection or dumping would have been impossible.  But . . . The site is pretty wide.  Plenty of room to park the car in front of the rig.  It's hardly more than an asphalt parking lot, but that also makes leveling easy.  All the employees have been just great.  We look for a quiet, safe park and it most definite has been that.  (I would not suggest venturing outside the park on foot, however.). We try to stay at the nicest facility in the area.  This is probably number 2.  For our desired purpose in visiting the area - visiting family, not casinos - not to mention the discounted special we took advantage of, this will be our #1 choice."
3.5,3,"Staff were very friendly. We stayed here in a 37' MH for 3 months and while someone did tidy up the pet area daily, I never once saw a ""disinfecting"" of any kind. My dachshund was very ill and required vet care.  The noise from the road (sirens, traffic; gun shots and police helicopters were regular events) was disturbing to say the least. The traffic getting out of the park onto Nellis could be a nightmare as well. Once you are inside it is safe enough - I wouldn't recommend the pet areas so if you are in need a place in Vegas without pets. This could be your spot. Laundry and bathrooms were clean, we did not use the other facilities."
3.5,5,"All star RV Park.  Very clean, quiet, 24 hour patrolled park.  Pool and hot tub were awesome.  Community area, laundry room, showers and bathrooms were very nice and clean.  WIfi spotty but whos isnt?

The only thing I would suggest is a meet and greet day or something for the residence to meet and chat, hang out, cocktails, Horderves/Appetizers.

Our stay was about 40 days. Highly recommended."
3.5,4,"My wife and I stayed here for five days and were very pleased. Very clean and well maintained, security at the gate, and well priced. Will stay here again if we are in town. The only drawback is the noise, especially at night from nonstop sirens and helicopters (but that is not the park's fault)."
3.5,5,"Really enjoyed my stay at Las Vegas RV Resort! Very fair price for a nice, spacious, level site. The staff were friendly and the facilities were clean and up-to-date. WiFi worked well. The park was about a 10-15 minute drive from the strip. It was surprisingly quiet to be this close to the strip. Loved the 24 hour security. Would definitely stay here again!"
3.5,5,The park was very clean and the staff was very nice.  We will be staying there in the future and recommending it to our friends.
3.5,3,"All in all, this is a nice secure park. Some older trailer type RVs, but no riffraff.  24 hour  security, and a great pool and spa. As for Wifi, their Tengonet is a joke! I am forced to write this yelp on my iphone on 4g.  The office closes at 4:00 pm  SHARP.  Not 4:01, making it difficult for a working couple to receive mail. More asphalt than landscape, but they do have several well maintained dog run areas. Lined on two sides by low rent apartment buildings, which can get a little loud late at night. No on site convenience store which means you must leave the resort for any necessities. FYI, I would not feel comfortable walking out of the resort at night. Overall, I would give them a four rating with the exception of the Internet issue, and their office hours."
3.5,2,"Absolutely avoid this place looks r deceiving with a string of thefts lately by the letter the office put out here.
Not only that in the same letter the explain it's a courtesy patrol NOT A SECURITY FORCE N THE LETTER READS THE COURTESY PATROL CAN DO NOTHING!!
Also the dog run which is small stinks to the high heavens my shoes stunk dogs feet also.
The gate had been hit one of the two gates wouldn't close.
Residents congregate in the dog run talking several of them at a time.
Drain your unit or walk in the door at the laundry room n it smells like your near a sewage treatment plant.
Stayed there two n a half months while checking in I wrote on the check-in ""Lab n Stafford Shire terrier mix the counter help tells me no problem if there's a problem Sandy the manager will let you know, ok?
Paid the third month $575. A month just to park + electric n out of the blue this person calls n tells us without warning to get out now didn't come out to look or talk just get out now!!
I ask will I get the 3 Weeks refund that is around $400. N the answer is ABSOLUTELY NOT!!
I don't know if this Sandy even exists or they have a ghost on there payroll!
But this is the beginning of my review.........."
3.5,1,We were very disappointed with the accommodations for dog park- it was bare ground that smelled very strongly of urine- my dogs were not happy to go in it and my male dog got sick afterward with diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days .  The security staff were very friendly but the staff at the checking were not helpful at all-
3.5,5,"The whole week here was awesome, all the employees were very friendly. The park was easy to get in and out of. The pool and clubhouse were awesome. There is a fenced in area for dogs which is really nice since ours hates to be leashed. The only negative I have to comment on is that there are no quarter machines anywhere and everything there seems to take quarters such as the laundry and the ice machine. Otherwise the bathrooms/showers were really nice and clean, we'd stay here again if were back in Vegas."
3.5,4,"I am giving them a four star rating due to having privacy, space  and rate of 29.00 nightly ( off season ). The facilities are very clean and the entrance secured. The only issue I have with this park is that they have a small enclosed area for pets to potty in the middle of the campground and an area at the front. They state that they do not want pets urinating anywhere else in the campground other than these pet areas.  Really?? 
If you plan on staying here and have a pet, especially an older one, pick a spot close to the pet area!"
3.5,4,"The park was nice, clean, and everyone was friendly. They have a live guard at the gate all night long, and we felt very safe there. It was very quiet at night. I didn't even realize anyone was around us. 

The only reason I didn't give it the extra star, is that although this RV park is not far off the strip, with traffic lights, it takes a good half an hour, and a $40 cab ride."
3.5,5,This is a very nice park it's a ways from the strip and all the rif raff . It's pretty quiet at nite . We used the hot tub and pool each morning and  they were very clean . Bathrooms were spotless and the staff were so nice and helpful . The guard shack was monitored 24/7 just as advertised and it made the stay more secure in the evenings when coming home late each nite we were engaged by the guard before passing thru .  There are some permanent residents here  but park is largely mobile . They have long sites and were very accommodating for towed vehicles .   It's not that far from Us 93/95 . We would  certainly recommend this park and on our return we will b coming back .
3.5,1,"This ""resort"" is far from it.  Rude and unhelpful lady at office desk.  She not only has no phone etiquette, but is far worse in person.  I will not ever give another dollar to an establishment with such terrible customer service and will recommend my traveling friends to do the same!  Sure it's reasonably priced but not worth the rude staff."
3.5,5,"This RV park was easy to get to from the interstate.  Upon arrival the friendly staff greeted us and led us to check in.  We were escorted to our site.  We chose a deluxe site and found it to be spacious. Our site had a picnic table and full hook up.  The restrooms near the pool were really clean.  The pool was a welcome retreat from the blazing heat.
Getting anywhere was easy with Uber.
The RV resort was quiet.  We would definitely go back there again if in Las Vegas( just have to chose a cooler time of year)"
3.5,4,"Not a whole lot of great RV park options in Las Vegas. However we enjoyed our stay at Las Vegas RV Resort.

We stayed here for 5 days. When we first got there and checked in they put us in a very small spot for our 26' travel trailer. They have someone who guides you to your site and helps you park it. Took a bit of back and worth just to get it to fit without hitting anything.

However ultimately I decided that spot was just too small for our setup so I went to the office and told them and the nice lady quickly moved us to another much larger and nicer spot right across from the small one. This one had plenty of space for our RV and truck. It was right across from the pool and laundry and had plenty of space for chairs BBQ etc.

They also have 3 large dog runs where you can let your dogs off leash which is always nice. Although they were usually full of dogs as it's a huge park. 

The pool was nice and clean (although again usually full of people) and although we only went once we really enjoyed it. I do wish the hottub was not as hot as it was especially when it's 100 degrees outside. 

Wifi was hit or miss. Overall it was a nice park and we would stay again."
3.5,5,"We stayed at Las Vegas RV Resort for 3 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stayed. Of course there are casinos, but plenty of authentic ethnic cuisines here, as well as great massage to soften aching muscles after long cross country trip, and great dog groomers were what drawn us to Vegas. This RV park is a lot safer than other establishments in north part of town; nothing vandalized or stolen according to SpotCrime app within 3mi radius from this campground. This RV park has majority of back-ins sites with full hookup for $32/night. Our site (and many other sites here) barely fits big RVs with slide outs or awnings, but we perfectly contented with ours and have plenty of room  to maneuver... yep, size mater! Short walk to beautifully furnished and clean 6-stall bathroom. Most stalls were occupied in early morning, but vacant after 3pm. Three separate dog runs plus many sheltered dog patches for our pooch in the park. WiFi is great with free TengoInternet, LTE is great. Campground is pretty quiet after 10pm. We would stay if pass through this way again."
3.5,4,"It is hard to rate this park in that it was 107 degrees and other than stepping outside to hook up and take photos after sundown... we did not use any facilities. This is a great park for traveling through. Easy to find, and great Freeway access... both North and South. Reservation was confirmed by email. Check in was flawless and the park is spotless. We reserved a pull through, full hook up 50 Amp site and it was barely.... just barely... long enough for us to stay without un hooking the TOAD. For me to get the rig and toad on site... I had to forgo hooking up the sewer... but we were only there for the night so it was not an issue. I would definitely recommend this park, but make sure, if you are going to be there multiple days... that you question the ability to get your rig and toad on site... with hook ups. We camped at Las Vegas RV Resort in a Motorhome."
3.5,3,"Length of stay, 6 nights. 
I'm writing this with mixed emotions because the park is clean, restrooms are immaculate, pool is very nice and the staff is friendly.  However, do not let them put you in sites 330 or 332.   The reason is that site 331 has numerous boxes, tubs trashy outdoor decorations, empty flower pots, an unusable power chair, and a mattress at the front of the 5th.  The mattress was removed but the other items look trashy.  Management told me they have been ""working"" with the lady for two weeks and plastic tubs are ok for long term but not if you are a traveler, mixed rules. It doesn't appear that working with her is doing any good. Site 332 is a deluxe site that you pay extra for but is degraded by lot 331.  As I said I have no problem with the park, just my neighbor and it seems the management efforts are going unheeded.  Photos of lot 331 attached."
2.5,1,"I called Gary at funtime RV as I was looking at a RV on craigslist. I've  shopped RV's for a while and the price seemed to be in the area if the others I looked at. I liked the diesel propane type engine so I called Gary. We made a deal over the phone and Gary assured me fly in drive out. 
Well $300 early flight and guess what? The RV looked terrible filthy dirty and I sent a copy of my plane ticket! They knew I was coming. Then the windshield was cracked from top to bottom!  Then the batteries were dead and wouldn't even jump with a jumper. I asked you knew I was coming, the unit is filthy (see the pic windshield and dirt). 
The said they would put a battery in it but the windshield was my problem. Now this is the driver's side windshield that's  a safety issue! God know I'm sure it had a lot more pop problems. Now another $300 to fly home because Funtime RV doesn't bother to disclose any truths about the condition see pics of an RV I was to buy after flying to Funtime RV.
Needless to say don't even call them it's  a mostly old junk RV's dealership. And Gary instead of appreciating and respecting the deal he made and that $600 round trip told someone to take me back to the airport. Rude and horrible experience. It takes a lot for me to Yelp so if you read this and still do business with them...you're crazy!"
2.5,5,"Gary really took care of us! 

I purchased a 1994 37' Fleetwood Pace Arrow there this past July 2016. I was told the truth, left alone to thoroughly go over the RV, for as long as I wanted to. 
No hassle no BS and we negotiated a price rather easily. I was treated like a valued customer. 

The lot and office are minimalist and not a like a new car lot type experience. 

But for a camper, RV or trailer. Check them out and you will find a good deal and a friendly honest person in Gary."
2.5,1,"We went to this place to buy a used trailer that was put online as being in good condition. When we got it home, there were way too many places where the ceiling inside was rotted, the floor had soft spots where we stepped through the floor, also the kitchen counter  is all rotted in the corner from water damage . I know we probably should have checked it out more but we trusted him. We did see when we bought it that it needed wallpaper and linoleum. There was no problem with that. But all the underlying water damage is horrific. I even called the owner of Funtime RV  and told him about all the rot . He tried to tell me he did not know anything about it. What a liar he is. That is his job to know about it . It is his reputation on the line . It is funny that he did not hesitate  to go from 4995 down to $3,500 for the trailer  when he says he did not know anything about it . He should have gone down a heck of a lot more for all the work we have to put in it . The sad part is we are people that do not have a lot of money and we had to borrow the money to buy this trailer. Please do not buy a used trailer from them unless you want to have to put a lot of work into it.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."
2.5,5,"My family has done business with Gary and Pat several times. Although they are a bit quirky, they're definitely fair and all around good guys.

We were more than happy with our experiences with them and have recommended several close friends as well as multiple acquaintances to them for R.V.'s. 

These guys were great even after the purchases and if the need ever arises, we'll be back!"
2.5,1,"This place is a graveyard for RV's. Go somewhere else. They lie about everything in regards to  the RV, I went for a test drive and there was still sewage left in the RV-super discusting!!"
2.5,1,"I found the exact rv I was looking for at a great price  from fun time rv on Craigslist. I spoke to Gary on the phone several times to make sure the 25' Winnebago Warrior they had was still there and in good shape. He assured me that it was the cleanest one he's seen. I made the 400 mile drive out to Phoenix from Los Angeles with my tow bar, ready to make the purchase and drive home.

When I pull up, they have the RV parked up front waiting for me. As soon as I get close to it, I realized my 800 mile round trip drive was a waste.  The unit is filthy and the windshield is cracked all the way across. I step inside the rv and the filth continues. The carpet is disgusting, there's greasy handprints on the dashboard and all around the engine cover. I fire the engine up and the AC compressor sounded like it was going to explode. When I shut the AC off, I could then hear an exhaust leak from the manifolds.  At this point I was over test driving it. I walked through the unit to inspect the interior that had been shoddily remodeled with plywood and rolled on paint. It looked like maybe a homeless person was using this unit as their primary residence.

When I told Gary it was in pretty rough shape, he still exclaimed it's excellent for it's age and didn't want to admit otherwise. I think he was hoping that I'd buy it because I committed my day to driving out here. My day was already ruined, I didn't need to make it worse by blowing $7500 on an RV that's probably worth closer to $3000.

If I lived locally I wouldn't be leaving this poor review. I'm leaving this review because I had Gary's word that it was worth me investing my day to make the trip to buy his RV when it clearly wasn't. Gary failed to disclose issues that would deem it not only unsafe to drive, but unlawful to drive."
4,1,"Made the mistake of ordering a set of wheels for my 1973 Winnebago from here. The price seemed high at $1100 for a set of used rims, but they were hard to find five lug wheels and I didn't have time to drive around to junkyards in my area. My initial order was on May 23. They charged my credit card on May 25th and said the wheels would be shipped in a couple of days. I contacted them a few times over the next month and the wheels still hadn't shipped. The mechanic that had my RV couldn't wait any longer and said he'd have to start charging me storage if I didn't get it out of there ASAP, so I had to cut my losses and give the RV away. I contacted them to cancel the order on June 22nd and they said that UPS had them, but they hadn't shipped. They asked if I still wanted to cancel and I told them once again to cancel the order and refund my credit card. After that they stopped responding and didn't refund my credit card, so I had to file a dispute with Visa."
4,5,I needed a HD3000MH Allison transmission. They had 5 to choose from and the owner personally showed me what was the best. When I got home I realized that I had grabbed the wrong serial# tranny. They had no problem unloading the old one and putting the correct on in the back of my truck. This place is great for those hard to find RV parts when you are on a limited budget.
4,5,"Wow! If you like tinkering with your RV, this place is your new playground! Start in the office tent, then the containers, then wander around the junked RVs. You will find what you came for- And if you don't.....ask someone! They know where everything is and can locate it!! Good pricing on items large and small. Before you buy new, check here. Everything from cabinet doors to toilets and more hinges and handles than you can imagine. Lights, generators, couches, windows, vents, doors, all the things you need to replace.  Seriously just go look."
4,1,"If you can avoid this place I probably would contact them looking for an engine cover for a 96 Ford E350 style RV they sent me a picture of a engine cover that look pretty close however come to find out it was not even from a 96 did not fit anything within that year when I contacted them and let them know about this mistake they were unhelpful they did not even have the part for that year. 
told me they would give me a partial credit to use with them within 30 days told them I wanted A refund was informed all sales are final even if their staff was incompetent and you getting the proper part to begin with Would recommend going to. VISONE RV SALVAGE. To get your used parts at least they know their product and are straightforward They will do everything to make it right when there is a misunderstanding. Unlike this company!"
4,5,"This is the friendliest, most helpful game for miles around. Give them a try, if they don't have it they'll help find it for you. Yasmin helped us and is so accommodating, she walked the entire yard with us looking for the part we needed."
4,1,"I called Arizona RV salvage on the weekend when they were closed and the owner answered. I needed a speaker for my RV and they said they had one. The owner told me the price was $5 and if I wanted it shipped it would be $8 to ship for a total of $13 plus tax . He said I had to wait till Monday to order it. I called back Monday and gave my information and the lady came back on the phone and told me my order was $20 and change. I stated to her that I was quoted differently on Saturday. While on hold she reversed my charge. Then I said am I going to get it for the price that I was quoted? She said no now it is $10. I told her that I should get it for the $5 that I was quoted and she hung up on me. I called back and they were very very rude to me. I would not ever ever ever recommend anybody going to this place. The staff is so rude. We have bought there before and we will never do it again, if that is how they treat repeat  customers. I would give it a zero rating if I could."
4,5,A stellar group of people!  We came in to get a used motor for slide out but Dan fixed our old one and saved us lots of money!!!!!!
4,5,"What a gem!

When we decided to full-time in an old RV, we had no idea what we were in for. The unexpected projects have just kept coming, and I've had to look at every forum, salvage yard and most RV shops on the southern route across the states. I've tried to pull information from grizzly old repairmen, busy parts managers, and everyone in between. 

This is by far the friendliest team we've encountered on our journey. They let us stay an hour late after our travels delayed our arrival. They let us look through everything (and I mean EVERYTHING), take our time, pull our own parts, and cut us great deals. They gave us bottled water in the Arizona heat, chatted us up, and even checked out our renovation.

After thousands of frustrating and parched miles, they were a kind and helpful oasis (hey, the desert really preserves those parts). I'm so glad we found them!"
4,5,"My engine fan caught the shroud and blew everything to pieces. 
Shot these guys an email and got a quick reply. 
The had the two parts I needed and the price was fare. Shipped them to me in Ca. in short time. 
Couldn't be happier with the service. 
I definitely recommend Az. RV Salvage and will be using them again in the future. 
Eric"
5,5,Great place to rent jet skis from! The staff is super friendly and I appreciate how convenient they make the entire process! We'll be back!
5,5,"Great time with the jet ski rental!  So glad that we did it, made our day at the lake so much more fun! 

Service was excellent at Skiwi, they make it easy to get in and out. Online waiver made it easy for my group to get checked out to take the ski. 

We will definitely be back!"
5,5,Place is cool. We rented two skis for the day. They ran well and so did the tow truck.  It ran very nice.  Believe we meet the owner and he treated us very well. We will be back in April!!!!!
5,5,"This place was simply awesome! So easy to rent a jet ski and the owner and his brother were so nice to us, they even replaced a missing fuse for us for free. They even video the ski before you take it so that when you bring it back there's no arguing over what was there and what wasn't there. I'll definitely be coming back!"
5,5,"This is my go to place for Jet Ski rental!  Very friendly, affordable and within city limits.  You want to call to make your reservations early (like any other place). Very helpful with ANY situation that arises.  We came in and was greeted by Roxy (woof). Then, we signed the paperwork and where fitted for life vest. Trailer was inspected and hooked and off we went.  We had a great time at the Lake and it all started with a great beginning at Skiwi Rental. Definitely will be coming back!"
5,5,"I can not say enough great things about this place. My family and I rented the 21ft jet boat and everything went flawlessly. Our four kids didn't want to get off the inner tube. The service was amazing, we had the best time ever!! Thank you so much!!"
5,5,"This place was great.  The owner was super nice, the front desk lady was super nice.  Very reasonably priced.  We rented two jet skis and a truck for the whole day.  Had a great time on Lake Mead.  I highly recommend renting here if you live in the area or you are just visiting."
5,5,This place is awesome!  We are from san diego and had some trouble with one of our engines on our Yamaha boat.  Initially we were looking for a boat to rent but Craig offered to look at our boat and do our repairs.  He called us four times and went over in detail the things that needed to be repaired. They repaired our boat for far less than we expected and quickly so we could get back out on the water!  They truly went above and beyond and gave us 1st class service! We highly recommend this place!!
5,5,"Good seadoo rentals! The rental was in excellent condition and ran great! Excellent customer service! These are honest guys with great personalities, who are always more than willing to help you out!  In a nutshell, I ended up leaving my seadoos  in Vegas with them for repairs instead of taking them back home to my regular shop in CA! Thanks Todd, Craig, and James! 

Skip all the other places in town for rentals and repairs, these guys know what they're doing and run an honest business!"
5,5,"What an awesome experience!!! We rented pair of wave runners and the owner was so friendly and helped us to get on the road in no time. Very friendly people who's got lots of patience to teach us step-by-step to get on the road. If you're staying in Vegas and want to spend a day at the Lake Mead, this is the place to stop by. It's on the way to the lake and all day rental is definitely worth it. Thanks Skiwi..."
5,5,"Great customer service.   Enjoyed 4 Jet Skis yesterday with friends.  Todd, the owner is super friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely come back."
5,5,Great people .you feel like family.great work honest prices...creig is awesome man..a man of his word hard to find in vegas..they made a new customer and friend
5,5,"I rented a 10 person boat earlier this week for a family reunion and had a great time using Skiwi. The boat was great and the walk through was very nice. They did not make you feel like you were asking any dumb questions. 

I appreciated the life vests that were provided with the rental. I kept the boat past their closing time and when I called to report this I was told to call when we got out of the water as someone would most likely be there. I did and we were able to unload the boat that night - yes, they did charge for the extra time. 

I almost gave a four star review because we arrived before opening an employee was outside and made no effort to be friendly or even a wave hello. This employee, not one of two from New Zealand, seemed to love his cigarettes more than his job and customers. Good thing the selling and face-to-face are with the others. I left there telling my son that that was an example of what not to do when you work in customer service.

I will use Skiwi again and not hesitate to recommend."
5,5,"Look these guys are just the best! We arrived they had our jet skis and truck ready, jet skis were in good condition and ran perfect. Awesome family fun, worth every penny for a day out on the lake. We had a bit of a snag (our fault) the guys at skiwi were really great and understanding. Very personable guys . I will absolutely rent again from them."
5,5,Cheapest place to get a sea doo. The owners were awesome and more than helpful!!!! Best rentals in henderson!!!
5,5,"After checking prices a few different places, decided to go with Skiwi. They were incredibly helpful with our rental of 2 skis and a boat, and made sure we were well prepared for our trip. They were incredibly accommodating, and even came back when they were closed and we needed to drop off. Very satisfied and will definitely use them again!"
5,5,"First time trying jet ski and that was amazing, stuff there was very helpful, they provide all information for beginners. Thanks a lot for great experience!"
5,5,"Craig has the most wonderful customer service and excellent selection of services.  we searched so many other boat rental places in the area and from the minute we got on the phone with Craig we felt very welcome. He took excellent care of us when we came in to pick up the boat, including giving us local tips and best safest routes to take. We would definitely rent from Craig in the future. Highly recommending him to anyone looking to have great boat rental experience."
5,5,"This is hands down the best place to rent watercrafts! I've rented from them a few times and these guys have the best customer service, best machines and best prices. They are conveniently located on Boulder highway, so it's on the way to the lake. Skiwi always has some special going on, especially if you're friends with them on Facebook. You can tell that they take extremely good care of their Waverunners and it shows every time you hit the throttle."
5,3,Rented two jet-skies last week for $250 all day great experience! Good costumer service.
5,5,"skiwi was the best rental business i have been to in las vegas as well as other west coast cities . it was the best rates, nicest staff and most helpful service i have experienced . They make it fast, easy and FUN!"
5,5,"I haven't rented here but the guys that run the place are top notch. I came in looking for a part to fix one of my carbs. Rodger led me out to the ""Treasure Chest."" After digging around for a few minutes we found what I needed and guess what, NO CHARGE!! Thanks so much Skiwi! 

These guys also put in quite a few hours at the lake and are pretty knowledgeable."
5,5,"My husband and I have been renting jetskis here for the last 5 or 6 years and we couldn't be happier with these guys. They're always friendly and professional. The skis are well cared for and work great and their prices are very reasonable. We just show up, quickly complete the paperwork and hook up the trailer with the skis on it to our truck and we're off to Lake Mead. We're so glad we found them years ago. I highly recommend this company if you want to get on the water at Lake Mead!"
5,5,"This was our first time renting a jet ski that was not already on the water - but what a great experience.  I really liked the safety video they had us watch, I thought it was very useful.  The provide as many life-jackets as you need, so need to go out and buy these yourself.  Extremely friendly people, great service, great equipment, we will be back maybe for a boat next time!!!!  PS - Lake Mead water is so warm and clear, perfect!!! :-)"
5,4,I have had 8 Sea-Doos in the past 11 years and treated them like they were Family and A friend of mine rented one from here and it looked and drove like it was a new Machine. I highly recommend you rent from here. A Classy Place.
5,5,"We Saved Money!
Excellent service!
We Have used Skiwi for many years and I have to say Craig and his brother Todd have been amazing. The prices are better then everyone else around. They are always polite ,nice, helpful. Our family has always had a great time with no problems. Highly recommend SKIWI!!!"
5,5,"I must give credit where credit is do... And credit is do to Skiwi!!!  We rented 2 Sea Doo's from Skiwi for a week the last week of July.  Upon arrival we were greeted promptly and with great courtesy and comfort.  After having us watch a safety video they took us out to the ski's where they were waiting in front ready to be hooked up.  They walked around the ski's video taping all minor scratches and imperfections giving me a sense of security.  Once we were done there we got our life jackets and off we went.

Fast forward to the return.  When we arrived back they greeted us like long time friends.  They did the walk through and noticed that the hull had been cracked (after speaking with my son, he admitted that he had run over a rock).  They brought this issue to my attention, but also let me know that I had bought the additional insurance and that it would cover the cost of repair (thank goodness).

We then drove away with 5 smiles in the truck and a life long memory of a great family vacation!!!"
5,1,"This place sucks and they lie.
My nephew and his bride were here from England and my wedding gift for them was a day out on the like with jet skis.
I called on Saturday sept 8th and got some Aussie guy on the phone who took my reservation for 2 jet skis the following morning at 8am, and also took my credit card info.
When we arrived at 8 am the guy in the shop had no idea about our reservation. He had to call the Aussie guy, who then must have remembered me from the night before. Well it was raining on that morning and boulder highway had a section closed due to a marathon race. 
So the guy in the shop told me that they were not renting that day due to the fact that lake mead was closed.
I'd never heard of this before, but I was disappointed and left. My nephew and his bride were upset, but we moved on. I then saw a cop, by the closed section of the highway and asked him if lake mead was in fact closed. He said no and there were two other alternate routes to get there.
So this skiwi rental place flat out lied to us. I ended up renting a couple of high powered skis from their competition who couldn't believe they did that to us, and he gave us a discount. 
Go with vegas jet ski rental. Much more professional and don't lie to their customers and tell them the lake is closed.
Btw, the weather got beautiful later that day and we all had the best day."
5,5,"The guys were real professional and informative.  Great experience, rented a wake board boat it was great. I will  continue to rent from them,hopefully soon."
5,5,"Rent from here!!! Don't think twice!!! Craig the owner was very friendly and informative. The prices here are the best in town. We rented a jet ski. We were unable to return it before they closed, but no big deal because keeping it overnight it's only $50 more if you return it at 7am sharp the next day. That's awesome we enjoyed it all evening. No hidden charges!! They provide as many needed life jackets. The young man outside helped us hook the trailer to our truck and made sure we had enough life jackets. Will return here next year when we come to Lake Mead. You won't regret renting from here, I did many research to find the right place to rent and it was this one!!"
5,5,"We had a great day on Lake Mead yesterday thanks to Skiwi Rentals. Boat and truck ran great. Nice, genuine people who make sure you know how to use the equipment before you leave.Highly recommended; we'll be back soon."
5,5,Skiwi Jet Ski Rentals is AWESOME.  The guys at the shop are super cool and knowledgeable....if it wasn't for them offering advice on where to go in Lake Meade I would not have had HALF the good time that I did.  Their prices are great and my jet ski was cherry.  I will be back the next time I go to Vegas for Sure!  Thanks Skiwi you guys are fantastico!  :)))))
5,5,"Fantastic service with ease of renting!

The gentlemen here made our jet ski rental a breeze! We reserved our rental online which gave us a discount.  I always love getting a discount.  We arrived a little bit after they opened to get our fun day started.  Of course there is a short form to fill out and short video to watch on safety and such.  It's no big deal and completely understandable for rentals.  

Once all of that is finished, they walk you to the rental and look for any damage already on the rental (like a car rental) and mark it on the form.  They do a great job explaining the ins and outs of the jet ski and answer any questions you may have.  Before we knew it, we were at Lake Mead.  Skiwi facility is only 20 minutes from Boulder Harbor Boat Launch inside of the Lake Mead National Park.  

The jet ski ran like a champ and enjoyed a fabulous day on the lake.  I would highly recommend using them for rentals.  They also offer boats to rent for the day.  I just might try that next time!  Thanks Skiwi!"
5,5,"I definitely will be a permanent client,
The service here is very very good!!
Very good and nice people!!!
I can't wait till next time!! Recommend!!!!!"
5,5,"This truly is as good as it gets.  The prices were amazing and they even allowed us to rent an SUV to haul the jet ski that we rented for a small fee.  It was so awesome to be able to rent the jet ski at one low price and have it for the whole day.  On top of the awesome prices, the staff and owner were amazing.  The owner was so nice and really made us feel at home.  We will definitely visit again and highly recommend...much better service and prices than renting on the lake."
5,2,"In todays world with busy schedules getting friends together and our trip planned for Jet Skis at the lake was tuff enough. I prepaid online a reservation for two jet skis and a vehicle to pull to the lake. We arrived to Skiwi Rentals around 8AM. Talking to one of the employees on the phone days prior I was able to confirm a spot where we we were told we could take the jet skis. Showing up and now talking to a different employee, informed us and quote ""You wont be my taking my Jet Skis today then!"" Feeling hopless and not wanting to re plan our trip, we changed location of where we wanted to go. My reservation price  online now somehow has gone up a 100$. I dont argue and pay the total. So now were ready. After a short video the Renatal SUV and Jet Skis are loaded and ready. Before we get on the road we know that we need to put gas in the jet skis or at least top them off so that we could get all day use. At the gas station I had to put 50$ in the SUV and 100$ between the two Jet Skis. (Total 150$) The SUV is posted on thier website as a nice Cadillac. Thus it was a Cadillac, it was completly filthy. The Transmission Light was on, one of the headlights were out and the radio looked as if someone had punched it. Once on the lake the loading was easy and the jet skis ran perfect. However the rope we were given for towing a Wake board was extremly painful to use. By this I was under then impression that tug ropes usually will have a stick or pole like handle. This rope was nylon and had a loop at the end. After a couple attempts of being pulled there was no way I could hold on without ripping skin from my hands. As a beginner I will take this as a learning experience and know what and what not to expect aswell as doing my homework by chosing a more experienced and professinal place of buisness. I will definatly not be coming back here nor would I suggest them. I give this place a couple stars because we all still had a really good time.."
5,5,"Awesome place and very nice owners and staff! I would totally recommend them. However I wish they told me I needed more than spf 30! We did 3 jet skis and they were in good shape, you go over them and mark any damage and one of the employees videos it before you go, no arguing about what damage was there before you return them. You watch a video and you can call them if you have any troubles at all. They called to confirm my reservation and made sure we had everything we needed and it's nice they offer to rent items you can't buy if you're on a trip."
5,5,"There aren't enough good things to say about this family business. From the moment we showed up until we finished our adventure the owners Craig and Teresa were gracious, welcoming and primarily concerned that we enjoyed our trip. Lake Mead was a bit choppy and extremely hot but the watercraft worked great and provided a ton of fun and kept us cool. I will def come back and highly recommend anyone use this fine establishment. *a tip for people waffling for the 2 hour rental at the marina vs all day from Skiwi... The likelihood that you're going to ride the skis for two hours straight is not very likely and this is why you should rent from these guys. If you don't have a truck that can pull the skis they will provide an suv (for $50). The benefit to having the watercraft all day is you can ride for a half hour and then go back and relax, eat something and then go out again."
5,5,Quick and easy! Rented 2 wave runners- good prices- very nice guts- watched a 5 min safety video- even tho we have owned waverunners before- it was a good review for us- i wouldn't use anyone else to rent waverunners! May rent a boat next time- they look nice!
5,5,This place is AWESOME! We rented a couple jet skis this past 4th of July and it was SOOO much fun!! Next year we're getting a boat AND a couple jet skis
5,5,"Me and a buddy rented wave runners and they were awesome, the process was easy and painless!! If your ever in Vegas and thinking about renting a boat or jet ski these are the guys to use!!!"
5,5,"No need to go anywhere else in Vegas, Craig and his team have the number 1 rental facility around ! We rented a high output jetski last weekend and had an absolute ball. The whole process is extremely straight forward. From the moment you arrive, you have someone helping you with paperwork and lifejackets while another person gets your tow package all set and the trailer hooked up. We were in and out super quick and on the lake within an hour. Can't speak more highly about Skiwi rentals ... definitely will be back a few more times at least this summer !"
5,5,This is the company to go to for great rentals and service.  I expect to use them again. Craig and his wife were great. They discussed and mapped places to go. Their service enhanced our day!
5,5,"This place is really great first time renting jet skis, Craig was really helpful I will definitely keep on coming back here."
5,5,Just picked up my wife's boat today after having fiberglass repairs done.  Looks like the boat just came out of the factory.  Fantastic job!  Very awesome people to deal with and wished I could give more stars.
5,5,I wish I could give more stars! They were so amazing and helpful. After a horrible experience at cottonwood cove we came here and I am so glad we did. Skiwi has everything you need down to the equipment for towing. They were so accommodating and even worked with us on a later time for drop off. I will recommend everyone I know to rent from here! Thank you Skiwi Rentals!!
5,5,I was very happy with the service of this company. The Jet ski rental was great and performed to its full potential.  Very happy and will rent from them again.
5,5,"This past Saturday I rented a boat form Todd & Craig at Skiwi Rentals. I rented a 9 passenger and had a 24 year, 19 year old, 2 16 year old's, a 15 year old and my girlfriend along for the ride. We showed up at 745am and Todd, as promised, got us all ready to go and we were off by about 845am. The boat was everything we needed, was in great shape and riding the waves with the AUX Ipod booming away we had an awesome day going! Until around 2pm!! Yes I did the unthinkable, I went over the ski rope and it jammed one of the motors. After following directions and trying to cut the rope away it was just not meant to be so I started up the second motor and we started our long slow ride back to the Marina. We didn't dock until after 6pm and that's when SKIWI closes so I was destined to have to keep the boat for the night, with nowhere to park it, talk about a nightmare in the making!!!!! I decided a long time ago that honesty is always the best policy so picked up the phone around 615pm and called Skiwi...they answered and I told them everything that had happened...to my amazement Todd said ""don't worry mate we'll wait until you get here""! We loaded up, stopped by the gas station to fill the boat and got to SKIWI close to 730pm.  Tools and razor in hand, Craig got to work fixing everything as they had it booked for a Sunday morning rental. In the half hour it took them to fix everything we got to know 2 hard working guys who plain and simple just do the right thing and make sure the customer always comes first. They didn't even dip into the $1000 deposit and my only promise to them was to drip off some cold beers this week. Their reaction, ""don't bother dropping off the cold beer unless your gonna stay and drink a few with us"". Folks if you need to rent a boat or Jetski, I implore you to go no further...These guys from New Zealand are tops and they give us all a little more faith in mankind!!!! Thanks Skiwi, you can use me as a reference ANYTIME and I'll see you later this week for a cold one!!! Cheers..."
5,5,"I have rented from The Lake Mead Marina Harbor, and other places. I most honestly say these guys were awesome! Not only understanding but willing to work with you to ensure you have a safe trip. 

We rented a Yamaha 21ft and enjoyed it. The equipment is efficient and well taken care off. If you need a boat, need a place that is down to earth, don't mind hauling the boat to marina, and need a boat without a prop. This is the place to go."
5,5,This place had great service. Me and a friend rented a jet ski and they taught us everything we needed to know. Had a great day on the lake! Will definitely be back again
5,5,Great product and service from a pair of super friendly guys. We rented a 21ft boat with no issues. Much better prices than anywhere on the water.
5,5,"Rented two jet skis from the guys at Skiwi a couple of weeks ago. Customer service was great, prices were great, and the entire experience went smoothly. Personally, I wouldn't bother going anywhere else from now on. Highly recommended."
5,5,"We rented two jet skis from skiwi and we were very happy with them. They ran perfect all day. They had plenty of power like we were promised. The machines were also in great shape. Every employee we interacted with was friendly and the owner left us smiling and feeling like we were his only customers. They do a very thorough walk around on the machines even recording it on video so there is no chance of having to pay for someone else's damage. My adapter to go from the four prong to the six was broke. The owner borrowed me one after helping me make sure my fuses weren't blown and testing my adapter to be sure that's what was wrong, that's just great customer service. It took about an hour at the shop and we were on the road to the lake. During the hour we got our paper work, watched a short safety video, went over the machines and got some info about the lake. The information we were given, along with a map, were great. We knew enough about the lake (without ever being on it) to easily find anything we wanted to see. We also had enough cool things suggested to us we could have been out there for a week. All in all this is a great business run by people who care about there customers and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to rent a boat to get on to lake mead."
5,5,George did an amazing job on my car.  This was my big splurge and my car was really embrassingly dirty.  They fit me in same day... Dropped it off at my work.  I couldn't have asked for better.  Thanks George this is Kelly rom blu sushi.
5,5,"Amazing! My 2 year old Subaru Outback looks brand new!  I took my car to beaches in Malibu, off-roading in strawberry AZ, and to several mountain biking trails, so she was pretty dirty. George will come to your location and detail your vehicle. He does a phenomenal job and is worth every penny and then some.  If your vehicle needs detail call him and you won't be disappointed!!
Thank you George!"
5,5,"Best in the Biz!! George has been detailing my personal vehicles and my customers vehicles for over 15 years! We only trust our cars, trucks, boats, and RV detailing to him. Prices are very reasonable and the service cannot be beat. Thx GEORGE!!!"
5,5,"Excellent work.  Brought my 13 yr old truck in to prep for sale. She never looked so good!  George got every square inch, inside and out.  Off-road scratches disappeared!
His location is not accurate in Yelp. He is at McFall Tire and Auto. 13564 W Van Buren St, Goodyear, AZ 85338. 
Highly recommended."
5,5,Had to move my son into college this weekend and had a great experience at Phoenix trailer. Ed was professional and very helpful with our rental equipment and U-Haul truck. Thanks for your integrity and help making my son's transition positive!
5,5,Very nice to deal with. Got a 20 foot flatbed a few months ago. Had a warranty issue. They covered it no hassle and very quick.  Highly. Highly recommended.  I wish there were more business owners like this in the world.
5,5,"Search many weeks to find a 18 ft utility trailer with no luck. Until I pulled in Phoenix Trailer Sales. Not knowing to much about a trailer. I met Ed the owner who spent time to show what to look for in a trailer. I was so impressed with Ed's knowledge I came back and ordered his trailer and added some options. Custom built and rolled away a week later. Found what I wanted and the price. Deal Done, It was that easy....Ed will have my business and all my neighbors that love looking at my new trailer in the drive way.
 Thanks Ed

Paul B from Maricopa, Az"
5,5,"I had just made a deal on a motorcycle I was selling and the new owner wanted it NOW! So I needed a trailer to run up to Flagstaff on short notice, Phoenix Trailer had the perfect rig and available now. great service, I'll be back for sure."
5,5,Ed was incredible in helping us purchase our trailer.  His customer service was off the charts.  I will definitely be back and send anyone over there
5,5,"Ed at Phoenix trailer has by far the best customer service ever, he made purchasing a trailer easy and affordable. Extremely recommend phoenix trailer to anybody. If your not happy with phoenix trailer, you just can't be satisfied. Amazing service thanks again."
5,5,The whole process was excellent. I found Phoenix Trailer Sales on Facebook off an ad Ed placed on AZRZR. I purchased an 77/12. Ed helped me with mounting the plate and delivering the trailer it to me. I will refer his business and return when needed with more business. Smooth experience. Thank you!
3,1,"Traveling from Arizona to las vegas. On a 2 way highway we can across a stream of 8 to 10 busses lead by a divine charter bus. These bus drivers are aggressive, going 85 in the left lane on a 2 lane freeway keeping tight and speeding up to ensure cars cannot get around them.  These drivers should be professionals, driving with a bus load of people. It's no wonder these bus accident tragedies occur when companies allow their drivers to act as if they own the roads rather than respectively going a speed that's safe for them, their passangers, and the cars around them. Holding a hire standard of their drivers might be the place to start if they're eny bit concerned about safety."
3,1,"If you respect yourself and think highly of customer service, this is NOT the place to work. There are so many other companies out there that need quality drivers and will treat you as such....NOT DIVINE / MICHELANGELO TRANSPORTATION !!!!!"
3,4,This airport limo service is oustanding. I have to admit that I didn`t expected such a high class transportation form the airport but my wife`s decision definitely touched me gently.
3,5,"Thank you again & again for all the attention that you gave to our 
SAM's group. I've lost count of the number of compliments we've 
received about all of the drivers and greeters. I never had a worry 
regarding ground transportation. You put my mind at ease from our very 
first conversation. I will never be able to express my appreciation for 
all you've done for our conference attendees!"
3,5,It was my wedding and I wanted a limo for me and my beautiful sunshine so I hired Divine Transportation. They sent me the most magical limousine and my wife was soooo happy. She was sparkling whole day. Thank you Divine Transportation for making my day so special.
2.5,1,"Awful, AWFUL day care! Both centers are infested with roaches & the owner does nothing about the problem. Most of her staff is very under educated, and the staff turn over is faster than the speed of light. On top of all of all that, the food that is being served on a daily basis is highly processed. DO NOT send your child to her day care"
2.5,5,"Our daughter has been going to Happi-Time on Stratford since August 1, 2017, so for about six months. I was bothered by the previous reviews but did my own research by contacting parents, and feel like I've seen enough now to leave my own review. Our daughter is 2--now almost 3--and she has truly flourished while at Happi-time. Her main teachers are Brittany and Kendra, and we LOVE them! They are so good to our girl, and I can see the way she responds to them that they treat her right. She has learned a bajillion songs, her colors, counting, is about 98% potty-trained, and all kinds of two-year-old stuff. They do a ton of artwork! And they play outside whenever they get the chance. They put on the cutest Christmas program for the parents. They have a Facebook group for parents where they sometimes post pictures of the kids during the day (which I wish was every day and that my child was in them, but hey). All the staff know our daughter and greet her by name every morning, which you get at a small center like this. We love that the center is diverse in both kids and staff, as our family is diverse. There are families from all walks of life that go here. 

In response to the previous reviews... I don't know if you're a disgruntled past employee or what, but I have never seen roaches and have no reason to think there are any. My child would NOT go there if this was real. Yes, the food is mostly processed. I'm sure this helps the center remain affordable, honestly. Kids are picky eaters, so god bless them. If you want your child to eat couscous and fresh avocado, get a nanny. The carpet on the older kids' side of the left building is a bit dirty, especially in winter, because EVERYONE has to walk through there (and the kitchen) to get to every other part of the building. I do wish it was set up differently and that they used the other door, which would require installing another key code system. I believe they vacuum it after drop-off time, and that room is set up to where the floor play areas take place in spots that don't get walked through so that helps. As far as the ""education"" of the daycare employees goes, they seem to be proficient in their ABCs, counting, days of the week (in two languages), and safe behavioral management techniques. For what it's worth, my husband and I both have master's degrees, and I don't feel that this is necessary at a daycare--particularly as the pay would not be commensurate with the degree. I've met a lot of a-holes with advanced degrees. Our teachers are well-spoken, and at least two of the teachers speak both Spanish and English. What's most important is that she is kept safe, that she feels loved, that she is corrected in order to learn right from wrong and to show respect, that she is able to run off energy, and that she learns all of the basic age-appropriate lessons to take her into preschool. They do all of that! I know when I drop my daughter off that she is being taken care of well. They are kind people and we are happy with this daycare."
2.5,1,Do not take your kids there. The carpet is disgusting and the teacher for toddlers # Sarah# is mean with the kids.
3.5,1,Terrible!! Gave plenty of time to replace back up camera for trailer. Calls day before installation...says he can't find it..BS my wife found the same camera in minutes on Amazon. Then the guy has the nerve to hang up on me!! If your looking for reliable this is not it!!!!!!
3.5,5,"They rock!  I live in Fountain Hills, AZ and I called and talked to Charlotte who was so nice.  We had the RV ready to roll for a 4 day trip, dogs in their beds and come to find out one of the hydraulic jacks was stuck down and fluid on the pan and ground.  She initially told me it would be sometime after 3pm because they were busy then said, wait a minute and let me call my guys to see where they are.  She called back in 10 minutes and Mike is on his way and will be here by 11am.   I can't even tell you how grateful I am that she took the time to help us on our way.  I will absolutely use them in the future.  Thanks so much for caring about us and our trip. It's very rare these days to get this kind of friendly service!"
3.5,5,"Fantastic repair service.  We have been basically living in our motor home for most of the last year.  We have traveled over 10,000 miles.  Our motor home is an older unit and we have needed frequent repairs.  ASAP is, with out a doubt, the best repair service we have found.  They are on time.  They communicate.  Their people are knowledgeable and friendly.  They know what they are doing.  We will use them again for our next problem in the Phoenix area"
3.5,5,"Joe came out last week and greased the wheels on my travel trailer. He arrived early to the appointment and got right to work. I appreciated being able to watch the job get done (which is more than I would be able to do if I'd taken it to Camping World!). So, I know it got done and got done right. Couldn't have been more pleased. I would definitely call ASAP again."
3.5,1,"I was excited to see a mobile RV repair service with such great reviews.   I recently purchased a vintage trailer that needed a couple of repairs that were outside my abilities and I needed an expert's assistance.   I am anxious to get it on the road!   I called and left messages twice within 4 days and never received as much as a call back.   That's not what I would have expected from a service that had great reviews, and has ASAP in their title."
3.5,1,"Would not recommend simply because of the dangerous driving of the repair truck I came across on the road near Pennington and w Keating Ave. 

The driver attempted to run a stop sign while I was midway through the intersection on my turn. When I honked to let him know that he was dangerously close to me, he decided to turn behind me and drive irresponsibly close to my vehicle to urge me to drive over the speed limit in a residential area where kids from a church could be running around. 

At the next stop sign, believe it's at Longmore or Roger's Ave, he again remained dangerously close, refusing to stop at the sign behind me. 

When I got up to the speed limit of 30, possibly a few mph over, he revved his truck and sped around me at a good 45-50 mph, gaining a great distance from me. However again, this is right near a school. Past Roger's Ave in an elementary /middle school that he decided to speed through on a school day. 

This is not proper behavior of an employee of a company that I could ever use. I would avoid them at all costs simply because if they drive so recklessly, what kind of reckless work would they do during repairs."
3.5,5,"Dan completed some warranty work on my motorhome.  Whenever warranty approval is required for a repair, it can be a huge hassle.  Dan and the people at ASAP Mobile RV Repair went above and beyond to make sure all the approvals were submitted, parts were ordered, and work was done before we left Phoenix.  Dan is extremely conscientious about his work.  He made sure that all the work he did was done right.  He was also very friendly and personable.  Service rates were also reasonable.  I would definitely call him again!"
3.5,1,We have used ASAP a few times over the past 7 years and Joe has always been great!  Last week I called and texted them 4 times for help with my RV and no return calls or return texts.   I wonder if they sold their business?
3.5,5,"We've used Joe's rv repair service twice.  We're full timers and being on the road for 6 months or so every summer we always have some issues when returning to the Phoenix area each fall.  He's a very friendly but serious fellow.  Both times he showed up on time, I point and he fixes !   About as easy as it gets.  He has over 25 years experience and it shows.  He charges  $75 for the service call and $90 for repair time.  This is a bargain...let me explain.   After 28 years of FULL TIMING I've been there.  Most rv repair shops pull your rig into the bay and tell you to get lost.  Then you get the bill and there's always some unexpected and unexplainable charge.  And most of these guys charge around $120 per hour.  With Joe you can stand right next to him while he makes your repairs...he might even say  ''can you hold the other end of this''.  .Or you can sit inside your rig with a cup of coffee.   He has no objection to you ordering the parts you need and having them laying on your patio when he arrives.   Once I asked him to bring a new roller spring for my awning and his price was less then anyone on the internet.   A while back I realized I had to replace the spark plug wires on my 454 chevy.  I purchased an expensive set and then I lifted the hood...WOW .NO WAY...not going to happen !   I took the truck to a garage I knew to be reasonable in the past with me and their price was $180.   Joe has years of experience with a chevy dealership.  He replaced the wires in 30 minutes, my cost at $90 per hour - $45 bucks.  And remember that I didn't have to sit in some ''customer lounge'' waiting for some kind of bad news.  If joe can't fix it....YOU HAVE A BIG PROBLEM.  Oh yeah, he fixes those too.  But here's the best part you guys.  When you call to make an appointment his secretary is a real charmer !"
3.5,5,"I was looking for an alternative to the local RV Dealers.  My rationale was that having to deliver my fifth wheel to them and then go back and get it is a MAJOR drag.  I also felt like the big boys in the area are over charging for some of their services.  I found ASAP Mobile RV service via google and I figured I would give them a try.  I got a quick response to my email inquiry and then called and spoke to a very nice lady who scheduled an appt for the very next day.  Joe showed up at my house exactly on time, he went through the issues I was having and was honest about the solutions.  He ordered the parts (whilst on my driveway) and then told me he would be back first thing 2 days later.  Sure enough he arrived 10 mins early and got to work straight away.  2 hours later he had replaced two faucets, replaced a vent fan and changed out my generator carburretor.  The service was good, the prices were honest and I am extremely happy with the outcome.  I will recommend ASAP to anyone who will listen and I will be using them from now on for all my RV/Travel trailer needs.  It is nice to see a small business doing things right and I wish Joe and the team great success."
3.5,5,"I used Asap Mobile RV Services to service my mobile dog grooming van Dog Gone It Mobile Pet Spa LLC. Joe was prompt, knowledgeable,  friendly, and very professional. I was very pleased with their service."
3.5,1,"Had these guys come back in June to do the yearly service and some fixes to my trailer and my friends trailer.  Joe and his collegaue showed up to my house and  I had my friends trailer over, so they had both in one spot.  The prices the charged me werent good, I followed up with Camping world and unfortunately the big corp was cheaper - this wasnt the case in 2011 when I first met Joe.  I asked Joe and his colleague to fix several things, they did the easy ones and never came back.  I was out of town when Joe fixed the stuff that needed parts and he called me constantly looking for payment, he even arrived at my house and requested it from my wife (I was in a conference for work, so couldnt answer the phone at all during the day).  This was dissappointing and the last time I will use ASAP mobile RV services."
3.5,5,"Joe and his team are awesome, fast service and keep ya in the loop for warranty stuff."
3.5,5,"I called ASAP to fix my RV's refrigerator and awning. The fridge was a simple fix, Joe was honest and just made a quick adjustment.  He also replaced my awning and it turn out awesome.  His fees are super reasonable, they're very friendly/courteous, and on time.  I highly recommend Joe and his team at ASAP for any RV repair.  On top of the great service, they're mobile and come to you!!"
4,5,"We bought our Aerolite 282 there in December '16. The sales experience was great but I wanted to wait until we had a chance to use the RV a few times before I made a comment. 

First off, we drove down from Philadelphia to save nearly $10k.  Everything was excellent. Cindy was our saleswoman (awesome!!) Rich was great to do the paperwork with and I couldn't ask for a better mechanical walk through than what we got with Greg. Ultimately, every single person we dealt with from reception to drive off was way more helpful, friendly and professional than anticipated.

I'm a member of several forums where I read about people complaining about things that the dealer should have caught and fixed. So glad we went to Golden Gait for our 1st RV. I don't care where we live in the country, they WILL be my RV dealer when we go for a new model."
4,1,Beautiful RVs but terrible service. I came here looking to purchase a 5th wheel or a Class A and walked around the entire parking lot looking at RVs but never once did anyone come out to ask if I needed anything or had any questions. I walked in twice asking questions and still no one came out to greet us or help out. However there were plenty of people there that were just standing around talking. I could never spend money somewhere that doesn't seem to even want my business.
4,5,"Just purchased a horse trailer from Golden Gait. It was a wonderful experience, all the way from Steve Brittain, our sales rep, to Richard Hoppe, the credit manager. Everyone was very courteous and professional. I highly recommend this company if you are in the market for an RV, or horse trailer."
4,5,"Golden Gait went above and beyond to help us out with a previous purchase. Irene was kind and helpful, she kept in contact with us until our issue was resolved. We made the original purchase here at Golden Gait and will 100% be returning to them when the need arises.  
Thanks for all your help!"
4,5,"My wife and I just purchased a travel trailer from Golden Gait, and overall we were very happy with the entire process!  The environment was a very low-pressure, relaxed environment.  Everyone there (from the sales rep to the finance manager to the service department staff) was friendly.  

As I understand it, they've just recently gotten into the RV / travel trailer side of the house.  So give these guys a look for when you want to buy."
4,5,"Bought a Little Guy Rough Rider off road teardrop trailer and absolutely love it. The buying experience was great and quick. No hassles, just straight honest sales. Can't wait to take it out camping."
4,5,"Flew in from out of state to purchase a class B motorhome and was simply blown away! Deric Schare is helpful, knowledgeable, and most of all trustworthy. I purchase, on average, 2 cars or year and have owned several motorhomes. That being said this was one of the best experiences I have had as a buyer.
Deric have me a great deal! He has an awesome selection of new tab and tag trailers but what caught my eye was the frequency with which they acquire class B motorhomes. I never considered buying a class B motorhome from a dealer as I feel they overcharge for what amounts to a used van . In this dealership it is the exact opposite.
Deric answered all of my questions and then some. He has made himself available to me by phone, and takes my calls even well after the purchase.
Anyways go see the man! He will pick you up at the airport if you are coming from out of state. Mention my name and get 75% off any RV (ok that's a lie )."
4,1,"Nevada RV people are nice (Deric and John).  

However, they are not transparent and misrepresented the Tear Drop camper we purchased.  As soon as we drove away had problems.  The AC would not blow cold air.  The refrigerator would not cool.  There was a window screen missing.  The battery was shot and kept draining the car battery.  STAY AWAY.  Very disappointing for driving across the country and being overcharged for something that had so much wrong with it."
4,4,"I've spotted these retro teeny-tiny camping trailers being towed by cars on the highways of So-Cal. It was love at first sight. I love the idea of hitting the road on a whim and exploring the great outdoors. My husband and I jumped at the chance to check these out in person after finding them in town at Nevada RV. 

Features Overview: 
These 'Little Guy' teardrop trailers pack a punch with the amount of features they fit into their tiny package. They offer a queen sized bed with nice cabinetry, lighting, roof ventilation, privacy screens, and even offer an outdoor galley kitchen. 

Size Options: 
These 'Little Guy' varieties are available in 4′, 5′, and 6′ wide. They're ideal for 1 to 2 adults (with small pets and a kid). This is what we came to admire and try out (to ensure my 6'2 husband would even fit it-he did). They also offer other options that include the T@G- T@B- and other larger versions if that's you're thing (see pictures for an idea of the various sizes they had in stock during our tour). 

We were really hoping to scope out the T@G or Rough Rider versions and they didn't have them in stock due to their popularity. This isn't a huge deal since we were just window shopping at the moment. 

Overall, the gentleman onsite was warm, friendly and answered all of our questions during our tour.  Their prices were comparable with what we are finding online and we're looking forward to coming back and seeing the other versions when they're back in stock."
4,1,"Called them to ask about labor rates for a few minor repairs, was met with very rude comments like, ""thats like calling a doctor with a broken leg and asking for prices"".  I asked about changing out rear brake hardware and he quoted me 4 times the amount they cost at the store, and then said it would be $100 in labor just to change out hardware, its like a half hour job, should be like $50 tops.  Most of their reviews are just plain fake, they werent even open in Goodyear yet and they had like 10 five star reviews."
4,5,"The very best in class service and experience. Integrity is their middle name. They hold themselves accountable to platinum customer service and value and embrace a philosophy of generously giving back to the community . Champ and Heather are a husband and wife dynamic duo who take pride in working hard to earn a solid reputation of trust that is second to none. A rare gem to find in the auto repair industry. From oil changes to transmissions repairs, they have the right answers to meet and exceed expectations for any auto repair need and are consistent in their delivery every single time. Need I say more? The best!!"
4,5,"I was driving to Tucson when my axle broke on my car. I am from out of town and had the bad feeling I was gonna get ripped on repairs from a local mechanic. 

 A guy recommend I take it to Champs. I figured why not. I was really lucky to find my way here. They had a reasonable price for the repair and got me back on my way the same day they worked on it.

 I had to wait the day for the repairs but they have a great air conditioned waiting room (I think it was over 100 out) where me and my son waited watching tv.

 The shop itself is clean and the employees are above board professional.  I was never talked down to or forced pressured into repairs.  I was extremely satisfied with service and repairs. Definitely recommend this shop!!!!"
4,1,"I brought my car to Champs family auto to have service on my vehicle and to compare them to another place so I can have one place to bring my other vehicles. The place is nice and the workers are friendly. Things I would like others to beware of. I brought my car here knowing I would be paying a little extra for labor but I wanted my car fix correctly the first time. First, YOU WILL OVERPAY FOR PARTS. They will overcharge you for all parts which I was not happy with. If you use them, bring in all your own parts unless you don't mind being overcharged. Communication was good but needs improvement because they will only tell you one thing at a time so you have to keep adding on service instead of an overview of all your options. I had to stop getting repairs because I reached my budget and they were still adding things one at a time. That is the major downfall of dealing with them. I picked up my car and got it home and now MY CAR WON'T START. It was starting fine when I took it to them and drove it back home. But once you leave the good communication is over and they act like they don't know you. The last thing to point out that I didn't pay attention to is that they have good reviews on Yelp, but look how spread out the dates are. That is a good sign. Nice people though. Wish them the best."
4,5,"Great service, great prices, and quality work on my diesel truck.  Chris was able to get me in on the same day for glow plug replacement, the cost was less than half of the dealer and I'm more confident in the work at Champs.  Definitely a shop worth going back to."
4,5,"Heard thru the grape vine that Champs runs a honest auto mechanic business. First time for me here... They were very friendly and took the time to explain to me about my power-steering pump that when I was getting quotes was going to cost 500 plus. 
       Here Champ the owner or one of them, charged me $200 and replaced the belt. They let me know it that the power-steering pump was taking in air and didn't need to be replaced. 
      Thanks guys I will be back. I love family businesses !!!!"
4,5,"Professional, exceeded expectations. Brakes and rotors replaced--completely fixed the problems! Finished the job within a few hours. I will be taking my car in for repairs from this point forward."
4,5,Friendliest people working there!! They are patient and handled all our questions and needs. Their prices are unbeatable. They also gave us a ride to our house to wait since we didn't live far and they were working on our only vehicle. Champs employees are amazing prices amazing their work is amazing! We will be going to them for all our truck needs.
4,5,"Champ's serviced my Jeep right before Memorial Weekend 2014. I had them do a general safety inspection before heading to California. I was a little skeptical at first, but after it was all done I was completely satisfied. Josh and Chris, complete professionals. Note, even after being backed up with work, they still took my Jeep. I had explained to them my concerns about traveling to L.A, they understood. Made it to L.A and back with no problems. I'll be going back to Champs on the regular."
4,2,"happy camper, 
Champs have done work on my truck two other times, all work was done correctly and seemed to be a fair price. so I took the truck back for a third time to fix an issue with a extra fuel tank in the bed of the truck. after two weeks and driving away from the service center on three different  times. the first time we picked up the truck and was told all work was completed, drove about 100 miles and truck broke down on the freeway, had to have towed back to champs. they called up and said the truck was fixed again, picked up and my wife drove about four miles away and truck started having issues with fuel again. so back to champs. couple of days later received a call and said they guarantee  that the fuel lines were all correctly hooked up and the truck was ready to go. guaranteed  that all issues were corrected, picked up Friday filled tanks with fuel. took a drive on Sunday around 100 miles, well I found out that I was pumping fuel out on the freeway almost the whole way. I guess the fuel lines were not correctly installed. called Monday morning and notified Chris at champs that the truck was dumping fuel out the back tank. he said ok. 
I then drove across the valley to another shop to have them look at the tanks and fuel lines. he was under the truck for less than a minute and said the two return fuel lines were not correctly hooked up right. he also ask who had worked on the gas lines, the lines looked like they had been sliced up with a razor blade. the new switching valve  that had been replaced had the old wiring harness re-installed and should have had the new one that comes with the new valve was not used. the wiring harness was forced on and broken. so this repair cost me another 300.00 dollars to fix something that champs guaranteed me they had fixed.
so I took a copy of the bill and stopped by the champs center. spoke with champ and chris, explained to him what the other repair center said. I had them write down all of the issues on the copy of the bill so I could show champ. both listened to me and said we will talk to our employees. that was it.
I guess when a service center guarantees their work it only goes so far. I would not,  recommend this auto shop to anyone at all. it is a shame that when they can not have the good common sense  to say they made a mistake and sorry you had to go somewhere else to fix our problem. I was not expecting any compassion from champs, maybe half of the bill since I paid them to do the same repair. but did not happen. so when they tell you they guarantee their work and don't,  just talk, never again"
4,5,"This is without a doubt the best experience I've ever had in the car repair world. A great price, great people and great service"
4,5,I just want to say that since Champs was unable to repair the truck as needed. Champ did call the other day after receiving the bill from the other garage who was able to fix the problem. Champ said he would be sending a check for the amount of the repair from the other garage. I did receive the check today. I wanted to thank champ for doing this. Not many shops would have done that. Thanks again for your help in this matter. Happy camper
4,5,"Took my truck in for repair and they were great! Very friendly and honest, and they do great work. I will definitely be taking all my vehicles there in the future.  

The owner, Champ, was fantastic. He kept me updated throughout the day as they were diagnosing the vehicle and left me with absolutely no surprises. 

My initial reaction.....customer for life!"
4,1,"Took my Expedition here for some work. They suggested completely draining my transmission fluid and replacing it. Unknowingly, I okayed for it. My transmission was toast!
I took my Expedition to my main mechanic and he said that you never completely empty the transmission fluid. You replace it in stages as to keep any metals from damaging the transmission. My mechanic said that any true mechanic should know this!!!
$3,500 later I had to buy a new transmission!!!
Thanks for nothing.
STAY AWAY!!!"
4,5,"We recently took a trip to Arizona. Our Dodge 3500 was making a noise and we wanted to get it checked out before we continued on the road. We called the Dodge Dealer, and they told us they couldn't see us until the following week. We called another automotive shop and were told they could not see us for three days. BUT, they referred us to Champs Family Automotive in Goodyear, Az. We were only a few miles from there, so we called them, they told us to come right in and they would see what they could do for us. From the first phone call to paying the bill, we had excellent customer service. Josh explained to us that he needed to keep the truck over night, but that Craig would take back to where we were staying. We loaded our Golden Retriever in the beautiful company car, (leather seats, black, and very clean until our Golden got in). Josh kept us updated on the parts he needed to get, the possible problem, and an approximate time he would finish the job. When the truck was done, Craig drove out and pickup us up, and drove us back to the shop. Josh explained exactly what he did on the truck, what still needs to be serviced, and the bill was more than reasonable. All of the employees were so nice, and didn't mind the dog in their shop. We live in California, and plan to return to Champs Family Automotive to have the rest of the work done on our truck. We have family in Surprise, Az, and Josh said he would schedule us for the work when we come back over. The mileage we are now getting went up 20%, the truck sounds great, and we couldn't be happier, If you are looking for an honest, reasonable, friendly auto shop, look no further. Champs is were you need to go. Thank you Josh."
3.5,5,Brought our motorhome in to have big dents with pain damage on the hood and front cap.  Cassones did a fantastic job on the damage repair and the paint looks better than new! Friendly and hand down the best RV collision place in the valley.
3.5,5,Great customer service & great repair work by Chad! They replaced our black tank under extended warranty & really took the time to explain the process to us & then followed up to make sure new tank got ordered & arrived in time while we were here in Mesa. Highly recommend!
3.5,1,"I have no idea how this business got good ratings. I called them to address a couple of problems with my motor home which is parked literally right next to them. The Service Mgr and a tech showed up the next day to inspect the issues which consisted primarily of fabricating a flat-screen TV mount, a torn slide out awning and a sticky slide out. They left promising an estimate. That was five weeks ago. I've called the Service Mgr twice to figure out what's going on and after a bunch of evasive BS have not even heard from them in almost a month. I should mention that I turned to Cassones only after an even worse example of customer service from Arizona RV Service. The only substantive difference between the two companies is that AZ RV has not followed through since December ( it's mid-February now). I should stress that this is not a case of price-haggling. I have never even gotten an estimate from either of these two allegedly ""4-Star Rated"" Companies. Stay far, far away."
3.5,5,Richie and the guys down there are absolutely great! I highly recommend Cassone's and smooth finish to anyone.
3.5,5,"I love this place. Damn friendly, reasonable prices, & very knowledgable techs. They give honest opinions & good advice. I'm still kicking myself for bringing my trailer to World Wide RV down the street. After a week of frustration I pulled it here and everything was resolved within 48hrs and at a better price point. Ask for Chad. They need to clone that guy."
3.5,5,"Recently took my Toy Hauler into these guys to have them do the wheel bearings of which they had the best price on in town.  I also asked them to look a few things over for me.  They did find alot of things that needed to be taken care of but i just bought it and wanted to take it back to the place i bought it from who should have not sold it to me in that condition.  they had about 2 hours of diagnostic time that they waived for me for looking over my coach.  I really appreciate them working with me and helping diagnose the issues as they really could have charged me for it.  I believe they are running a good business and will be taking my toy hauler there for service from now on.  Jason, Richard, and Rocky took great care of me.  Thanks guys."
3.5,2,"I purchased my RV in February 2016 and took out of state delivery in California.  The title process was terrible...it took almost four months to get clear title despite paying cash at the dealership.  

There were a few issues noted before we left that lot that the owner and salesman said they would take care (some of which they put in writing), some issues were not disclosed...that would have caused us to either walk away or negotiate a better deal.  Two significant issues, the check engine light kept coming on (not disclosed until the delivery driver told us in CA, after we signed the papers) and the fuel gauge would drop to empty.  Minor issues like the slide toppers were supposed to be replaced and were either not replaced or missing.  

The owner seemed like he genuinely wanted to help and would make things right...but then stopped returning calls or trying to help. I even offered to drive back to AZ and again, no return call.  I truly thought that they would be decent to deal with...but their actions were quite the opposite."
3.5,5,"Great place. We stopped here to see on the possibility of having our rig's dash AC looked at; Richard (I presume he is the owner?) was welcoming and reassured us that it would be no problem to have it looked at the next morning (which is when we requested as we were rolling out later that day). Richard personally examined our Coach's system, let us know the realities of what we were working with, and then was honest in stating that this type of repair wasn't really necessary unless we deemed it so (oh, hey honesty over making $$). He also checked out a few other items for us and imparted little tidbits of knowledge to us (this is our first Coach!). Anyways, all the guys there were chill but busy (good sign), but took the time out of their tasks and days to help us out. Nice moves Cassone's! Totally recommended."
3.5,1,"***BUYER BEWARE***CLASSIC SHADY USED CAR DEALER***SERIOUSLY CONSIDER DOING BUSINESS ELSEWHERE***

I purchased a used RV on consignment from Cassone's in early September of 2016. After 12 years in the RV industry, both buying and selling, consigning, and teching, I feel the need to give an honest review of Cassone's RV.  In addition to having issues meeting the conditions of the ""We Owe"", there were several other instances that raised red flags at Cassone's.


RV was not detailed or ozoned to remove smoke smell.  Delivered with feces in toilet, kitchen covered in grease, tobacco stains on vents, hornets nests on storage space, delivery driver spilled and left candy.

Work order documentation received was inaccurate, completed after the fact, services added that were never performed, no hours recorded, no price of parts.  No PDI or SFD information was given

Sub standard repair of leveling hydraulic system, failed with first use, hydraulic actuators incorrectly installed.

Delivered with 3/4 full sewage tank that was broken and clogged.

Charged a $500 fee for delivery.  Delivery driver for Cassone's is the father of the gentlemen who owns the dealership.  He lives in the back of the lot, and provides ""24 hour security"" when not delivering RVs.  He was a extremely nice, kind, and polite older man, but he was all over the road, constantly swerving out of his lane, eating candy while driving, and spilling it everywhere.  

When asked to fix the above issues, EJ made it clear he would not work with me because he had not made enough money from me.   He actually said that to a customer.

All in all, it was an absolutely horrific experience purchasing an RV at Cassone's.  You couldn't pay me to work with them again on any level.  This place feels like a shady used car lot, and the behavior is exactly that.  I was made contract promises that they could not, or had no intention, of honoring. I was not told of known issues with the RV.    Bargaining didn't cease until the RV was delivered.  Cassone's uses an unlicensed, uninsured, unbonded, and unprofessional delivery agent.  They will not handle damages made during delivery.  They will not call you back.

If you decide to make a purchase or bring in your RV for maintenance to Cassone's, you may not have to deal with all the issues, lies, and unprofessionalism that I did.  On the other hand, it is very likely you will have to put up with at least one of these areas where Cassone's falls short."
3.5,1,"This review is based on our experience with Cassones RV regarding their consignment services.  We haven't purchased anything from Cassones and cannot give our opinion on services relating to sales.  However, if you are considering consigning your RV with Cassones you will want to continue reading this review.

We enlisted the services of Cassones to help us sell our 2016 Entegra Aspire.  They picked our coach up and delivered it to their dealer lot.  They ""staged"" the coach which simply meant they pulled out all of the slides, turned on all of the lights, and took pictures.  Our coach was parked on their lot from the end of November 2017 until the middle of September 2018.  Since we listed the coach with them during the busy season in Arizona we had high hopes it might sell.  During the 10 months it sat on their lot we had one interested party, however we could not agree on the price. 

While our coach was in Cassones' possession damage had occurred to our windshield.  We were not immediately notified of the damage, in fact it was after we contacted Cassones for an update that we were then informed.  We were told that someone walking by the lot must have thrown a rock at the windshield.  At the time, the salesman was very apologetic and offered to cover half of our deductible when the windshield was replaced.  He advised that we wait until we have an offer on the coach before replacing the windshield.  We decided about a month later to have the windshield replaced as we had plans to discontinue consignment with Cassones due to their inability to sell our coach.  After we discussed this decision with our salesman and reiterated that he agreed to pay half of the deductible he quickly back tracked and said that the deductible was too much and they wouldn't be able to do half.  Rather than deal with Cassones to get our windshield replaced, we told him we would take care of the windshield ourselves and the deductible if they could make sure the fluids were topped off, the tires were full of air, the coach was clean inside and out.

Once we picked up our coach to move it to storage, we also noticed that the windshield wipers had dry rotted and were hanging from the blades.  We were told they rinsed the coach off and that the inside gets cleaned once a week, so it was clean.  We didn't inspect it as we should have.  Once we got it to our storage facility we went inside and noticed that they left their few pieces of decor that they added and that the coach was not clean.  The floor was disgustingly dirty, dead bugs everywhere, and the shower door molding was coming off.  There was no evidence that the coach was cleaned on a weekly basis.  Also, the fluids were not topped off as previously requested.  

Just be aware if you plan to cosign your coach with Cassones RV.  They will not take care of your property as you expect they would.  It is no wonder our coach didn't sell, with a busted windshield, rotted windshield wipers, and absolutely filthy inside, this would not appeal to any buyer.  A side note, once we informed Cassones that we were no longer going to consign our RV, the salesman informed us that he had someone interested that he had been working with for a couple of months and would be back in Arizona in October.  Not once during that past several months were we informed of an interested party.  My guess is there wasn't anyone interested, that they didn't want us to pick up our coach and see the terrible condition that it was in."
3.5,5,"Five Star Customer Service.   I am so happy we used Yelp to discover Cassones RV to prepare our fifth wheel for traveling this summer.  We had our RV cleaned inside and out including exterior waxed.  Also, we had the wheels and brakes checked.  The outcome was a ""like new"" fifth wheel that made me love it all over again.  Richard made sure every detail was taken care of above and beyond.  He is very knowledgeable and hands-on.

I was extremely worried that the inside would have an offensive smell like some used RVs I have toured in the past- this did not happen. (I even went as far as writing him a note about my concerns and expectations.)    It was fresh smelling and every inch shined.   On the mechanical side, Rich's team took exceptional care of checking the brakes, wheels and other safety issues.  They did not try to sell us something we didn't need.  We were contacted several times to update us on the status of repairs.  My husband and I were pleased with the service and price.

We will be returning customers.   Thanks!"
3.5,1,Tried getting a hold of them and they don't ever answer there phone during business hours.
3.5,1,We purchased a RV from this place it has been the worst purchase ever. The warranty they sold us is BS and the RV is A POS. After threatening them with the lemon law the actually fixed part of the problem.. please really consider purchasing from them. My husband called them to try to trade the RV and they will not return our call. So we tried giving them another shot at being a good business and they failed once again. The only decent person there is kyle in the service dept.
3.5,4,Richard graciously jumped into our customer service issues for prompt resolution. The quality of their service tech was exceptional. Thank you Richard and team for earning back our patronage!
3.5,1,If you don't need your repairs completed anytime soon this place may be alright. After four weeks in the shop I am still working with them on understanding what needs to be repaired. Poor internal communication and you almost always go to voicemail. Pick up the phone!!
3.5,4,"We had a 24 foot camper we wanted to consign. Tess came and inspected it. She went over the consignment agreement with us. After signing the contract, they came and picked up the camper. It only took a couple months for it to sell. Jason worked hard to get the sale. We feel we got a reasonable price for it. Thank you to all at Cassones."
3.5,5,"I have been taking my RV to Cassones for the past 3 years and I am very satisfied with the service department!  Chad is there to greet you and to listen and write down the concerns that you have about your coach.  I never feel rushed when I take my RV to Cassones and Chad always takes the time to answer any questions that I have.

3.5,1,"This is the most corrupt consignment in the Mesa  area. I bought a used rv from them first the roof leaked and then the transmission had to be replaced. I asked them to change all the fluids, they charged for it and clearly didn't do it. Don't Buy anything from these crooks!"
3.5,5,Fast and friendly service. Very affordable prices. I drove over 30miles for a quality oil change and I must say that's exactly what I received. Thanks again Dell. I will definitely be back.
3.5,5,"Very polite staff. Punctual with their service, didn't have to wait a long time for them to get my car going."
3.5,5,"Walked in and the place was nice and cool, customer service was great, and it took 25 min for an oil change can't beat it. I will be back."
3.5,5,What can I say they were fast great amazing customer  service they communicated with me prices and gave me out deals  they were diligent and caring and took good care of my car while it was in there care I would recommend this place to everyone!!!!! Definitely worth it!!!
3.5,5,Dale was great!  Did a great job  had a coupon which helped   Was quick too! My husband told me what to write
3.5,1,"What a ripoff! I bought a Groupon for a FULL SYNTHETIC oil change which I have done other places with no problem. I was charged $10.95 for labor, an extra $6 for an oil filter,  $6.11 shop supply fee, $10 disposal fee. When all was said & done it was a total of $82.54 & he deducted $39.99 for the groupon and charged me $43.54 on top of the Groupon! When I called him & confronted him on the charges his fake friendliness fell apart. He yelled at me and hung up. I just wanted a simple oil change, not to be ripped off. Beware! His friendliness is just to get you to open your pocketbook,,,,it's all fake! I wonder how many other people he has ripped off & they didn't even realize!"
3.5,5,I didn't set up an appointment but they made time for me to get an oil change right away. They were somewhat busy right after I came in and they still made accommodations to get everyone taken care of. I'll definitely come back in the future.
3.5,5,"Very fast, quality work. Very friendly. Also ask for Andy. Here's really easy to talk to and explains your options."
3.5,1,"I feel like we have been conned by these guys. We took in our 2013 chevy sonic (never had ac problems before) in for a recharge before summer. 3 weeks after recharge at Xpress the ac goes out. They charged us another $70 for an inspection and EVAC recharge (even though we had already paid for the groupon) and let us know that we needed an ac kit. We decided to stick with Xpress for the ac kit replacement (BIG MISTAKE) and were charged just over $1250. That charge included parts, labor, and a THIRD charge for the ac recharge. About three weeks after having the ac kit replaced, the ac went again. We took the cars back to xpress because we assumed that the problem would be under the warranty of the ac kit that we just bought, we were wrong. Xpress informed us that we needed a new ac line, which is not included in the ac kit and is not covered by warranty. They charged us $206 and some change for the part, labor, and a FOURTH recharge for the ac. We have all receipts to show this information accurately. On top of all this, they tried to sell us a tune up and a new timing belt twice even though we informed them the first time that we were not interested. Chevy recommends that our car be tuned up at 100,000 miles and our car has just over 80,000. They tried to sell us a timing belt instead of a timing chain. Our chevy has a timing chain, that according to the dealership, should never need to be replaced."
3.5,5,"Found on groupon and had an amazing experience. Quick service, affordable, and the guy at the front counter was funny and welcoming. Would definitely recommend!"
3.5,4,"Friendly staff and fast service.  Got a good deal on Groupon for oil change.  The only reason they didn't get 5* is a smoker drove the car (to run a fuel injection treatment), and I am trying to air out the smell."
3.5,1,They scratched my car. They seem to not want to take responsibility for the damage the did. Manager Andy said he would get back to me and has yet to. I am so heart broken I was really hoping to find a shop I could trust to bring my 4 vehicles to. My main thing is honesty if you made a mistake just own up to it and fix it. Dont lie about it. I went to the manager after being in absolute tears. HONESTY IS EVERYTHING!
3.5,1,"I bought a Groupon for a full synthetic oil change for $35. The fine print said that there would be an extra charge for disposal and taxes. It also said that some vehicles might cost more. However, the $40-50 more for a 2017 Toyota Corolla does not sound right to me. The attendant told me that the filter used in a Toyota cost double, but even with the Groupon, I would end up paying more than I did at another location without one. I have decided that I will take my vehicle elsewhere and just take a loss on the $35 because I don't trust this place. After reading other reviews here, I might end up with more problems and costs than what I am expecting. Don't fall for their ""deals""."
4.5,1,Less than 1 star if I could do it. Waited 2 weeks to find out the part did not come in to fix the awning on our motorhome. We're outta tomorrow and now we cannot get it fixed. This guy runs a terrible business would not recommend him for anything! Oasis Rv resort should not recommend this man to help campers out. Looks bad for the resort!
4.5,5,"Discount RV Repair showed up on time and fixed our black tank leak in an hour. After months of issues and other repair companies trying in other states, Mark solved the problem for good. And then he came back to check on a propane leak while I was out of town and my family was smelling propane. Mark is reliable, timely and reasonable in his charges. He is a nice guy, too.  Highly recommended."
4.5,5,When we realized we had a cracked water valve on our toilet I contacted him via text. He responded right away and was able to get out the same day. He was able to work quickly and was also very fairly priced and professional. Great service and would recommend him to anyone!!!
4.5,5,Our toilet fill valve exploded the night before we got to Las Vegas. We called when we got in and Mark came right over and had it fixed in just a few minutes. From phone call to finished repair was probably 30 minutes. Great service and reasonably priced.
4.5,5,We were stopping in Vegas for a day and Mark came out to clear a clogged toilet. Making arrangements to have him come to our site was easy.  He fixed the issue quickly and stayed to make sure it wouldn't recur.  We would definitely use him again.
4.5,5,"We have utilized Discount RV a number of times over the past year and have been very satisfied with quality of work and promptness, Would recommend anyone needing repairs. Thank you Mark !! :)"
4.5,5,This is the way service should be given. Our hot water heater check valve broke leaving us with a dribble. We called and Mark showed up on time. The repair was done quickly and professionally. We highly recommend Discount.
5,5,"This is the second time renting from them. If you are on the fence about doing it just do it, it's worth it and makes setting up camp so much easier after a long day of traveling. I took it to Moab and Anza Borrego and didn't regret a single second it was on my truck. The company is easy to communicate with as well! Definitely will be using hem again."
5,5,Amazing family time camping in the teardrop trailer with the Airtop tent. Kids had a blast and we all got good nights sleep in the comfy beds. We will definitely be renting again. The teardrop is setup to make it very convenient. Easy to tow and looks really cool. Company was very easy to work with and staff was very helpful at time of pick-up to go over all the details.
5,5,"I had never thought about renting a trailer to camp in, ever. Then I saw these teardrop trailers and thought, wow, those are cool. But that's way more than I would ever need to camp. Or so I thought.

And then I spent three days and two nights camping with one and that changed my views.

First off, the online reservation and rental form was super easy. I was even able to watch videos on how to use everything in and on the trailer. All very helpful for a camp trailer novice like myself. 

Second, picking up the trailer from Sierra Expeditions in Mesa, AZ was super easy and took much less time than I expected. Wil at Sierra Expeditions gathered some quick details from me and then set about connecting the trailer to my vehicle. I've never connected anything to my vehicle as well as Wil connected the trailer and wiring to it. All wiring secured with zip ties where needed, security chains in place. Absolutely superbly done. I was truly impressed. Wil then explained some specific features of the trailer in more detail and then answered all my questions with expert knowledge of everything I asked about.

Third, towing the trailer was incredibly easy. My vehicle isn't the most powerful but it towed the trailer with ease. Climbing the hills from Phoenix to Payson, it didn't feel like I was towing anything. My vehicle performed virtually the same. The big 35 inch tires and suspension of the trailer ate up all the bumps. When crossing a cattle guard I didn't even feel it when the trailer crossed. I was completely impressed how well and easy it was to tow the SoCal Krawler Teardrop. Wow.

Fourth, as comfortable as my bed at home. Which says a lot. I love my bed at home. The comfort of the mattress surface and having brought my own bed linens (they provide a set if you do need them) and pillows, I slept just as well as I do at home in my own bed as I did in the trailer. Easily there is room for two adults. Exiting and entering the trailer is super easy as there are large locking doors with windows and screens on both sides that make getting in and out easy no matter which side you're on. Open the door, slide your feet out to your waiting flip flops on the fender. The door opens a full 180 degrees and will stay in place when opened all the way. With the roof top fan and sliding windows with screens I stayed perfectly comfortable throughout both nights. The second night I also stayed dry. While my buddies were floating around in their tents on their air mattresses, I was warm and dry with my phone charging in the USB port while listening to the built in stereo. 

Fifth, cooking is easy. While I didn't opt to get the portable refrigerator as I already have one in my vehicle, I found that the location of it was perfect. The ARB 45 quart refrigerator/freezer has held a week of perishable food for me without having to deal with ice or leaky coolers. If you don't have a portable refrigerator/freezer, opting for one is highly recommended, even if it's just to keep the beer cold. Make life easy! I did not use the stove, but I did connect it and test it to see how well it worked. Setup took about 90 seconds and with the propane tank on the side and extra fuel in the storage area under the mattress, you won't be running out of fuel anytime soon. I liked the higher than normal prep surface/counter. I made coffee via French press and Jetboil there each morning and made less of a mess than I usually do at home. Plenty of storage and they provide pots and pans, paper plates, plastic utensils, a cutting board and helpful cooking implements. With plenty of storage room to bring your own if you wish too. There is also a super bright LED at the back that lets you see everything you're preparing and cooking. I liked that the LED had two levels of brightness so when done cooking you can dim it down.

Sixth, messy and wet items have a storage place of their own! A clever metal cage is placed at the front of the trailer that I used for firewood which allowed me to keep my vehicle and the trailer free of those annoying bugs and debris that always falls off the firewood. I also placed a gasoline jerry can inside so I didn't have to carry it in my vehicle or in the trailer. And when packing up to head home, it's the perfect spot to put the soaking wet camp chairs that were rained on overnight so they will dry out.

But probably, the most important thing I can mention here is how much more relaxed I was all weekend. I didn't have to deal with any off the stress of having to unload the tent from the car, find a spot to set it up where there weren't any ant hills or cactus, didn't have to clear away any rocks, I just parked. My camp was setup! Done! And when it was time to go home, toss the chairs in the box and go! Drop off with Wil and done. So easy. So relaxing, so stress free! I would so rent again!

Thanks for making my camping weekend so relaxing and awesome! Exactly what camping SHOULD be. Thank you!"
5,5,"The Teardrop is a great way to explore and camp, and Off The Grid Rentals and Sierra Expeditions make this an easy and fun process anyone can enjoy.  What differentiates their service from others, is how they deal with challenges.  During our trip, we had vehicle problems not associated with the Teardrop, both Off The Grid and Sierra worked with us to make the problems easier to deal with and allow use to change our plans to make the most of our time.  It's hard to find this kind of customer service."
5,5,"Had the teardrop for a 3 day trip along El Camino Del Diablo.  What an amazing way to make the trip even better than I could imagine.  Easy to tow, well equipped, great sleep at night, and best of all, looks awesome!  My first time but NOT my last."
5,5,"This was a bucket list item to go ""off-grid"" for a few days with an off-road trailer. We enjoyed it. Sure nice to not sleep on the ground and having to set up a tent at each new location each night!  The trailer pulled very well behind our SUV. Nice going places other larger on-road trailers couldn't go. Hardly noticed it was there. It was nice having the solar panel to keep the battery charged and the extra storage up front for large items helped free up space in the car. We had several people asks us about it and we gave them ""tours"". All were very impressed!"
5,5,"Awesome experience rooftop tent camping!
Off the grid  rentals were great! They were very helpful with any questions I had.  We will be renting the teardrop trailer and tent next adventure we take."
3,1,"I'm trying to arange a rental out of Las Vegas from September 13 through Sunday, September 16. I have an early flight to catch out of Las Vegas Monday the 17th. I was informed, in no uncertain terms, that they are closed on Sunday and that there is no way for me to drop off the motorhome Sunday evening. It surprises me. I can't believe I am the only one that has this situation where I need to return it Sunday evening. If I were the owner, it would bother me to be turning away business because I made no arrangements for people in my situation to return a vehicle on Sunday.  I am a pilot. Sometimes I land at airports after hours. I pay a call out fee to have someone meet me and service my aircraft, but I've never had anyone tell me sorry, we're're just closed, period. They want my business, and have made arrangements, even after hours, to make sure I get what I need. So, I am amazed at the owners turning down business, instead of trying to make it work someway."
3,1,"Do not rent from this scam company!  Long story short we had a very enjoyable experience renting from this company, until we turned in the vehicle.  If you already have a reservation, take video and pics of the RV (TOP AND BOTTOM) when you sign the initial walkthrough waiver.  They delivered us a damaged vehicle which we didn't see (this was our first RV experience).  Because I didn't see the slight bend on top of the RV during the walkthrough.  They have NO on site security cameras either.  So it's your word against theirs, and because you signed the paper, they're going to charge you anyways.  Total scam.  It's a shame, we really enjoyed our experience up until then..."
3,1,"Long story short we had a very enjoyable experience renting from this company, until we turned in the vehicle.  Take video and pics of the RV (TOP AND BOTTOM) when you sign the initial walkthrough waver.  They delivered us a damaged ladder which we didn't see (this was our first RV experience) and said they were going to charge us $366 for a new one.  All because I didn't see the slight bend during the walkthrough.  They have NO on site security cameras either.  So it's your word against theirs, and because you signed the paper, they're going to charge you anyways.  Total scam.  It's a shame, we really enjoyed our experience up until then...

They now have a D- from the BBB...do not rent from them!"
3,1,Do not rent from this place. If you already have a reservation make sure to take pictures of the entire Rv before you leave. My husband and I didn't notice a dent in the ladder all the way at the top. When we returned the Rv they charged us $366 for the damage. We would pay for something if we DID do the damage but we didn't. Obviously one of their past renters did it or an employee. It's possible no one noticed it bc it's so high up out of sight. Take pictures of everything. Even if there's no damage. We checked their facility and found damage to their roof the same height of the damage on the ladder.
3,4,"I just returned from a rental with Britz, which is the discount arm of Road Bear. I liked a lot about the deal, but in the future, I'd be more inclined to go with Road Bear itself. I should note that I took the vehicle to Burning Man, which is in a class of its own when it comes to RV rentals. 

The good stuff: I was given a 23-foot Coachmen Leprechaun model. It was a pleasure to drive, got 12.7 miles to the gallon (very good for an RV) and had some better-than-expected appointments: an enormous outside storage area that contained a folding table, a good flat-screen TV (though I never used it), a starter-sized dishwashing liquid that lasted the whole trip, high-quality sewer hose attachment, first-aid kit, quality linens, protective net on the cabover bed. The price was a reasonable $4,200 for a 13-day trip.

The bad stuff: Though I was warned about the length and width dimensions of the cabover bed, I wasn't told about the height: It was about two feet, you couldn't sit up at all. That meant to get into and out of it you had to slither like a snake, and you had to slither backwards to get down the ladder. Really not suitable for adults and hard for anybody to make up the bed. 

The two-burner kitchen stove wasn't very big; one burner was much larger than the other, which essentially made it a one-burner stove (a pot big enough to take advantage of the big burner would crowd out the little one). Kitchen-area storage was inadequate, had to use the other areas for food, but there was enough storage space for two people, and since the cab overhead was useless for sleeping, this provided even MORE storage space and necessarily less things to store than the hoped-for 4-person configuration.

Propane wasn't included, so  you had to fill it up, which I was able to do at the campground I stayed at just before returning.

I had to pay a non-refundable $600 at the time of booking (February) and the balance in June, and the minimum booking was 13 days (which wasn't a problem, that's my usual trip). After the balance was paid, it became increasingly nonrefundable.

With Britz, you don't find out how big your vehicle is until you pick it up; it could range from 23 feet to 28; perhaps unsurprisingly, I got the 23.

The worst stuff: Burners were treated like quasi-criminals. Dire warnings about one speck of Playa dust ($500 plus cleaning) late returns ($300 plus the day rate), only way to request an extension was in writing several days before the trip ended (not feasible in northern Nevada).  The airport transfer didn't only included one piece of luggage and two carry-ons; I had 2 pieces. I took Uber instead for $12 and change.

Now, I understand the reluctance to rent to Burners, as I was bringing my vehicle back, a Playa-encrusted unit pulled up alongside me, it was horrible. I make it a point to bring mine back in good shape. Usually, I travel with 2 or 3 other people, and we spend a pleasant day in an RV park with hot springs, cleaning and packing our stuff and eating the leftovers. But I was alone this year, the hot spring was closed for renovations, and it took me two days to get the RV in shape because they expected the exterior and the outside compartments to be clean as well as the interior. Instead of the 8 person-hours it usually takes, it needed about 16, and I had to power-wash the exterior twice to get it in shape. Fortunately, I was careful with the interior while at Burning Man (didn't use the air conditioner at all; no dust was sucked into the unit), so it wasn't terrible, and since they wanted the screens clean, I knew enough to take them all off and put them in a trash bag before reaching Black Rock City. Naturally, I never opened the windows, though I did have the door open a few hours most nights.

When I returned the RV, the fellow who checked me in was ultra-friendly; it turned out he didn't think I'd been to Burning Man, thanks to the relatively good shape in which I returned the vehicle. The guy who checked me out was polite but frosty; he KNEW I was going to Burning Man.

Had I known about the exterior, I would have opted to pay a penalty cleaning rate, but they didn't offer one. It was like ""We dare you to take it to Burning Man and bring it back dirty, we just dare you.""

The price, though reasonable, included a $500 ""holiday charge"" that could otherwise be considered a ""Burning Man penalty,"" which you might think would mitigate the cleaning hysteria.

So, to recap: I got a good price because I was organized enough to book in advance and able to pay up front; the unit was very good for one or two people but would not have worked for four; the company could be a little nicer to Burners; next time, I'll pay a little more for a larger RV (IF the bigger ones come with a reasonable overhead bed) from Road Bear."
3,1,You CHARGE $500 just to rent your RV's for EDC?! That's like a store raising prices on batteries when a hurricane is about to impact. You have no soul! No soup for you......NEXT!!!!
3,1,"Rented a 33' Class D RV from them for trip through national parks with family for 9 days.  Second stop leaving Grand Canyon in morning and the living room slide out would not retract. Called for service, they had nobody and suggested I try and make it to a mechanic in Bryce Canyon 280 miles away. I got the side in and had to jerry rig to keep it from creeping out on highway.  Arrived to Bryce, mechanic there can't service the defective motor on slide out, we are told to try a mechanic in St. George after we leave Zion at end of our 9 day trip!!  We used RV with slide out secured by our own means, when on 3rd day developed a leak somewhere under living room couch, presumable from gray water drain line.

Not enjoyable and quite absurd that such a company would not have arrangements to service their defective RVs when out on the road."
3,5,"My boyfriend and I rented a Road Bear RV for 2 weeks and drove around the Grand Canyon.  After 18 days, I can honestly say that I had 100% no qualms or problems with the RV. We even managed to rent an RV that hadn't even been used yet (we requested it, and they said yes!) On top of that, the staff at Road Bear RV were very friendly, and helpful. I'd recommend them in a heart beat."
3,1,"Absolute rip off!!  Called these clowns to just get a price for an upcoming trip. First off the prices are never the same and fluctuate throughout the year on the same exact motorhome.

I asked for a price for a specific date in September of 2018 and was told a completely insane price of $1200.00 to RENT a motorhome for 4 days!!   I can put a down payment on a used motorhome for less than renting one from these guys and own my own. ABSALUTLEY insane prices and then they change the price due to the time of year??  How about charging the same price year round for the same vehicle kinda like renting a car!  Dumb idea right?

Don't go here. Trust me these guys are scam artists and will rob you blind!!"
3,4,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews. The rental experience was pleasant for the most part and my hubby and I were happy to hear all their rentals are current models. Their website says all of their rentals are no more than 1 year old. We researched some other places and some of their rentals were 10 years old! We're traveling with kids so definitely wanted something reliable.

Research was easy because a lot of their info was online but I made a few calls to their phone line and the service was friendly. A lot of the functionality on their website were not working properly (online booking, early check in) so we had to do some stuff through email and phone which was fine. But they should improve their online experience.

When we went to check in the process was a little slow. The guy helping us was new so it was understandable. However I can see that if it were busy season, the check in process could take a long time. They do paperwork and then give you a tour of the rv and show you all the functions. They were also flexible on the pickup time and let us stop in early to check in. The return process was simple as well. All in all I'd recommend and re rent from road bear!"
3,5,"Rented a 26' RV for our trip to Zion and Bryce. They were a bit disorganized when we arrived but it was Friday afternoon, no doubt the busiest time. When it was our turn they efficiently walked us through the vehicle and its features and got us on our way. The RV was in great condition and looked considerably nicer than many of the Road America models we saw on the road. Had no problems with it during our 6 day rental and they were very accommodating when we asked for a later return time due to our flight schedule."
3,5,"We just got back from our first RV trip. Before we rented with Road Bear i read all about the other rental company's and this one had the best reviews. 
We had had such a great experience, the RV was ready and clean on time, the RV was new,  customer service was excellent. I strongly recommend them and i will sure will use them again.
Thanks for a wonderful experience."
3,5,"We rented an RV from them in March of 2017, and to put it simply, it was as excellent experience! My family had not rented an RV before, so we were all nervous, but the people at Road Bear made the process simple, straightforward and painless. They checked us in and carefully went through the RV with us, explaining all the details of the RV and were happy to go over things until I felt comfortable. The RV was spotless and well maintained. While the weather on our trip was not completely as we had hoped, sleeping in that comfortable RV was a dream! Returning the RV was similarly painless and straightforward - no hidden fees or surprises either! I think we had to pay for our extra generator and propane use at very reasonable rates (I think it totaled less than $25), something they had told us about in advance.

We had such a great experience my family is now sold on renting RV's in the future and we will rent from Road Bear whenever we have the chance!"
3,5,"We rented an RV for 10 days. Was perfect - it was brand new, flawless. They took us to the airport and back, RV was ready for us, I really don't have anything bad to say here!"
3,1,"The check in process was super easy. They allowed us to check in early and the tour of the rv was very informative.   The rv was very clean and plenty of room for my family of 5. At check in we were told we could check out the donated items that other families had left behind. Not much was there... understandable because we were there before other rvs were returned. We then needed to purchase all the essentials. Small grill, charcoal, trash bags, trash can, firewood, griddle, cooler, water, paper towels, pool floats, grilling tools etc. Again all things we expected to purchase but were hoping to ""borrow"" a few things from the donated area. This shelf is meant for families to grab a few essentials that the prior families are unable to fly home with. When we returned our rv we had a ton of items to donate.  All the above items listed and more!  We were just happy to help a few other families start their trip. As we were checking out I saw 2 employees go into the room and remove items we donated. The 1 female employee took a white garbage bag full of items!!  It was done right in front of me. I felt very taken advantage of and was extremely disappointed. Now I understand why the donated items shelf was so bare.  When I told an employee what I saw he was speechless.  Very disappointed."
3,5,Great experience as usual.  Their RVs are always clean and ready to go.  Affordable and the check in and out is efficient. See you next year.
1,1,"Hands down some of the worst customer service I've ever received. I bought a moped through them for school. They said it would be here in 5 days. It arrived on the 5th day but was delivered broken from being severely hit during shipping. They offered me zero compensation. Said I would have to wait an additional week, potentially more because they needed flexibility.... I asked them if I could have a floor model for the same price for all the trouble and the manager replied with ""no"".  I told him I no longer was interested doing business with him and the manger then responded with ""I don't want to do business with you either"". Not only was that insanely rude coming out of their managers mouth... this company consistently pushed me around at their expense. Go to any other sports store but here. They don't deserve your time or money!"
1,1,Worst place ever do not go Jordan is a idiot they don't know nothing about the product they selling bought 3 bikes from them last year with the extended warranty for six months had to take the bikes back after every ride they do not fix the bike properly all they want is your money had to follow my first mind and take it to the tool store in Chicago and that was the best thing I did I live in Wisconsin but the 2.5 hour drive was worth it they said they bike was not worked on properly and they also said madison q9 power sports always f*** things up I just got the bike back from them not even a month ago I spent $180 with them and had to take it to Chicago and spend another $405 to repair my son bike stay away the whole shop are f***ing idiots.Thats my two cents
1,1,"Scratches, poor customer service, and the customer is not right.  Well....away we Yelp!

We got our daughter a new gas powered four wheeler for her birthday this year after years of having a little electric one.  After researching we found what would be the perfect one.   Not too expensive and just the right amount of power (and has a governor).  So, we found the local dealer for this model and it was Q9 Powersports.  So, we take our daughter in and she picked out the color she wanted.   Awesome, we can take it home that night.   Happy daughter!  

So we purchase the four wheeler and they take it to the back to get it tuned up (about 5 minutes after we picked that machine).   We glanced over the machine quickly (probably a mistake to be so fast about it) but we had a baby who was hungry, they were about to close, and we wanted to get home.  About 30 minutes later they let us know it is ready and something that is nice....free helmet with purchase of the four wheeler.

After a very quick overview on how to start it, we loaded it into the truck and were off.  We get home and unload it and notice that the undercarriage has scratches all over it and chipped pain all over as well.  Yes, I should have looked it over more.  I immediately called and left a message asking about a new body or touch up paint or anything.  Seriously, we just bought this and your sales person (who we pointed out a few scuffs on the machine too) did not say a word?  

Three days later I never got a call back so I decided to call again.  I let her know I called before and was wondering why I never got a call back.  ""Well, it was not worth us calling you back.""   Uhhh...really?   I am a customer...even if you are not going to do anything at least call me back.    Well, I explained the situation and she told me we bought it as is and that that.  Really?  Nothing?   Not a ""sorry"" or ""what can we do to help.""   Nope, just an ""it's yours and you should have looked it over better.""   I am sorry but when you buy a car, boat, or any vehicle the dealership does all they can to make sure you have the perfect product.  They obviously did not and did not care that it was not.  As she continued to treat me as a moron and downtalk to me I asked her ""so you are doing nothing about this?  No touch up paint or anything?""   ""No, you bought it as is but I will send you a sticker set.""   WHOOOO HOOOO...stickers!

I am happy with the machine minus the scratches and it is a nice machine. I guess I do not like being treated like a moron and do you blame me?   If I really wanted that I would just sit at home and listen to my wife talk about me (I AM KIDDING...love you baby).   So...welcome to Yelp Q9....1 Star for you and your shitty customer service that would make a brothel in the wild west look good."
3.5,5,Cindy and Joyce have rented our RV out for us for nearly 2 years now. They are very professional and totally screen our renters and run checks on them prior to booking. We have been SO pleased with them! Thank you Cindy and Joyce!!!
3.5,5,"We love renting from Joyce and Cindy at owners rental. They make it easy and affordable to have a lifetime of memories. Not only are they the stunning, but the actual RV owners are just as great. This is our second time renting with owners rental and we'll be back many more times."
3.5,1,"Nothing against Owners Rental of Phoenix as they are just the ""middle man.""  I actually had a great experience the prior two years with the same unit.  However, my experience this year with one of their new owners ended in a nightmare.

When I showed to pick up the 2012 Keystone M-280BH Ultra-Lite Passport 28' with a 12' slide out, I was told that the travel trailer had been sold and that the contract would be with the new owners. The prior owner could have notified me earlier (as I didn't know the new owners) and I should have walked away, but my family was planning on a good camping trip.

We did not have hot water as the electronic ignition was inoperable and non-repairable at a campsite.  Also, the right front jack stand was difficult to put down and even harder to raise.  I nearly strained my back trying to raise it for departure.  Upon return, I reported the problems to the rookie owners who wouldn't return my $500 deposit until inspected the next day (it was dark at the time).  I asked about their maintenance practices and suggested lubrication, among several other helpful recommendations.  As a degreed, licensed, and seasoned mechanical engineer, I should be more qualified to assess the condition of a screw jack.  Nonetheless, I was told the next day that the jack stand failure was my fault; that I must have pulled it while fully down (really??? who does that???).  I was also blamed for something wrong with the table which was never clear regarding the problem. In the end, these rookie owners subtracted $40 from my deposit - not a great way to start a business and foster repeat business.

Given this experience, I will never be back.  Also, there are many other options out there that must have better customer treatment and service.  If you do decide to rent this unit, I highly recommend allowing about two hours to inspect and operate absolutely EVERYTHING.  Failure to do so may shift the maintenance cost of this aging unit over to you!"
4,5,"We have purchased our 3rd Salem travel trailer at Avalon in 6 years. The first was a used bunkhouse to get back into camping. We quickly traded in for a NEW 2014 27RKS enjoyed that for 4 years, then at the 2018 R V show we trade for a 2018 RKS. 
The staff at Avalon is top notch starting with Mike our salesman, who sold us all 3 trailers, Jeff the service manager, who treats us like friends or family, Doug the service write up manager who also treats us great. And the service techs especially Joel and Jay take care in servicing your R V as if it were there own. 
Thanks, Phil and Carolyn Medina Ohio"
4,1,"I purchased a 2016 Salem Villa from Avalon RV in Medina, Ohio on 9/14/2016.  The trailer was delivered by Avalon RV to Holiday Camplands in Andover, Ohio on 9/18/2016.  On delivery, the furnace fuse was blown.  The next day, I purchased a new fuse and attempted to replace.  When the ends of the fuse touched the panel, it immediately sparked and blew. 

I reported the issue to Avalon RV on 9/19/2016 but the service department was closed.  I called again on 9/21/2016.  

I contacted Avalon RV again multiple times on 9/22/2016, but did not receive a return call until 9/24/2016 after I e-mailed the General Manager on 9/23/2016.  On 9/24/2016, the service department informed me that they only service units in a 50-mile radius of their shop. They offered technical assistance over the phone.

On 9/25/2016, I paid out of pocket for a local electrician to troubleshoot the issue.  He found that there are likely two short-circuits in the wiring and possibly a bad electrical board in the furnace compartment.

The product was delivered in this condition, and now the dealership is not only non-responsive, but is refusing to service a product that was damaged upon delivery."
4,5,Could not open door from exterior. Stopped by and was immediately assisted by service department.  The most accommodating RV dealership on our 12th month (30000 mile) travels.  Highly recommend!
4,5,"Took the time to answer all of questions and straight forward pricing.  No hidden fees and ""dealer setup fees"".  Austin showed us our coach and was very knowledgeable, polite, and professional.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone. They kept communication lines open and actually did what they said they were going to do.  Top notch employees that care about the customer makes a world of difference unlike Camping World.  Keep up the good work Avalon!"
4,5,"I can't say enough positive things about Avalon RV Center.  Due to unusual circumstances, our maiden voyage in our Roadtrek CS Adventurous XL had to be a 7700 mile cross country and back trip.  We had no chance to shake down our coach before leaving and found out right away that our generator was not charging our Li-ion batteries properly.  We had to drive 2/3 of the way across the country in 20 degree temps before we could find someplace that would work on our problem on short notice.  That place was Avalon.  They indicated they were slammed with work but agreed to squeeze us in a day after we called.  When we arrived we were met by the service manager (Jeff LoGuidice) personally, along with his top technician (Joel Kent, a guy with 30+ years of experience, all at Avalon).  Joel diagnosed an intermittent charging problem (the toughest kind to suss out) and fixed it in a couple of hours.  We continued on our way with no problems whatsoever afterwards.  All of the people we interacted with were extremely helpful and most personable.  I don't think I've ever gotten better service on anything I've ever purchased.

I contrast Avalon's response to our needs with that of La Mesa RV in Davis, California, where we bought our coach for $152,000.  When we called them to address a number of warranty issues, they initially scheduled our appointment for us that was four months out.  They've had the coach for five weeks now and it's still not ready to be picked up.  And this is for a number of relatively minor issues that they should have been able too fix in a couple of weeks max.

I understand that many RVers encounter frequent problems getting  quality service for their vehicles, particularly when they are on the road.  Normally you get better service where you bought your vehicle, but in our case we got far better service from Avalon, where spent no money, than we did from the place we spent $152,000 buying our coach.  That's backwards!!! I commend Avalon for the great job they did.  Buy from them and I doubt you'll regret it."
4.5,1,I set an appointment to have minor maintenance done on my vehicles and Shane was a complete no show and did not respond to text or call. What a joke!!! Don't call this guy unless you want to be stood up.
4.5,2,"The actual price of the work I had done came in 200% over the quote. I was quoted $250 for a thermostat/radiator replacement and then charged $600. I understand being charged a bit more, but this was excessive. I had 3 other quotes at around 300-400, and my car still doesn't run to boot."
4.5,5,Had 2 busted headlights in the middle of the night and Shane was able to help me! The process for this mobile car repair place went by so smooth and easily. Shane was really nice and made it a very simple repair. Definitely a reliable and friendly car repair place to go to!
4.5,5,"A few weeks ago, we drove from Los Angeles to Vegas and my buddy's SUV died right in the hotel parking lot upon arrival!  While I'm thankful we didn't break down on the road.. this had all the makings of a very stressful & expensive getaway.  In search of a solution, I happened upon an ad for ""Auto Medic Mobile Mechanic.""  ""Great Idea"" I thought, cause it's just what we needed. I also knew that we were in a vulnerable position and at the mercy of the mechanic that arrived. He could easily overcharge us for the 'Kaplootnick' valve we so desperately needed knowing we had very few options that wouldn't cost us the same thing!  When the mechanic Shane arrived, he was personable, knowledgeable  and answered a ton of questions. He ran a quick diagnostics and confirmed what the problem was and gave us our options. Even though he had the part, he even told us where we could pick up the same part if we wanted to try and get a better price. In this day and age this kind of honesty is rare and refreshing. Shane installed the part, guaranteed his work, charged us a fair price and frankly... saved our trip!!  He was so fair and efficient that we forgot all about the car problems. We had a blast while there and drove all the way back to L.A. without a hitch!! So next time before you go to Vegas, stick this guys number in your wallet because if anything goes wrong with your car while you're there, this is the guy you want to show up! Absolutely awesome service!! This guy should be wearing a cape!"
4.5,5,"Great guy, I will be using him for all my service repair vehicles. He just got him self a happy commercial account customer. See you next time buddy. Great job"
4.5,5,Shane is a great dude and very knowledgeable. Looking forward to working with him in the future.
4.5,5,"I absolutely loved this mechanic. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Guarantees his work, fairly priced and explains everything clearly. He did such a great thorough job that I'm having him come back out and work on my other vehicles. I highly recommend this company for your vehicle repair needs."
4.5,5,"Shane was very helpful and prop. Explained everything to me, kept me updated on anymore problems while working on my car. And for a fair price. Highly recommend him for any problem you have on your vehicle."
4.5,5,We use Auto Medic to maintain our fleet and do our oil changes. Shane did a great job and found some issues others had overlooked. They are super fair on pricing and are quick and did a great job! We will be using them for all of our fleet maintenance from now on.  Thanks for the great work Shane.
4.5,5,"I made an appointment for 7am with Shane @Auto Medic. He came on time, replaced my towing harness from 4 pins to 5 pins. Like speedy Gonzales. Keep up the good work."
4.5,5,Shane was absolutely helpful when he gave me a diagnostic for my car. Very friendly and knowledgeable. I will definitely recommend him  to all my friends!
4.5,5,"I had one of the best experiences ever with Them. They came out, and they were prompt , but more important they knew exactly what was wrong i had previously taken it to five other mechanics, and none of them could diagnose the problem. These guys made it look easy, and their bill was very reasonable. They are my go to Mechanic's from now on!!"
4.5,5,This is a great service to use as it is convenient since Shane will come to your home. I have used him twice now on two different cars. Shane is very knowledgeable and the service needed was completed timely. He will keep you up to date on the status of your car and I trust his knowledge of cars as he will walk you through the steps needed to fix your car!
4.5,5,"My name is jasmine this review is for Shane.. my alternator on my es 300 lexus went out on me last night i called over 7 different mobile places and no one pick up or called me back. Shane is the only one you picked up that night gave me a quote put me on the schedule!!!! He came fixed my car the very next morning in and out in about hr and some change, car is running nice and smooth!!!! I was able to make it to work on time still. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! I highly recommend Shane for your car repairs!!!! I just moved to vegas not to long ago and i am glad to now have a mechanic!!"
4.5,5,"AMMM saved the day. My vehicle broke down and Shane had it up and running within minutes. He was quick to respond, professional  and thorough. After running some diagnostics, he was able to inform me of what needed repair and I felt confident and safe driving my vehicle again."
4.5,5,This is the best and most trust worthy mechanic I've met so far while living in Vegas. He doesn't beat around the bush and tells you straight up his opinion and the cost is reasonable! If you're ever stranded and need some assistance I would call this guy he really wants to help! My friends Tahoe wasn't wouldn't start and he drove across town and got it started up right away! Definitely recommend.
4.5,5,"Shane did a Great Job on my 2012 Chevy 3500 Duramax. I had 140000 miles so it was time for all the fluids to be replaced. I had Shane change engine oil/oil filter, fuel filter, air filter, flush radiator/change thermostats, flush power steering, flush brake fluid, change oil in transmission/ transfer case, front and rear axle oil change, and tire rotation. He took the time to do everything the right way, unlike dealerships that just suck fluids out of the reservoirs. He made sure clean fluid was in every system."
4.5,5,"Thank you Shane @  Auto Medic for your  FANTASTIC service! Your a life saver! Terrible time to be broke down on Easter Sunday, so happy we found a trust worthy soul. God bless!!!"

4.5,5,"One thing I hate it car shops/dealerships! I never know what's really wrong until the next day or I don't have my car for a week and the worst is when my car is in the shop for a week! I always end up paying way too much and not to mention the towing to get it there!
I decided to go a different route this time and call Auto Medic Mobile. Shane was at my house within 40 minutes and had the problem fixed within an hour! I had no idea what I would've done and how much I would have to pay if I had to go though a  mechanic shop. He was super personable, very professional and knew exactly what he was doing. Not only will he come meet you anywhere, but he lets you know exactly what the problem is and the cost before he does anything and it's nice to have someone come to you and not pay 80 bucks to have a tow. Plus getting me on the road again within an hour! He did a follow up with me just to make sure everything was still going smoothly. Really personable and caring. Will never go back to a mechanic shop. I paid SO MUCH less and didn't have to wait days for my car to be ready! Thanks Shane!!!!"
4.5,1,Npt open 24/7 as stated. I bought my own clutch cable and spent almost three hours taking the old clutch out and routing the cable how it was previously.

Bad bad company dont use!!!!
4.5,5,"Great guy running a great business doing great work. Fixed my problem at a great price. Recommend to anyone for a quality honest mechanic, mobile or not. 

Give him a shot, I'm sure you won't regret it."
4.5,5,I was very impressed by the knowledge and the amount of work that was done in the two hours they charged me for. They didn't waste any time on getting the job done. I refuse to go to any other mechanic from now on.
4,1,"On October 19th I purchased a 2008 Suzuki DRZ 400SM from Suter's Speed Shop located in Madison, WI. The transaction was personally handled with Steve Suter (the owner of the shop), who simply signed the title and gave it to me, after receiving the cash. At the time of the transaction, I asked if the fluids in the bike were good since it was coming out of storage. Mr. Suter replied, ""yes"". During this transaction I was never given a WI Motorcycle Buyers Guide, asked to sign a purchase agreement for the vehicle, or was given a used vehicle disclosure form. The only tag or information displayed on the vehicle was a tag stating ""08 Suzuki DR-Z 400SM $4995"" . I was given verbal confirmation by the owner, Mr. Suter, that the bike was ready to ride and so I drove it home. 

Due to my current living arrangement I chose to store the bike in a garage approximately 45 minutes away from my primary residence. For this reason, I was not able to thoroughly examine the bike and discover the extent of disrepair that it was in until recently. On October 24th I noticed that the bike had produced a lot of backfire from the exhaust (usually a sign of improper carb jetting) and that many of the spokes were loose (a danger to throwing the wheel out of alignment). I notified Steve Suter via phone on October 27th at 2:37pm, and asked him if the bike had passed mechanical inspection and had been properly tuned after aftermarket products were added to the motorcycle. Steve personally assured me that the bike had been properly adjusted (jetted) by the previous owner, and had passed an inspection by his shop (Suter's Speed Shop). 

On November 6th I thoroughly investigated the bike including the removal all of the plastics and gas tank. I found that the throttle cable had a tendency to remain open and was not closing properly. The front brake reservoir was extremely low, and the rear break fluid was discolored and needed changing. Next I changed the spark plug and found that the motorcycle was running very rich and had not been jetted properly contrary to what I had been told on October 27th. Additionally I found an excess amount of engine oil in the bike (1"" over the maximum fill line). 

Given the combination of low brake fluid, a faulty throttle cable and loose spokes the condition of the bike when purchased from Suter's was not safe to ride. If the brakes were to malfunction and the throttle remain open that could easily cause a deadly crash. The bike was sold to me under the assumption that it had undergone a mechanical inspection and was sold as safe to ride. The information Mr. Suter provided about the bike was fictitious and illustrates blatant negligence in allowing the bike to leave his shop in such condition. 

I called Suter's Speed Shop on November 7th at 10:23am and spoke directly with Mr. Suter. I notified him of the issues that I had found and asked him whether it had been inspected prior to sale. He confirmed again that it was inspected, and that he was unaware that the bike was low on brake fluid. I asked if it was possible to bring the bike back to the shop to have the fluids replaced and for it to have another inspection ensuring it was safe to operate. He replied ""I guess we will give you a good deal on labor"". 


I called the Wisconsin Department of Transportation on Monday 11/9/15, and notified them of my situation. They confirmed that Suter's Speed Shop is in fact a licensed dealer (as listed on google search). Given that they are a licensed dealer and the bike was advertised and sold under the business. Suter's by Wisconsin State Statute 139.04 subsection (6) should have provided a Wisconsin Buyers Guide detailing the inspection of the bike. In addition to the Buyers Guide, Suter's failed to provide a purchase agreement and complete the registration process of the vehicle through the dealership."
4,4,"I've dealt with Suters over the years (and I'm OLD) and have always been treated very nicely and fairly. Sam is the Best on getting you hooked up on parts being either older or newer bikes. Steve is very professional and friendly, as are All of his staff. No matter where I live in the U.S.A. I always reach out to this place whether it be for parts or advice or, if I'm in Madtown, for hands-on repairs/service. You guys/Ladies are TOPS !"
4,5,"A little out of town if you live downtown or in Middleton, but worth the drive for the service. I needed to put some tires on my motorcycle and these guys did it quickly and inexpensively. And they did it right. 
Also, if you work on an older/vintage bike, they have a huge graveyard of bikes in the back. I needed to replace the seat lock on my '73 Honda, and I just went out back and picked around for about 15 minutes, found the exact lock, removed it, and paid about $5 for it. Identical piece would have cost ~$50 on eBay."
4,4,"This place is the quintessential bike salvage yard / shop, and I'd have it no other way. The folks there are helpful and they don't beat around the bush.  They've got two barns full of parts, pretty much anything you need. Sam knows the yard like the back of his hand, and the shop will hook you up with what isn't out in the yard. Prices are decent and the location isn't too far out of the way"
4,5,Big thanks to Steve and Wade brought two custom built  Harley motors up last week. Had both bikes custom mapped on the dynojet 250i (awesome tool wish my shop had one) after several hours of tuning we pulled a 103 HP and 111 TQ  out of the McCutchin Motorsports 103 kit. With very linear torque curve this build will rock any hd on the streets. Thanks for the great tune guys. Second bike was a prowler 106 build that pulled 102 HP and 107TQ we'll be back in spring with some new heads and bigger throttle body (via steves recommendation)  to unleash the full potential of the prowler 106. Thanks guys you rock keep up the good work. Power commanders ROCK !!!!!!
4,4,"As the owner of several older motorcycles, and pretty much being mechanically inclined, Suters has been invaluable to me. Sam, who is pretty much in charge of the bone yard side of Sutter's, knows most every part of every bike you could think of, or that matters at least... 
They keep parts in stock that are hard to find TODAY ( let's be realistic, ever since the Internet came about nothing is hard to find if your little balls have dropped and you can patiently wait for it) and can cut you any gasket you need while you wait. 

The only negative thing is that most of the bikes in the yard have been picked clean, probably by Sam himself, but that's how he makes his money, for what he has in his barn the prices are very fair, a $45 seat from a 33 year old cycle wont be taped up or missing half a hinge."
4.5,5,"We were parked at a friend's house after having driven from California for a visit. After a few days, our five-week old Coleman Mack PS 3 rooftop air conditioner stopped cooling. We went through every diagnostic we could think of (because of a very tight budget), but finally bowed to the reality that we needed to have a professional take a look at it, since South Carolina in July is no place to be without an A/C! James was able to fit us in the next day (a Friday!). Keith was able to diagnose the problem (a sensor that keeps the compressor from freezing), install the new $13 part, and test it, all in only an hour. 
The entire experience at Stratton RV was pleasant: the people were incredibly nice and polite; I highly recommend them for any of your RV repair needs!
Laurie S. from Modesto, California"
4.5,5,"Quality customer service! Authorized Blue Ox Dealer. Had new Jeep set up for towing and new fan and covers installed on motorhome. Owner and staff treat you with respect! Knowledgeable, fair prices, and secured lot for leaving your RV for a few days. Very busy, so you know they are doing something right! Thanks!!"
4.5,3,"Nice people with good knowledge and experience.  In our experience, poor communication and the lack of work being performed in a timely manner is why this is a three star review."
2,1,"Stay away - they cheat!

Friends of us made a tour with a 30' RV from this company and we supported them as interpreter during the pickup as well as during the return of the RV.

The pick-up went smoothly - they show renters a video before the hand-over which explains in detail how to handle the RV and all it's accessories. After the video they walk you through your RV and make notes of all damages. 

The first thing nobody tells you is that the odometer shows miles, even if the RV holds an Alberta license plate (Canada is metric). The RV had round about 70.000 miles (roughly 110.000km) and one of the staff commented this as 'you are lucky to have such a new RV'.

The rental policy states that you have to pay for the cleaning if you do not return the RV cleaned inside and outside. We asked the guy who made the walk-through what was meant by 'clean' and he confirmed that the inside should be swiped and he confirmed that the outside should not show extensive dirt i.e. from driving through mud or on gravelled roads.

At the end of their trip we accompanied our friends again and we met the same guy who handed the RV over to us. The interesting part is that he could not remember what he confirmed about the exterior cleaning. He complained about some 'bugs and dust' and charged for the full exterior cleaning. 

We asked for the manager and waited 30 minutes in the completely empty rental station as we were told 'the manager was busy'. We then started looking for him and found him in his office. The first thing he told us was that he was not informed that someone was waiting for him. Talking about the case he called for the guy who handed us over the RV and the guy lied that he never told us what 5 people have heard!

Our friends walked away paying for the exterior cleaning and with a very bitter 'last day taste' of their first vacation to Canada. This is not the way to make visitors come back!"
2,3,"We rented our first RV for the May long weekend we got a heckuva deal when we called in to book obviously you need a major  credit card but they allowed us to use our friends card as long as she was present which I really appreciated, because my debit Visa and our prepaid visa didn't work! Deposit of $500 which is reasonable, 1,000 000 liability insurance with $1,000 deductible.
They have a variety of Motorhomes up to 30ft, we chose that one because they sleep 7 and only the large ones have a generator.
It was large with microwave, stove shower no oven, Queen in back and 3 double beds.
Personal care kit and bedding all come at extra charge we brought our own stuff!

So when we picked it up service was fast and friendly, we did a walk around but unfortunately we didn't inspect it properly and it came damaged, but we weren't charged but still please look at everything closely inside and out!! Then they seemed to have to repair something or tighten something in bathroom? But again we didn't ask and they didn't test it before we left to make sure it was fixed!!!
Well it apparently wasn't as when we arrived camping using water there was a major leak from back of toilet all over the floor, my husband tried tightening where he could see the leak but nothing. Then a nice worker at the campground came and had a look and used caulking, still no go  we couldn't use water so we called 1 800 number provided, and they couldn't help or send anyone, or even trouble shoot???? We were told to go to nearest RV service place 3 hours away, but in middle of camping?? So we tried talking to a owner of campground and he was so awesome he helped us fix it!! If it wasn't for him our trip was ruined! So pleas pleas if you rent from here just make sure to check, I get things break but I'm sure we left with it already broken and they knew!!!!! They gave us a 2 day refund, and I did like the RV and price, but I am sure surprised at what happened!
We just might buy our own to save the hassle!"
2,1,"DO NOT RENT HERE!!! They are rip off artists......... Rock chipped my rentals windshield,  I phoned them to see if I could repair it, they said they will do it for $60. On return they said the whole windshield had to be replaced. Took $350 from my initial deposit. Terrible service, garbage RV s, also down right criminal. Do your self a favor and rent somewhere else."
2,2,"BEWARE - I rented a 19 ft RV from the Calgary office late Sept 2016. To start with, gas tank was 1/3 full. That was annoying, but minor. What wasn't a minor annoyance was my carbon monoxide detector shrieking me awake at 3AM my first night, 5 hours after starting the gas furnace. I called traveller assistance and reset the detector, then hard reset it by pulling the fuse for 5 minutes, and then settled down for the night. Same thing happened next night (my neighbors were not happy). I called again, options were to 1) buy a new detector and/or 2) buy an electric heater. Of course, I was in Banff over a weekend - no hardware store open. So, I ended up bundling up in my (summer) sleeping bag and waking up from the cold every few hours to run the heater for a few minutes while the fuse for the detector was pulled out (not smart, I know). Possible this was a bad detector, but you can't smell CO, so it seems nutty to ignore it all night long. Probably I was the 1st person to use the furnace this season? You could see a lot of yellow, not blue, flame - so I'm pretty sure that means it wasn't burning properly, and it took hours to alarm - seems like a bad detector would go off right away.
Some observations:
1) This shouldn't happen - a defective furnace leaking carbon monoxide can kill you. This should be maintained/checked before I rent the RV.
2) Why have gas heat? The Cruise Canada RV website doesn't tell you this size RV (19ft) HAS NO GENERATOR! So the furnace (fan) can only run 2 hours on the auxiliary battery - so you HAVE to be hooked up to an electrical outlet at a campsite to run heat overnight. Why not just use an electric heater and avoid the propane/CO issue?

They did knock a day's rental off for my near death experience and several nights of poor sleep, but I wouldn't repeat this adventure."
2,2,"Wow i wish i had read the reviews before we rented here also. We got a motorhome rental for the spring special (which is NO special in the end). They use unfair, sneaky tactics to 'nickel-and dime' extra expenses out of customers. Once they have your credit card number, watch out! They add on extra booking fees which are not clearly stated when you pick-up your vehicle. Also, the van we got was NOT clean and had a very noisy heater/furnace during the night use.  It seemed like the vehicle had not been checked for safety or tuned-up for a Long time!  Upon returning the vehicle, It cost FAR more than they initially quoted me when i booked itl  Go elsewhere - They are crooked thieves"
3.5,1,"The owner of this company advertised a camper van for sale. He changed his story several times. Then when confronted with an actual deposit against the sale, said he did not have the title from the  finance company . The next day he canceled.. Everyone has a right to change their mind, but a business that advertises something for sale and then reneges, is not trustworthy. And he was not in the least apologetic. I would steer clear of this company. There are many other camper rentals around."
3.5,1,"This place is unprofessional and non-responsive. 72 hours after making a reservation my father had some serious medical issues causing me to cancel my trip. Bob had already charged my card for the full trip $2,207 plus $299 deposit to hold the reservation plus another $750 security deposit. Upon canceling Bob would only refund me my $750 security deposit.

He kept $2,506 for holding a reservation for 72 hours then would not respond to my calls or emails trying to work out a compromise. Thanks for making a tough time that much harder Bob. 

If you think there may be the slightest change in your itinerary DO NOT BOOK WITH BOB!"
3.5,5,"My girlfriend and I rented an Edelweiss Campervan in Vegas and drove to Zion National Park for a 4 day trip.  Both Bob and Bill were helpful, and willing to go out of their way to make the experience a positive one.  We had some issues finding the place (hint: The address on the yelp page is correct, but the map is linked to a different address, so make sure NOT to use the yelp map to get directions...grab the address and plug it into a navigator).  We ended up taking a taxi to the wrong place, and Bob helped us find the right place and even reimbursed for the extra taxi ride, which was a relief after a 5 hour flight and what ended up being a 40 minute taxi ride.

The Campervan itself was very clean, and the bedding kit was all we needed as we had a grill, a picnic table, and a fire pit on the campground at Zion.  We ended up getting a parking spot next to a river in our campground, which opened up countless opportunities for ""Living in a van down by the river"" jokes.  We took full advantage :).

The bed, for being a bed in a Campervan, is actually pretty comfortable and we were able to sleep soundly after some tiring hikes.  When we got back to Vegas, Bill drove us to our next stop so we didn't have to take a Taxi, which was great, and probably saved 15-20 bucks.  

All in all, a good experience and great customer service."
3.5,5,"First and foremost, the campervan experience for me was transformational!  My husband and I rented the Two4theRoad for a 10 day trip from Vegas to the 5 Utah National Parks along with Lake Powell and Antelope Canyon in Page, Arizona. Between the National Park campgrounds, BLM lands, State Parks  and National Recreation Areas, not to mention the private RV Parks, we were never at a loss for a beautiful place to stay. Staying in the parks or surrounds at night as the sun set, waking up to that breathtaking scenery, having all the luxuries of home while being camped sometimes miles from civilization with breathtaking views and scenery all around you was the utmost in luxury and the most memorable vacation I have ever had. 
Kathy was responsive and professional and easy to reach during the rental process. The van office was easy to locate and Rick was thorough in showing us how everything worked, providing great tips and suggestions from his personal experience van camping. Having a bathroom and shower with hot water was great when camping on BLM land and boon-docking in remote areas with no facilities. We opted to take the additional propane stove and did the majority of our cooking on that or over the campfires. Having the stove which doubled as a heater was great for cold mornings.  The bed was comfortable enough.  We were always exhausted from hiking. The linens were soft and fresh smelling. We brought an extra down blanket which came in handy as the nights got chilly. 
The van was easy to drive and park. 
Rick was waiting on our return and drove us to the airport in our van which I was sad to leave. I am already planning our next trip to Grand Staircase Escalante!"
3.5,4,"It's funny, our trip sounds a lot like Lura S.'s trip on 10/25/2014. My husband and I also rented a Two4TheRoad from Vegas for a 10-day southern Utah/northern AZ national parks trip at the very end of September. We arrived a bit earlier than planned to pick it up and didn't have to wait. Very personal attention from Diana in the Vegas office. She walked through how to use everything. 

The van was very clean, easy to drive, easy to park even in a regular parking spot, and really roomy up front--lots of space in the driver and passenger area for stuff. And plenty of room for our food in the cabinet and fridge, and our clothes, etc. in the back. We were surprised at how wide the bed actually was--way more room than I thought we'd have. And when we couldn't figure out where the heater was (we thought the AC might also be the heater), Diana was available on the phone, and even prepared to drive out to where we were in Utah if for some reason we couldn't get the heater to work. Talk about service! 

The only issue we had was that we ended up with a little bit of (clean) water seeping into the bottom of the little bathroom. Couldn't figure out where that came from. But we hardly ever needed to use the bathroom anyway, so it wasn't a big deal.

We'd definitely rent one of these again. Oh and Diana drove us to the airport at the end of the trip, too!"
3.5,1,"I have to agree with Matt H.'s review on responsiveness and professionalism. I did not end up booking with Campervan North America because of how difficult it has been to get in touch with anyone who can advise on rental availability, dates and rates. I sent through some different options for my itinerary, mentioning that I was quite flexible based on what they had in store and wanted to explore different options. First, I left a message and sent an email, to which I received no response. After I called again, they told me they would call back within the next half hour, and did not call me back. When I finally spoke to someone else who agreed to help me, they said they would need to check with the owner to see if they could accommodate my request. I still have not heard back, even after following up to request to speak to the owner or anyone directly who could advise on possible options. I would understand if they did not have anything available, but telling me they will get back to me shortly only to then not follow up (several times) while I am waiting to book my flights is unprofessional and inefficient. In comparison, I went online and booked my reservation at escape campervans in the span of 10 minutes, and they confirmed my reservation in less than 24 hours. They also offer a cheaper daily rental rate."
3.5,5,"Why own when you can rent a perfectly maintained Campervan?

We rented a ""Clanhauler"" from Bob's Las Vegas location, and the whole experience was fantastic. Bob is a wonderful host who goes the extra mile--he literally drove us to the airport--to make sure that you have a great trip. Before he hands over the keys, he takes the time to go over all the features and how everything works so you feel confident driving off. The van itself was spotless--it was like we had a brand-new car. We rented the kitchen kit so all we had to bring was sleeping bags, pillows, and towels. Despite its size, the van was easy to drive and maneuver, with a rear-view camera to help with backing up. 

Our family of four had a blast traveling to various desert locations over the course of a week. We cooked dinner every night in the van and appreciated the surprisingly large refrigerator. The benches folded out easily into comfortable beds. It was nice to have the bathroom/shower. After our experience owning a '78 VW bus, this was truly luxury travel. 

I have to say it again--Bob couldn't have been nicer. He accommodated our need to reschedule because of illness, he made sure that we were equipped with those small but critical items like coffee filters, and he even mailed us a lost item that we had left behind in the van. We will be recommending this special way of travel to all our friends. It was a truly memorable family trip."
3.5,5,"This was overall a really great experience and we couldn't be happier!

We rented the Edelweiss from Las Vegas. Having never camped in a camper van but after trip we cannot wait to do it again. The camper van was clean and Bob and the crew were so helpful in setting up times to pickup the van, places where we could get our grocery supplies, campsite recommendations, to even dropping us off at the airport on our way home. We brought our own pillows and blankets but we did use their cooking kit (which had everything) and solar shower. The bed is really comfy and my 6'5'' finance had enough room. 

As newbies we were really sure what we were doing but I spoke with Kathy on the phone and she talked me through what we'd need.

Thanks again Campervan North America- we will be back!"
4.5,5,"A J quickly diagnosed the problem with my furnace, showed up when promised, fixed quick and st a reasonable price."
4.5,5,AJ is awesome. Answered his phone at 8:30pm when EVERY other mobile RV repair didn't. Helped diagnose over the phone and gave a quick temporary fix. Called me back later that night to follow-up and see how the fix went. Then worked me into his busy schedule and came out to the RV park for the permanent fix. Definitely our guy to call for RV repairs in the Phoenix area.
4.5,5,"We contacted another mobile repair service to replace our AC unit under warranty.  They told us they would have our unit replaced within 3 days.  After 3 weeks and the other repair shop holding our replacement unit hostage for some time, AJ was finally able to get our unit.  AJ came out on a Sunday to replace and did so in less than a half hour.  AJ didn't want to charge us a service fee due to all the grief we experienced with other service company (on The Road Again RV Service).   We insisted and he said to just give him some lunch money.  We couldn't believe it!  On a Sunday no less!  We ended up giving him more than his service fee because we were so grateful.  I highly recommend InsideOut Mobile RV Repair.  AJ is prompt, courteous, knowledgeable an professional!"
4.5,5,"A sudden burst of wind blew my awning and bent the arms to the coach over the top of my rv.  I called and he came out to where we were camping.  Looked at the problem,  ordered the parts came back the next day and fixed it without a problem at all.  If you are in the Phoenix area I highly recommend calling him first.   His price were very fair."
4.5,5,"Fast, friendly, and a reasonable cost for repairs.  AJ took care of my fifth wheel brakes and did an inspection of the overall condition of my unit.  Did not try to pressure sell me on other possible repairs.  Being new to the Valley Of The Sun I've now found my repair service."
4.5,5,"Stand up guy, does good work, I will be using him again. Replaced a vent on our travel trailer, isolated and fixed a propane leak. Reasonable price."
4.5,5,"I was planning on fixing the issue myself, but realized, almost immediately, that I was in over my head.  After doing quite a bit of research online I discovered that the majority of the RV repair shops in the Valley had enough bad reviews that I was skeptical about using them.

So, I looked up Mobile RV Repair in Phoenix and InsideOut came up.  Their reviews were positive so I figured I'd give them a try.  Boy am I glad that I did.  I called their number and received a call back within the hour (he was working on someone else's rig).  We quickly decided on a time for him to come to my place - then moments later I realized I'd double booked myself.  AJ (the owner) was very flexible and we re-scheduled.

He gave me a time range that he'd be arriving and showed up exactly within that window.  He immediately got to work on my issue (non-working furnace).  He was professional, personable and efficient.  He VERY quickly solved the problem which, come to find out WAS out of my range.  He also took the time to answer myriad questions about my new purchase.

After he left I had a few more questions, totally unrelated to my furnace - he answered each and every one of them without hesitation.  He helped me solve a few more problems and even gave me advice for heading off future potential others.

I can't say enough about how pleased I am with AJ and InsideOut Mobile RV Service.  The price they charge is fair and he's far more helpful than expected or even necessary.  Any more gushing about how pleased I am with his service will start to look like he paid me off, when in fact, I paid him."
4.5,5,"I'm very happy with inside out repair, I have used this company more than once. Very friendly, reasonable prices and always fixed the problems in a timely manner. Thank you"
4.5,5,"I was very impressed with AJ.  We had an electrical problem, and had no lights.  I must have called 5 or 6 Rv repair services, and they each told me that they had no appointments.  AJ took the time to find out about our problem, and give me a couple suggestion to try while we waited for our service call appointment.  Once he reached our motorhome, he went right to work finding and fixing the problem.  Extremely professional and courteous.  He has reasonable prices, and he is incredibly knowledgeable.  I would definitely call him again!"
4.5,5,Outstanding customer service. They came out to look at my RV AC units. They were super in diagnosing the issue and offered solutions. I'll be back as a customer.
4.5,5,"I've had problems a couple times this year with my motorhome in Surprise, AZ and found most mobile RV service folks are a couple weeks out to get to you.  I called AJ and he responded quickly.  He also has a very busy schedule but is willing to work into the evening if necessary to see you get the help you need.  He is a very nice guy and we are impressed with his knowledge and workmanship and would happily recommend his work to others.  He also prices his work fairly so that is appreciated.  We will call him again when the need arises."
4.5,5,AJ was great. I will use him again if I clog my macerater.. OOPPS.. Great service & great RV tech..
4.5,5,"By far the BEST SERVICE EVER. 

A J is such a Gentleman 

Would not even think about calling anyone else!"
4.5,5,Had them out to pack the bearings on two trailers.  Explained everything to me and even told me what I should expect future repairs to be.  Will have them out again next year.
4.5,5,"I have owned RV's since 2002 and currently own 2. I have had service done by several mobile RV repair companies with average service. I have been using Insidious RV repair now for a couple of years and the Service is out of this world. AJ is alway right on time and goes over and above what it take to get the job done in a timely manor and a fair price and will always look at warranty extended service plans etc.. prior to charging me. Based off of several prior experiences with other shops I will not use any other shop than Insideout RV. AJ and his team are the best. 
Thanks Insideout for always taking care of my repair needs
John Gaines"
4.5,5,"AJ just installed a new inverter for us. Two days later we are at the races and our AC stopped working. He came out to the track on Friday night and installed a new motor. 
I can tell you that there is not another company in the valley that would have responded so quickly and charged what he charged. Super reasonable and responsive.
Thanks again for keeping us in great running order."
4.5,5,AJ is a great RV service tech! Dependable and always there when you need something taken care of right away! Very knowledgeable and great prices! I will use him again and again! Would highly recommend this company to everyone!
4.5,5,Great service and more then fair pricing. Had insideout replace a 20 Ton leveling jack that was very hard to get to.  They worked smart and very well as a team.  I will be using them again for some yearly maintenance as i know I will get a fair price and a top quality job.
4.5,5,"OK, had another RV issue, this time the jack wouldn't work.  Called AJ, he came out and diagnosed the problem, ordered the part and had it installed when promised.  While he was fixing it, I had a friend call and wanted the name of a good RV repair place, and I gave them AJ's number.  I am very happy with the service, and will continue to use Inside Out RV."
4.5,5,"This is an update on Inside Out RV. Just had AJ out again on our RV, can't say enough nice things about him! Be wise and call AJ first!!"
4.5,2,"I contacted AJ to help me finish some electrical work that I had started - it was almost done, but I wanted a professional to make sure it was completed correctly. IMHO, their labor charge was steep and they came in like a whirlwind - I got the sense that they were trying to do everything as fast as possible to maximize their hourly earnings, rather than genuinely making sure they were doing a thorough job.  After they left, I ended up having to call them back to connect three wires they overlooked - one being the grounding wire! That could have been dangerous if I did not have some idea of what to look for and had not double-checked what they had done. Maybe it was an off-day for them, but I really expected higher quality work given all the great reviews. I have other things to complete on my RV, but will be looking elsewhere for help."
4.5,1,"Not sure how to rate this. Had an appointment scheuled with AJ, he never showed up.  No call, no message.  Very disappointed.  :("
4.5,5,Lost my air conditioner in Blythe. Couldn't get it fixed there and found these guys online. AJ was quick and responsive to all of my many questions. He was able to work quickly with my warranty plan and had a unit waiting for me at my next stop. They came earlier than expected which was great -they were very professional about their install. I would highly recommend them for any of your mobile RV needs. Thank you AJ!
4.5,5,"I was getting ready for a camping trip, and needed the generator on my rv repaired.  AJ showed up on the day he said he would and had it running in less than an hour.  He was extremely courteous and helpful.  I will be using him for future repairs, as this was much easier and faster than hauling my rv in to the dealer for service."
4.5,5,"I've had AJ and Inside Out RV work on my RV several times over the past year each time for different reasons. He was always on time, polite, and easy to work with. He brings many years of experience and has always been very detail oriented and fair on pricing. I've even called him with follow up questions and he was happy to walk me through over the phone. If you are looking for great service you can depend on at a good value, look no further."
4.5,5,"AJ responded quickly, was booked up for the next couple of days. Got to us asap and took care of the problem. Would highly recommend this company!!!"
4.5,1,"Sure wish I had had a chance to use AJ and his services. No communication and scheduled 3 appointments that he couldn't make. Sounds like a great guy. Held me up in Phoenix for over a week, so far."
4.5,5,"I have to say that one advantage to doing business with a small business is they know how to do customer service right.  After a small hiccup beyond his control, AJ made things right.  I really appreciate all your help in getting my trailer back up and running.  If you need it fixed, give AJ a call."
4,1,"I needed my holding tanks serviced while I was in Vegas last December and Daisy Fresh had some good reviews so I called and set up an appointment. Robert is a very likable man no doubt! What I didn't like was paying before he told me that he didn't have the equipment needed to clean my gray tanks!  So after the $ I spent with Daisy Fresh, I still had to find someone that could hydro-flush my gray tanks using the most modern methods of going up through the drain tubes. He flushed my black tank by going through the toliet, and after he did this I had problems with my toilet seal leaking.  Because of this I cannot recommend his services."
4,5,"Super impressed with Daisy Fresh!  I called the day before I knew were going to be in Las Vegas.  We were only going to be in town one day and they were able to meet our tight time frame.  Robert showed up on time and was friendly and professional.   After cleaning and sanitizing our black and gray tanks, he took the time to give me a ""recipe"" for on-going maintenance.  Next time I am in Las Vegas, we will definitely call Daisy Fresh again!"
4,5,"Robert from Daisy Fresh is the best! He is very committed to helping RV owners maintain their tanks and was very helpful to me when I had a 'mystery smell' in my trailer that I just couldn't find. he gave me some deodorant that worked like a charm on my sink trap, where the smell was coming from. I highly recommend Daisy Fresh."
4,5,"We were in a BLACK TANK CLOGGED UP FRENZY when I called Rick at Daisy Fresh. He immediately answered the telephone, explained how their service worked, quoted the cost to come out; and then offered to be here in 90 minutes - WOW!!! 

Please note that any professional that works to clean-up feces is not going to be cheap. If you are looking for something under a hundred bucks, you are probably best moving on; as this is a highly specialized field and there's nobody else around to do it. Expect a fair rate for the type of services being performed - think ""Plumber"". I first learned of this service when I saw their truck about a year ago in our RV resort. I snapped a photo of their truck and put it in my phone directory, just in case I ever needed such a service - and boy I am glad I did this.

Daisy Fresh arrived on scene to assess our clog situation; which was way worse than anyone had thought. Yep, we had the dreaded poo pyramid issue - as a result of a black tank gate valve leak; which slowly caused the liquids in our tank to always be low - thus causing the sh*t to literally pile up in the tank for the last 2 months - GROSS! We never even had a clue, nor even an odor issue - and we religiously maintain our black tanks every week.

Rick was polite, professional and thorough in hydro pressure jetting the clog from both the outside and the inside of the toilet. He has all the high powered professional tools to get the job done right! He even freshens up everything with chemicals when he is complete.

If you are in a bad place with a black tank clog issue, and you want it resolved ASAP then call Daisy Fresh right now. Surely you'll be glad that you did; especially knowing that Rick will have your issues under control within a short time once he arrives on scene. They are licensed professionals that know how to get your black tank bank on the road to recovery from minor to severe clogs. Our case was very severe, and Rick blasted through the problem in record time!"
4,5,"Robert took care of the tanks in my RV yesterday and I was very happy with the service. The price is reasonable and the result was great. Robert is very personable and courteous.  He pays particular attention to hygiene, making sure not to contaminate any clean areas as he goes in and out by removing ""outside"" gloves and boots. 

As a bonus, ask him to tell you a little about music!"
4,5,I couldn't believe it when I called this guy and he was at my door two hours later. Prompt and professional courteous service. I would highly recommend this place.
4,2,"Another Rv service that is so over priced. When these Rv services repeat their schpill over and over, they are shoving it down your throat,,,, no listening is going on.  SHOVING A HOSE up the pipes forcibly so the sprayer goes up in the tanks made me feel it could make some damsge. You have to sign a paper releasing him of any problems that may ensue, or even if you have smells that didnt go away...before he started this so. well. Hope for the best for $ 175.00 it should be a nice surprise. But i wasnt sure if the hose was shoved up the clean gray water tank before OR AFTER he did the black tank. ????  He quickly got it done, but then he told  me that I WILL NOW NEED TO  fill my tanks up with Dawn soap & calgon and flush the tanks .... why didnt HE do that- for the price ????  i thought having a SERVICE come and give you Daisy Fresh it means i get Daisy Fresh without any work myself. He SHLEPPED  half of it off on me to do.!! I like to help small buisness people help me. But this was another crappy equipment - dont mind showing it to the customer- get the money for much, and do less for it- kind of buisness. Heck for 2 people a week x 4 weeks =  a nice $1400./ month. He's probably suppplementing his social security check, but come on !! Clean up your act_ its a Daisy Fresh service experience; clean your rig & equipment, your van and give us the full service _ you dump the tanks with calgon & Dawn..... otherwise= the service is only worth $75.00."
4.5,5,These dudes are great!! Bought a 2015 27ft stellar from brad. I can't express how happy I've been with them! They have bent over backwards for me and a friend of mine who also bought there. Clay in service has been nothing but exceptional. If you are buying a camper you need to see these guys first!
4.5,1,"Edit: Complete Crooks. Put $20k into both trucks. One of the owners is a complete cheat. 

Love these guys! True, we bought 2 trucks that have needed lots of $$$ in repairs, but we got a good deal on the trucks in the first place, and these guys have been more than willing to help where they can. They are getting out of the truck selling business, but they still sell toy haulers & trailers. Go see them for a good deal."
4.5,2,"Spent a very long time there looking through many toy haulers this weekend. All of the sales people were busy and couldn't help us so we enlisted the assistance of the cashier to help us find some information about the toy haulers. When we did finally get to speak with a salesperson and finance guy, we ended up feeling dirty and not good enough to purchase anything. So we left and will not return. We had decided to look somewhere new and sort of regret it.  Last time we purchased a toy hauler we sure did not feel this dirty or unworthy. Of well, lesson learned"
4.5,5,"I can't say enough great things about R-W! Just brought our toy hauler in for an issue we were experiencing and Donnie fixed it on the spot---we were in and out! Great guy, very knowledgeable and personable! We purchased our toyhauler through R-W and have had nothing short of excellent service, from Mike, our salesman to Donnie in service. Thank you!!"
4.5,5,"Spent two days looking for a trailer then visited Mike at Rowley White RV. He was knowledgeable, friendly and didn't pressure us (something I can't say about a lot of RV dealers in the same area we visited) 

Couldn't be happier with our new trailer and the service we received 10/10 would buy from again"
4.5,5,This was the best travel trailer buying experience ever. The sales tactic was no pressure. Clay our sales guy was awesome. He answered any questions we had and was available anytime. They fixed everything we wanted fixed before we picked it up. The gentleman that did the walk through was great as well. They are very honest. After we purchased we were talking with my brother in law and he said his neighbor bought his toy hauler from them as well. There customer service is awesome.
4.5,5,"I purchased my trailer - 19 ft toy hauler from the Mesa location and had a very good experience.  All of the salespeople were friendly, honest, quick, and caring.  I recently had service done at the south phoenix location, and I also had the same excellent experience.  We wanted a screen door/zip up window installed in the back door, an additional battery and some balancing jacks.  The whole team from the mechanic to the assistants and cashier were incredibly helpful and they go the extra mile to make sure you are happy.  I'd also like to add that they have the best inventory and prices.  We love our trailer, we shopped many other places before deciding on this company, what a great choice."
4.5,5,"After 6 months of searching, my dad and I picked up a used trailer from Rowley White. It took us 6 months to find what we were looking for. The whole time we were looking, the staff was always kind, and helpful. In all fairness we looked at other dealerships, even private sellers and all of those experiences make us appreciate Rowley White even more. No, pressure sales and everyone there always had a smile on their face. This is what buying an RV should be like!

Thanks!"
4.5,5,"Let me start off by saying we drove out here from Los Angeles and it was well worth it!!! Jed and the whole crew were amazing from start to finish. They were extremely nice, knowledgeable and helpful. The crew made sure we left the lot knowing exactly how to use our new toy. Fantastic team, fantastic prices!"
4.5,2,"My husband and I are in the market for a new toy hauler. We stopped in at Rowley White RV last Saturday and were excited when we saw the inventory they had. The ease of looking at different models was nice, as they were unlocked so we could look with no pressure. 

However, we were there at least an hour, and not one person said hi to us, asked if we needed help or even acknowledged us as we walked by. We saw several employees who walked past us but felt they were ""too busy"" to provide any customer service. 

This all happened at the Mesa location, after looking at their inventory online, and the fact that they carry some of the makes we are looking for, we want to go see a different location but are reluctant as we really felt like no one cared about new customers. 

As we were leaving, already in our car, a man walked up and kind of nodded as if he was saying, ""You guys good?"" And we said Yup! And left. Very disappointed :("
4.5,5,"First off, we would like to thank the crew at Rowley White (Mesa) for their superior customer service.  Never have we experienced such amazing, quality, personal customer service with any other business.

We purchased our toy hauler from them last month and immediately afterward, we took our first trip.  We encountered several issues with our new toy and were not satisfied with many details.  Being such a large purchase, we reached out to Rowley White for some help and they're level of concern, expertise and assistance was outstanding.  I won't go into the details about our ordeal, however, I will say that the crew at this location really aims to ensure the customer is ultimately happy and they go above and beyond to accomplish that.  

We are from Tucson and will not hesitate to drive to Mesa if we ever have a service need.  We highly recommend purchasing from this location!!  You will not be disappointed with the level of knowledge from their sales guys to their service guys.  All around, they really have something special going on and it shows!

Special thanks to Clay for consistently taking the time out to address our questions and concerns and truly showing appreciation in your customers!"
4.5,5,"Don't buy a toy hauler or travel trailer without at least checking them out. I have purchased multiple toy haulers from RW, I worked with Mike and Brad and they were outstanding. When I bought my fist one Mike gave me his cell number and told me to text him if I needed anything. Our first toy hauler ended up being to small for us and after months of research of toy haulers by many different manufacturers from many dealers we finally found the perfect toy hauler for us and again at RW Mesa. I text Mike and gave him the the stock number of the new one and asked him to get me an out the door price. He came back with a price way higher than expected for my trade and a sales price way lower than expected for the new one. I quickly replied done deal thinking they must have made a mistake but nope it was correct. When I showed up I mentioned a few things they stocked that I wanted and they hooked me up with them for a huge discount and installed it all for free. When they were hitching up the toy hauler to my truck the turn signals weren't working and they all helped figure out what was wrong, one guy was checking the toy hauler, another was checking the receiver end of my truck and another was checking under the hood, it ended up being a blown fuse in my truck. They grabbed one from the shop and got me on my way. These guys are the best in the business."
4.5,4,"Zac is the man! He helped my wife and I find the perfect toy hauler for us. He was very patient with us and answered all my questions without any hesitation, even answered me on his day off! He gave us one heck of a deal and made sure we were taken care of before leaving with the trailer that day.  Zac is at the Phoenix location and will definitely go above and beyond for you and making sure your completely comfortable with your purchase."
4.5,5,Awesome staff! Love this place! Dont go anywhere else for your RV needs! Thanks guys!
4.5,5,"I can't say enough amazing things about Rowley White RV!  We just bought a toyhauler from them and our experience was beyond great.  No high pressure sales.  We didn't get bombarded with salesman as soon as we pulled in to the lot.  Its a small, family owned place and it feels like it.  Our salesman James was informative and friendly but didn't try to pressure us into anything.  The whole staff was helpful and answered all our questions.  We bought an amazing used toyhauler and received a wonderful price and financing was really easy.  I would highly recommend Rowley White RV to anyone that's in the market for a new or used camp trailer, RV or motorhome."
4.5,5,Great place for your RV needs! Staff is excellent and will help you with anything you need! Wouldn't go anywhere else!
4.5,5,Bought a 2006 Eclipse Attitude 26 FSAK from Michael Eager. He was great throughout the entire process very friendly and great to work with. Everyone worked together as A team to make my experience A good one. From installing two batteries for me to the walk through and even helping me hook up my new trailer to my truck. First class all the way. I am now a customer for life. Thank you everyone at Rowley White RV.
4.5,5,Two week ago I picked up a surfside2250. This place has the best customer service. No pressure to buy and they make you feel welcomed.
4.5,5,"We just picked up our new 2019 Genesis Vortex 2815 V Toyhauler from Rowley White, what a pleasure doing business with such a amazing dealership, we drove from California to get our trailer, they made everything so simple and paperwork was a breeze, All the Rowley White stores are outstanding, with customer service and sales ! 
Thank you Jarred and David at The N. Phoenix store and the service department at the Mc Dowell location! You guys are the best!

Dave & Michele Willison"
4.5,5,"Bought my coach about 8 months ago and travelled from California to make the purchase.  The buying experience was very easy and no B.S. in regards to getting a deal and negotiating price. 

I've had several RVs and boats over the years and repairs, especially warranty repairs have always been a concern since these things break quite often when new. Always seems like there are lots of bugs to get worked out of these coaches when they are new. Since I live in California the distance was always in the back of my mind in the event a major repair was needed. 

Using the coach the last 8 months I've had some things pop up but the guys at RW have gotten me in to do the repairs very quickly and the turn around time has been amazing. So far I'm very happy with the service and deal that I've gotten.  I would definitely have no issues sending a close friend or family member to RW to buy their next RV. 

To Mike and Donny and all the guys at the Mesa store, thanks for taking my calls and helping me diagnose minor problems over the phone and for getting me into the shop quickly. I very much appreciate it"
4.5,5,"My husband and I have shopped all over the valley for a toy hauler.
We were treated with kindness and respect every time we visited Rowley White.  There was never pressure from anyone in the sales department. They just wanted us to be happy with whatever we ended up with. We finally ended purchasing a 2016 Genesis Supreme from a private owner who originally purchased it from Rowley White in Mesa.  We used Rowley White to purchase and install some accessories we wanted. We also have needed  some parts and repairs for maintenance.  The service department has been more than OUTSTANDING! We are extremely satisfied with this dealership. They have gone the extra mile to help us out!  Thank you Jason and James! Also, a big thank you to Donny, Mike and Brian!"
4,4,"This is our 2nd JUCY rental and we love it! You get everything you need for car camping: sink, fridge, bed, stove, cookware, and utensils. For our trip last October to Zion, we arranged an after hours pick up, and it looks like they were backed up because they were very short-staffed that day. Can't remember his name but the guy who helped us (pictured) was very patient, friendly, efficient, and accommodating! He was working so hard, running around and sweating in the Vegas heat! Definitely went above and beyond. We had a tight schedule, and he was very helpful in getting us out in time. Only recommendation is to provide more support for your staff. While there were some delays at pick-up, drop-off was super easy! I would recommend anyone looking for a car camping adventure leaving Vegas to try them out. Can't wait for our next JUCY adventure!"
4,2,"We loved the concept -- didn't love the experience.   We were disappointed that you have to drive/leave the van running for at least an hour per day to keep the fridge working.  So, if you find a campground you'd like to stay in for a few days, you have to drive around needlessly or leave the engine on, which is wasteful and environmentally unfriendly.  Keep in mind you can't store anything in the penthouse, so any time you need to drive, you have to remove everything, even a flat sleeping bag, so you can secure the top down.  So, keeping the fridge working was a hassle.  We resorted to adding ice.  

The biggest disappointment was that K. in the Las Vegas office charged us a $200 cleaning fee two weeks after we returned the van.  We returned it after hours.  We stayed in a hotel the last night and fully cleaned out the kitchen area.  It occurred to me to take pictures but in our rush to get home, we didn't.  Jucy let the van sit in the lot in hot June heat for two weeks before checking it in, then claimed we left the kitchen ""filthy,"" and charged us $200.  K., whose tone was no longer friendly, could not provide pictures of the ""filth,"" so refunded the $200.  I considered the matter resolved, but maintain that it was unprofessional to charge a customer two weeks after the end of a reservation for something they could not prove.  Generally, if a company wants to make a claim against a customer, it has to be done with in a week, and vice-a-versa.  I could have my entire 2-story house cleaned for $200.  Charging $200 for a tiny kitchen area, which would probably need to be cleaned anyway after sitting unattended for two weeks, and having no photo evidence, is just plain ridiculous and a bad way to treat customers.

We had a fabulous trip in Utah, but the experience with Jucy left us with a bitter taste.  There are other RV rental companies that I will choose next time.  If you choose Jucy, make sure you take pictures if you return after hours."
4,5,"Had a long trip through a hot Utah hitting all the National Parks + Mesa Verde in Colorado.  The van worked great.  According the to the van gas mileage was 18+ and there were no issues with this 2012 Caravan with about 75K miles.  There were 4 of us on the trip (me, wife, 13 and 15 yr old boys) and the kids slept up top while wife and I slept in the van.  We didn't camp in the van every night but for the nights we did things went well.  

The staff in Las Vegas was great.  Friendly folks who helped out with ways to save us money.  Already having a good guess on the mileage for our trip, they suggested the 100 mile a day play instead of unlimited and that saved us quite a bit of money and was the right choice for the trip.  They did a good job going over the van before we left.  The return was smooth, no issues.

A few points... 

Having 4 in the van meant luggage was tight.  There were three ""carry on"" luggage bags and one ""check in"" bag plus about 4 odds and ends shoulder bags.  Because it's a minivan there was the ""Stow and Go"" storage which held two of carry on bags and some of the shoulder bags.  The other luggage was stored on the ""center island"" in the van.  Not to worry, there is room for it all, but just takes a bit to set up and tear down when travelling.   

The Penthouse up top can't hold luggage, unless it's real skinny.  But it can hold the sheets/blankets/pillows/towels Jucy gives you for the trip.  BTW the linens come as a set in a plastic bag, one set per person.  Items we go were clean and perfect for the trip.

Sleeping in the Penthouse worked well for the kids, the big bonus up there was that there is a cigarette lighter outlet up there for charging things and an exhaust fan to help cool things off.  So the kids were loving it up there.  While we didn't encounter any rain it looked like that if it would have rained they would have been dry.  The window screens kept the bugs out too.

Sleeping in the van was a bit challenging because of our trip.  Utah in mid-summer is hot and there are no real heat exhaust options for the van.  You can run the Van AC but you have to turn it off eventually.  There are no screens for any of  the windows either, so the only option is to sleep with the windows open.  This probably only an issue based on where you are camping.  Where we were it was even too hot for the bugs :-)   The bedding was comfortable and it worked fine, it was just a bit hot.

The van had a few cigarette lighter outlets in it so charging phones and such was  simple enough.  I would suggest to anyone using a van like this that if you bring a laptop, get a DC to AC inverter so you can charge those in the van.  There are no 110V outlets in the van.  We had one and it worked out great for us.  Probably want an inverter that is 200 to 400 watts to cover charging a laptop or two.

Since you will likely be in the dark at some point, take a flashlight.  The van doesn't come with one (but inside the van and penthouse there are ample lighting options).  So that walk to the bathroom may be a bit dark if you don't have a light.

The back of the van has a small refrigerated drawer which worked great.  At most we held about 3 1.5L bottles of water, ~5 16 ounce cans, a few yogurts and various other snacks and they fit, but there wasn't much room left.  The van comes with some pots and pans, glasses, plates, utensils which are thoughtfully stowed in the back.  There were two camping stoves which came with the butane.  One stove can come out of the van and go on a table or something and the other is fixed/attached to the van. 

If I remember right the van held ~6 gallons of water.  It comes out into a small sink via a hand pump.  Grey water tank drain in the van worked fine and was simple enough to drain at our last campground dump station.  FYI... for our trip, the water coming out of the pump was pretty warm... swimming pool warm.  All the places we were at ran between 80 and 100 degrees so that's what the water warmed up to.  Because of the warmth of the water I don't know if I would have trusted it for anything but cleaning stuff.  Warm water in a ""tank"" just doesn't give me a good feeling.

The van also came with 4 folding camping chairs.  There is a table that fits in the middle of the van as well.  Even with our luggage this all fit well in the van.  It was tight, but it all fit.  On the outside the van had a table that pulled out of a storage spot between the van body and the Penthouse.

Overall it was a great trip.  We had this van for about 2 weeks and it worked great holding everything we put in it.  There were no issues, the staff was great and you bet we'd rent this van again and again."
4,4,"Our Trailblazer broke down about 100 miles from the Las Vegas office - we called the roadside assistance number and were instructed to get the leak checked out by a local mechanic. But it was quite late, in a very small town, so Jucy sent their own mechanic the next morning, quickly replaced the coolant hose, and we were on our way again! They even reimbursed us for time lost & the inconvenience, and didn't mind that we couldn't return the RV on time due to the issue.

We were so pleased with their communication, eagerness to help, and efficient service. Even despite the vehicle problem, we'd rent from Jucy anytime and highly recommend their RVs for road trips. We had everything we needed - cozy beds, kitchen & dishes, dinner table, etc. Our 10 day Utah/Arizona road trip wouldn't have been the same without the mini RV!"
4,4,"Booking was easy! You can also do an online check-in prior to pick up that made it a faster process once we arrived. It's not the most professional looking office, but the staff were very friendly and helpful through the entire trip! The vehicle was awesome. Beds are not very comfy, but you are sleeping in a van. The roof sleeper was more comfy than inside. It's a full size bed up there! The linens were clean and fresh, pillows were good. Fridge and burners were awesome. We drove from Vegas down through Arizona, through Sedona, up to the Grand Canyon and back to Vegas. 7 day rental, unlimited miles. Decent on gas. It was an absolutely amazing trip. Such a cool experience. See the tips section for some info we learned along the way."
4,5,"The van was well-designed, easy to set up in different configurations, and clean when we picked it up. Bedding and cookware were of good quality and were clean, too. Everything worked well except for a couple of very minor details, such as a missing suction cup on one of the window shades. The person who helped at pickup was efficient and informative. We went to Hoover Dam, Death Valley, and Valley of Fire in the winter and were glad not to have to bring full camping gear with us across the country and to be a little warmer than if we were camping outside. We would certainly do it again."
4,1,"Hate to give Jucy a bad review, but our van broke down on us and really ruined our trip.

A few friends and I rented a Jucy van to drive out to Zion and Bryce. Before leaving the rental location, we noticed the van making a strange noise. I asked a staff member to take a look, and she confirmed the car was just old and that it was fine.

Fast forward 3 days, on our way to a national park, when every alert on our dash lights up and we pull off the state road. We turn the van off, and can't turn it on again. We spent a total of 6 hours waiting for the tow truck and rental car, and completely lost the last two days of our trip.

The most frustrating part is that Jucy has been largely unresponsive. I had to pay for the (expensive) rental car out of pocket, and a week later, haven't yet received a reimbursement. Nor have I received a refund for our lost time that we paid for the rental, nor the safety risk of driving the vehicle. I feel very upset and frustrated by the entire experience.

Although Jucy seems like a great idea, I can't recommend it until they've worked out the kinks in their system, show they're maintaining their vehicles, and take responsibility for their product failing."
4,5,"Jucy is AMAZING. It made our trip through the southwest (Zion, Kenab, the Grand Canyon, and Vegas) so seamless and easy. They really do provide everything you need for a successful camping trip. Customer service is incredible as well--everyone is so friendly and ready to answer any questions. We had absolutely no problems with our van, but the 24/7 roadside assistance is super reassuring. When we returned the van, AJ made the process so easy for us and made double triple sure we were satisfied before we left. I will definitely be renting from Jucy again!"
4,5,"We rented a Jucy van from the Las Vegas office and had a wonderful experience - the rental process was quick and easy, the price was very reasonable, the van was comfortable and fun, and our trip was amazing.  We drove all around the Southwest, and everything went smoothly - until we racked up the top of the ""penthouse"" on a concrete beam.  We were worried, but Nicole Bianchi took care of the matter with no muss, and no fuss.  The cost for repair was, thankfully, very affordable, and everyone was very nice about the whole thing.  Overall, it's a great van, a great deal, and marvelous people to deal with.  Thanks, Nicole.  And thanks, Jucy!"
4,5,"They go above and beyond to serve the customer and these vehicles are such an adventure!
I highly recommend these people and be sure to ask for Kevin."
4,3,"Jucy was significantly cheaper than any of the competing van or rv rental options I looked at before our trip. While I was mostly satisfied with Jucy's product, I would be inclined to try one of the more expensive services next time.
The most positive part of our Jucy van was the fact that van performed generally as advertized (which is saying something). We were able to cook and do dishes, and the van was pretty comfortable to sleep in (the inside is a little short for someone over 6 foot). For us, the Jucy van was much more comfortable than tent camping. 
One of our only disappointments in the van (besides its too-bold paint job) was its inability to drive on unpaved roads. I wasn't planning to take this far into the backcountry, but I had imagined driving to places on dirt roads. The van could probably handle a well-graded dirt road (it's low clearance), but the paperwork you sign at check-out advises you not to take it on any ""unsealed"" roads.
So overall, the van did what it claimed and was pretty comfortable to camp in. Now for the customer service side of the rental experience. Jucy's stated pick-up and drop-off times are not very accommodating (or clear), so if you are thinking this will be like picking up a regular rental car, pay more attention to timing. We arrived at Jucy Las Vegas at 4 p.m. to find the office door locked and no one in the immediate vicinity, which was weird since the website says the location is open until 4:30. To her credit, a customer service agent did eventually appear and do a hurried check out for the van, but for a moment she seemed prepared to leave us out in the cold.
A higher level of customer service overall would have made me feel more at ease with the whole transaction. I was put off by the tone of the agent in the above situation. I was similarly disappointed when I reported that the DVD player was broken and didn't even get a simple acknowledgment.
If you want to spend under $100 per night for a camper van, Jucy is a solid option. If you're willing or able to spend more (or spread the cost), it might be worth it to pay for a higher level of equipment and service than Jucy currently offers."
4,3,"Well, to borrow from the Gin Blossoms, if you don't expect too much, you might not be let down.  The Jucy van concept is outstanding, but the company desperately needs to get it together. We waited close to two hours to pick up our van because they were so badly backlogged with getting returned vans cleaned up and turned around for the next clients. There were a number of things that were broken with the van we had - the zipper on the ""penthouse"" tent was broken, and the pull out shelf for the stove was missing. We didn't realize any of this until we set up camp later that evening. Our DVD player didn't have the correct power adapter, so was useless (but that was no big deal since we wouldn't have used it anyway). Having read reviews about Jucy regarding the overpowering smell of the sheets and the thin blankets, we brought our own bottom sheets and pillow cases and used sleeping bags, which worked out fine. I would recommend a mosquito net (with 3M removeable hooks) if you sleep in the main cabin and want to open the windows for fresh air at night. Lastly, our vehicle had a loud whistle whenever we drove over 35 mph due to (we think) a loose seam on the ""penthouse"" shell when it's closed. We were only driving about 2 1/2 hrs to our destination, but it was annoying. 

With the exception of the stove, the kitchen set up worked well for the two of us. The refrigerator had enough space for storing four days of perishables (just bring a plastic container that can be closed tightly for milk or juice  since the refrigerator is a drawer). The kitchen was well equipped, athough it took us a couple of days to figure out that we needed to pull the silverware tray out to find a hidden compartment with the big knives, spatulas, etc. We also needed to purchase a kitchen towel, a small container of dish soap, and of course consumables such as papertowels and napkins. 

Lastly - a word about the location of the Jucy office in Las Vegas. It's about 20 minutes from McCarren by taxi if the taxi driver knows where he's going. Returning home, give yourself at least an hour for the taxi to show up and drive you back to the airport. We nearly missed our flight. This, of course, was entirely our fault. (Jucy called the taxi company three times for us to ask them to step on it.) 

People stopped us all the time to ask us about the Jucy van and we gave a lot of tours to fellow campgrounders. It is a very cool concept, and we would definintely rent a van like this again. We'll just know better next time. Meanwhile, I really do hope Jucy continues to improve."
4,5,"The Jucy was perfect for our 6 day trip to Zion, Bryce, Capitol reef and Arches. Las vegas branch staff was really nice and helpfull (Thanxs AJ! ), during pickup and return. Had a fantastic experience, will do that again!"
4,4,"Loved the experience of a Jucy! Three day trip in Nevada and had most everything we needed. 

We rented the 4 passenger Jucy with the automatic camper up top. Also rented the bedding & kitchen package. 

Bad news first: 
-the ladder to access the upper camper was NARROW. We were uncomfortable using it although it functioned with no issues. 

-the dishes/pots & pans are too big for the storage space provided. Smaller items would be best. There's no skillet which we didn't know how much we needed it....until we needed it!

-I get cold quick & like extra padding, so needed extra blankets & pillows. 

-no USB port if you need to charge things. Bring an adapter for the cigarette lighter thingamabobber. 

Saving the best for last:

-great on gas

-drawer-type fridge stored 2.5 days of food. Don't forget ice, instant coffee & wine opener

-2 cooking spaces & plenty of fuel

-you'll need a dish towel, pot scrubber & dish soap. It's not provided. Duh!

-plenty of storage & cubby holes for things

-sleeping space best if you're under 6ft. You could make it work though. Grab a snuggle buddy!

-check in/out process was easy (at least in Vegas) & took about an hour total. 


Bottom line.....do it & have fun! Look for Groupons!"

Update--

Thank you for the reply. Perhaps our wires have gotten crossed, as I have called repeatedly over the past week and have been unable to get anyone on the phone, or get much information about my refund. And yes, although you have your own tow service, I was encouraged to arrange my own tow and rental car by your support representative, as the wait time through AAA was shorter than the wait time you offered me through ACA. 

We really did love our Jucy rental until it broke down, so I would be happy to update this review once the refund is settled. 

Looking forward to hearing from you all soon!"
4,4,"Great setup for 2 people for a weeklong trip. Anymore than 2 would be way too crammed to fit gear and bodies and food. Couldn't get the fridge to work properly so used ice- so not much room. Linens very nice and fresh- the blanket left fuzzies all over so it was very obviously new. Had to fix our own flat tire but 24-hr call center was helpful. Pickup and drop off was very easy and friendly staff but place seemed a bit sketchy likely due to new location under construction. Would rent again but would be nice if van was available without the penthouse since we didn't use it. Definitely do unlimited mileage; look for a groupon deal. Oh, and the van is very photogenic..."
4,4,"What a great concept! They take Minivans and rig them with RV equipment for camping.  You've got pretty much everything you need: a small fridge, a gas stove, a sink with running water, cabinets for dishes and utensils, a hydraulic pup tent that you pull out on the roof, and a Video screen with built in USB and DVD player.  The vehicle also supports 4 beds too.  The rental process is fairly simple, after you reserve online and fill out the forms, they take you to he vehicle and explain everything to you and how it works.  It's totally the way to go!
Great idea, I hope they last."
4,1,"stranded in las vegas-rented rv from them and told them when we were coming back and it was in the rental agreement and they charged us to park our car there lot and neglected to tell us they lock the gate and there is no access to the lot after 6 on saturday until 10 on monday morning so we are stranded in vegas and customer service is 0 help and now we have to miss work and get a hotel
for 2 nights absolute nightmare"
4,5,"Awesome camper vans ideal for extended and low maintenance road trip camping. They staff is extremely friendly and helpful, especially Nicole who offered great tips on where to stop and what adventures to go on during our trip. We'll certainly be using them again for our next trip!"
4,5,Thanks to Nicole and my nephew Jason H for my great experience while in Las Vegas will recommend you to everyone I know coming your way.i can't thank you enough
4,5,Great customer service! Nicole and Jim went above and beyond to make our rental enjoyable. Thanks Jucy we had a great trip to the Grand Canyon!
4,5,"Great staff at the Las Vegas JUCY pick-up spot. Kurt gave us a thorough run-down on how to operate all of the bells and whistles of the van, loaded us up with extra blankets to combat the October chill, and sent us on our way. The vans are reliable, and a convenient way to travel around this part of the country, sleeping wherever you find a campsite and pulling out early the next morning without having to break camp. Van comes with 2 burners, a refrigerator (more like an ice-box, keep the stuff you want really cold in the back), pots, plates, cups, can opener, spatula, etc. This is a great option for people who want to drive a smaller vehicle but have the benefits of a large RV."
4,1,"The concept is good and the marketing is fun. But the reality is ...

The ""frig"" is a tiny drawer. Ours didn't work. It took 5 hours to cool down and then froze everything. By the next morning (less than 24 hours after picking up the van) it thawed and all food was ruined. 

Two burners. One can of gas. 

Batteries dead in key fob. 

Dishes provided had old food stuck to them. 

BOTH 12v batteries died every 24 hours and we had to jump start each day. We weren't using lights and the frig wasn't working so not sure why. No jumper cables provided. 

The beds are both too short for average adults to stretch out. 

Cruise control and headlights worked intermittently. 

Pulled mountains at 45 mph waiting for the transmission to shift. 

Because of the modifications? The front seats have zero leg room. Very very uncomfortable ride causing your vacation to start with serious leg and back cramps. 

The ""cleaning fee"" is included according to the reservation agent but when we returned they hit us with a cleaning fee equal to the rental. 

Two hour window of time to pick up the rental between 1-3. Then 2 hour window to return it between 9-11. I guess people just take off work to meet that silly schedule. 

Overall good concept and cheaper than a full RV but next time I will spring for an RV so I don't have to vacation in agony from riding and sleeping curled up in a cramped ball. ... Hey wait if I add in the huge $700 surprise cleaning fee at the end I actually paid the RV price anyway!!! ... Considering I ended up paying for a full priced RV and I'm still in pain from the cramped quarters I got for the large luxurious price I ended up paying ... I had to come back and drop the rating down a star. I'm annoyed and still in too much pain to give any better rating."
4,5,The Jucy Mini RV Trailblazer was perfect for my camping trip! We went to a few places where I was able to hang out upstairs and get an elevated view as well as squeeze in a nap. The 'penthouse' is super easy to set up and the memory foam mattress was super comfortable. The team at Las Vegas was helpful and easily accessible as I could text them. Highly recommend getting one to enhance your next camping experience ;)
4,3,"Well it seemed like a really fun idea and there were some perks, but overall there were a lot of things that didn't work out. Sleeping in the top was nice and comfortable, much better than a tent. My husband and I were very happy up there. We tried to sleep inside the van once when it was supposed to rain. HORRIBLE. don't even bother. Sooo uncomfortable, not enough room, window covers kept falling down. 
As for the table inside the van, we never got to use it because there was a real space issue. If you ever want to use the back area, you'll have to bring almost nothing with you. We just spent the whole time rearranging our stuff to try to utilize the back seat, but there was never room. 
The kitchen was a nice amenity, but we bought a 4 pack of butane that we never even opened and they wouldn't let us return it!!! DON'T buy extra butane. It's a waste of money. One can will go a very, very long way. Also the aux cord they had for sale lasted about 2 days before it started breaking down. Bring your own. Also the tank for the used sink water smells just disgusting so empty it often and when you're not using it plug the sink! 
As for the office, picking up and dropping off takes FOREVER even if there is almost no one there. They only have one or two employees at any given time doing literally everything and I guess their computers are really slow or something. Expect to wait a long, long time, and leave plenty of time if you are trying to catch a flight as cabs might come get you eventually if they get around to it!!!
I mean it was a neat concept and like I said, better than renting a car and sleeping in a tent, but next time we are going to try a RV. It's probably worth the extra money for the shower, toilet, and space."
4,1,"Poor customer service. Used them twice, always an issue. I would save yourself the headache and just rent a car and bring a tent."
4,5,"Super accommodating and helpful!! The people were great and the comradery on the road made the trip even more fun. The van was perfect for our four day adventure to the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, and Zion. It has all of your basic needs for a camping adventure. Will definitely be using this company again!"
4,5,"Rented a Jucy vehicle in Vegas and drove to Zion for a week of hiking and camping. Jucy is great size wise for 2 adults, affordable, good on gas, easy to drive, fun, reliable and very photogenic. The staff was also very friendly, knowledgable and supportive. If you're looking for an easy get up and go comfortable camping trip then I highly recommend Jucy. Check to see if they have a groupon before booking."
4,5,"Just a note about the Las Vegas staff-especially Brandi who was super nice and efficient. The van is the van. We originally planned this trip with four adults. Two bailed out and that was a gift. I've seen these vans in camping areas and watched as five or six people piled out. I'm not sure how they did it. No luggage? Just using as vehicle with some bonuses?. Traveling was fine, but the sleeping was another deal. In order to use the inside bed, most of our stuff had to go outside. This would have been bad if we had camped in areas with bears or other animals that require securing food. Admittedly, I'm not a light packer, but we absolutely used everything we brought. Especially a cooler since the fridge was just a drawer. Using the penthouse is kind of cumbersome. If there is any chance you're going to have to get up in the middle of the night, it's pretty precarious. Also a design flaw with the ladder because you can't open the rear side door of the van on that side when the ladder is extended. Other than that, our van worked well with a few really odd exceptions that didn't repeat on a regular basis, so I will blame that on Dodge and not having anything to do with Jucy.
Thank you, Mike C. for the very comprehensive review of the vans."
4,2,"We rented this RV for our trip through northern Arizona and southern Utah.  We drove through campgrounds of Grand Canyon, Sedona, Page (Lake Powell), Bryce Canyon, and Zion National Park.

Although the concept of using a minivan is sound, there are many unacceptable deficiencies as for the usefulness of this type of camping vehicle.  Our party consisted of three adults.

First the pros:
(1) Since the vehicle is essentially a minivan, anyone can drive it and it is easy to maneuver around the town for shopping and sightseeing.
(2) Gets slightly better gas mileage than truck based RVs.
(3) Better performance in incremental weather due to lower and narrower profile.

Then the cons:
(1) The penthouse mat had hundreds of glass particles and when I tried to brush them off with my hand, I got my fingers, hand and arm cut; I thought they were dust particles at first.  The mat needed a vacuum clean before the RV was rented to us.  The situation was so bad that we needed to pitch a tent to save our limbs and down sleeping bags.  I surmise these particles came off the fiberglass shell of the penthouse roof.
(2) We had the older style penthouse roof that only opened on the one side.  Although the electric opening and closing feature was nice (the engine needs to be turned on however), the 45 degrees opening made the hinged side not only very claustrophobic, but also lacked head room for adults.  In other words, the penthouse will NOT sleep two adults comfortably; the newer manually operated penthouse would probably sleep two adults, however.  Therefore the older style RVs with electrically operated shell that opens to 45 degrees sleeps only three adults COMFORTABLY and NOT four as advertised.
(3) The two cooking stoves provided works well in lower elevations, but is very difficult to heat to a boiling temperature at higher elevation.  The butane gas canisters are retail grade and were not effective in elevations above 6,500 to 7,000 feet.  Furthermore, the ignitor lighter provided was out of fuel and we had to buy another one on the way,
(4) Our RV had an exhaust pipe problem...it rumbled at start and every time we stepped on the gas pedal.
(5) These RVs are very underpowered with all the additional equipment installed on the vehicle after production.  The additional generator to recharge the second battery to power the refrigerator and other electrical items saps so much power from the motor that it is very difficult to keep up with traffic on 75 MPH speed limits in AZ, UT and NV.  On cruise control, it would automatically downshift to second gear on even a slight incline raising the RPMs to over 5,000 RPMs!  The additional loads on these engines are such that the mileage per gallon suffers tremendously.  It didn't help that our RV had over 141,000 miles on the odometer and it drove as if it was not maintained well.  The brakes juddered badly and I suspect the rotors were not changed when the pads were changed last. 
(6) These RVs do not have much storage space for luggages.  Therefore, make sure you pack light if there are more than two adults.  Otherwise you would need to rearrange luggage loading on a daily basis and/or pitch a tent to store your luggages while the interior is setup for dining during incremental weather.
(7) Only the front windows open on these RVs.  Therefore, it is very uncomfortable to sleep in the RV during hot nights.  As for the penthouse, one of the vent window zipper was broken on our RV and it was impossible to get a cross flow of air into the upper sleeping area.  The ventilation fan is there, but is very noisy.
(8) The garish cosmetics of the RVs attract a lot of attention.  We ended up spending quite a bit of time showing RV details to interested onlookers.  Would have liked to be paid for free advertisement.

Overall, I would only recommend this van to people who are young couples (e.g., two adults) and/or are willing to put up with all the deficiencies.  Make sure you request the manually operating penthouse since it will provide more room and since this type is newer the likelihood of having glass particles on the sleeping mat is lower.  Furthermore, request a newer model RV with lower mileage because the company cannot maintain these RVs with regularity apparently since there is so much demand for these RVs.  I was told all the vans are sold out throughout September and early October 2015. We did get $100 plus tax discount when we returned the RV...for our inconveniences."
4,5,"Excellent idea to get away for a few days! AJ and Jason were amazing and very helpful and easy to work with. 

Highly recommended to try them out!"
4,5,Great way to travel. Car rental and hotel in one. Guys at the Las Vegas office were very nice and easy to work with. I would use them again.
4,2,"Everything went according to plan and AJ did a really nice job presenting the car, but after i droped off the car in san francisco, i was dissapointed i wasnt aware of the extra money i had to pay for mileage. Let people know, that they have to pay for a mileage fee as well!"
4,5,"Excellent experience and customer service. They make this easy....... highly recommend. Thanks, Tim!"
4,5,Kevin and Jason were so helpful! They were awesome.. second time coming here and I will sure be back!
4,5,"Just came back from a trip where we rented a JUCY RV to go camping through Zion, Bryce, and the Grand Canyon. 

This is a phenomenal way to go camping, especially as we didn't have to go through the hassle of renting tents, sleeping bags, etc. We basically flew in, picked up the JUCY car, went shopping for groceries and were all set to go camping. The penthouse area was comfortable to sleep in, and cooking was very doable. 

Minor inconveniences: The refrigerator seems to only be able to remain cold for a limited amount of time after the car has been turned off - by the second day of camping in the same spot, the refrigerator was no longer cold. Also, the doors sometimes took a couple of tries before shutting properly.

Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy way to go camping."
4,5,"Jucy was the perfect for the canyon tours, And AJ was so friendly and gave us 100% satisfying customer services. I would recommend Jucy to everyone around me. Thanks JUCY."
4,5,"After being shlepped all over the country and changing planes to get to Vegas it was nice to have good customer service waiting for me in Vegas. Keisha made sure my Jucy was in tip top shape and ensured I had everything I needed to have the best Jucy experience. Thanks to her I'm starting my roadtrip off right!! This is my second time using Jucy, I can tell already I'll be back.

Tips: Jucy has everything. Camping chairs, bedding, COOKWARE- the whole kit and caboodle. This is money well spent. Climb on"
4.5,3,"ViewPoint RV Resort in Arizona  is very well-maintained golf and RV community in Mesa. It caters more towards the prefab home style over 55 and long term RV parking.   The RV park is way in the back of its 2000 unit facility . We opted to park in front of registration  since we were only there for 2 nights. The dog park / walkway was so far away, we had to truck up and drive to the end of the park to walk the dogs. All the staff was very friendly and helpful."
4.5,5,"One day in Sept we decided to downsize.  After several weekends driving from property to property we came upon Viewpoint and kept coming back as it floated to the to of the list.  Not only does it have beautiful landscaping as soon as you enter, it also has the nicest sales team.
Kathy was our first contact and she made me feel like family.  Rebecca showed us the house for 1st tiem and couldn't have more helpful.  Lisana  (?) took over any issues we had adn Vicki reminds us to breath.  thank you all!"
4.5,5,"Very nice park with many, many activities.  Came here for spring training games.  Golf course in excellent condition.  Overall great experience."
3,2,"Buyer beware. I will preface this by saying that I should have inspected the vehicle better before leaving the lot, but I rent a lot of cars and never really think they would send you out with unsafe bald tires. Well Cruise America did just that and we got a flat in a remote, yet paved, area of Death Valley two days later. Their roadside service is nightmare to work with and considers just about any flat to be diver error and hence they want to charge you full to have it changed. ( you cannot change your own tire even on the small ones) Since we were in a remote area this came to $700 plus a lost day of vacation trying to fix this. 

Overall they are not a bad company...big plus for us is they allow you to take a dog, no questions asked..... but you should check out and turn on everything you plan to use before you leave the lot."
3,1,"After returning an RV I rented from Cruise America, they charged me over $800 for damage I didn't do. 

I rented the RV for a long weekend trip with some friends. After we reached our destination, we noticed that the front of the passenger's side couch cushion would slip underneath the steel frame whenever we sat on it. In our initial inspection, no one sat on the couch, so we hadn't noted the issue. It could be pulled back into its proper place and look fine, but it would soon slip underneath again the next time someone sat down. 

When we returned the RV, the front of the cushion was positioned underneath the frame, and the associate conducting the walkthrough asked me what had happened to the couch. I explained the issues with it we'd had, and he seemed to understand. At that point he closed out my contract, refunded the full amount of my deposit I was owed, and we left.

Four days later, there was an additional charge of $811 from Cruise America on my credit card for the complete replacement of the couch. I also received an email with a modified version of my final contract that included a damage fee for the same amount. I called to explain the situation to both the manager at their office and Cruise America's central customer office, but they refused to budge. All we had was our word, so there was nothing we could do. 

Needless to say, I won't be renting from them again."
3,4,"Rented a 19foot for 5 days, to go to Zion. I did all the reservation via email. Pick was smooth. The vehicle was clean ( not spotless, but this is camping.) The drop off was simple, straightforward and quick.  We felt silly driving around in this rolling advertisement, but I have no complaints about the service or the vehicle."
3,1,"Do not rent from these people.  There was no one in the office when I tried to pick up the vehicle, I had to go out into the garage and pull the mechanic out from under a hood, and he had to go find the woman who's supposed to be working.  She did not answer me correctly when I questioned the information on the rental agreement.  When I returned the vehicle there was no one in the office, and only the mechanic was around so I just dropped off the keys.  I was surprised to see on my credit card that they charged me $195 for extras, for which I never signed and to which I did not agree.  Bogus in the extreme."
3,4,"Overall experience with Cruise America for our memorial weekend trip was substantial. Not knowing what to look for in your walk thru-make sure your key works on the side door, check cabinets for loose hinges, remember these RVs get a lot of use and learn the emergency start in case you use up all the battery juice, and start it up to make sure your battery is charged while you are parked and hooked up(if you are). I have to give kudos to Frank, he kept me informed the entire time, he is there before they open and I called him a week prior to secure a time to pick up, he kept me abroad and then instructed me to call again 2 days before. No need to complain about the wait if you are the first one there and you call ahead to reserve a pick up time. I had no issues checking in or checking out and I was there at 8:05 am to be with no lines. Thank you Frank for taking care of your customers! He goes above and beyond his job title."
3,3,"Its ok!! Although we had issues with our first RV  and had to take it back after already being 45 mins away from the location, they were gracious enough to knock of a few bucks that helped go towards our mileage. Another thing is, that the space is quite small if you are ok with small spaces then it wont affect you but myself personally i need a bit more space. I had to use this company as a last resort for burning man, which most places dont let you use their rvs for or they charge through the nose for but if i had more time i would have shopped around!! At the end i got my burning man deposit back and cleaned the shit out of the rv !!"
3,1,"Hi friends! Consider this a PSA: if you're in the middle of planning your summer vacation do not use #Cruiseamerica to rent an RV!! I thought with the stress of moving all of our belongings across the country it would be fun to rent an RV and drive the family out. Made a reservation with Cruise America and gave them my credit card information. Found out a few weeks later my reservation was never processed and the woman I had been working with had been fired, and now they're sold out for my travel times. The ""supervisor"" that I have been working with refuses to take any responsibility and now I'm left high and dry with no RV! #terriblecustomerservice #theysaiditsnottheirproblem"
3,3,"We rented a 30 foot class C over the memorial Weekend to go to lake mead.Picked up on Gibson Road in Vegas.
The unit was in OK condition for a rental with 118,000 miles on it. They keep them relatively clean and ready to go when you pick them up.Good service at the counter and they were on the ball with the paperwork and walk through.
However there are a few things to note.
#1 the toilet is on a pedestal that makes it so your feet barely reach the ground -or not at all if you are under 6' tall.
#2- the grey water holding tank leaked so you had to have it open and draining all of the time.
#3- the AC didn't really seem to adjust to the Low/High settings and ran full time which caused it to freeze up and stop working. Let it thaw and were back in business though.
#4- most of the latches on the cabinets were loose or broken and weren't working very well.
#5- the motor and transmission worked and got us the 20 miles or so needed for the trip but sounded like they were going to blow up. Belts whining, hard shifts, leaky exhaust noise. Definitely would have asked for a different unit if we were going very far."
3,5,"We had an excellent time renting a rv from these people . Alex at the front desk  was super nice and helpful helping us to figure everything out . The rv itself worked good during the time just be prepare to spend gas money if you travel far .prices are fair . 
See you in the summer again !"
3,3,"We just got back from a week in a Cruise America 30ft RV.  The check in process was easy - I called the morning of our pick up day because it was Memorial Day the day prior and was able to get a 1pm appt time.  We showed up at 1 and we're immediately helped by the two girls behind the desk.  They both were very polite and helpful.  The total time took about an hour.  

So the RV - this was a first time experience for us and as the young lady mentioned - this RV had a lot of miles on it. It was very old and very worn.  To be honest I was expecting the worst so I wasn't that surprised. It smelled musty, its was dirty and the paneling was peeling.  We quickly stopped at WalMart where we purchased a plethora of cleaning supplies.  I sprayed bed bug/flea spray and cloroxed the entire rig from top to bottom. I am not a huge clean freak but this needed to be done.  We basically felt like we were staying in sleezy motel for a week.  The good news was it didn't break down and other than needing to put in 7 quarts of oil throughout the trip it ran fine with 120,000+ miles on it. 

The return was equally as easy. We pulled up we did our inspection and we were off in less than 30 minutes.  

Would we rent from CA again - probably not.  I think there are better options for us.  But for what we paid it was fine - nothing amazing just fine."
3,4,"My wife arranged a rental from Cruise America for a Las Vegas to Zion to Bryce to Grand Canyon trip. We watched an orientation video. The lady who helped us was courteous and helpful. The camper they gave us was a 27-footer which had a large baggage compartment. We noticed that our little daughter's feet got dirty when walking around the RV. I suspect they don't take the time to mop the floor before re-renting the vehicle. Perhaps one should bring a mop, a little floor cleaner and a broom. They supply a bucket. 

Upon arriving at camp, we found the stove did not match the one in the video. We needed a separate lighter to start the stove. Fortunately our neighbors in the RV park kindly gave us one to use. Also the water supply hose supplied with the RV leaked badly enough to make it unusable. This was not a major problem, as we just used and refilled the onboard water tank. 

The RV we got had 107K miles on it and was intimidating to drive at first. But one gets the hang of it and learns to be patient.

Upon returning the RV, the Cruise America office looked like the airport at arrival time. They were nice enough to knock a whole day's fee off for the issues with the stove lighter and water supply hose.

Overall I liked renting an RV and would do it again. Cruise America may have older units with more miles on them, but I understand they are significantly cheaper than their competition."
3,3,"Update from my initial review:
Although it took two weeks to get a response from someone, I will say that their customer relations manager Crystal Niccols helped make it right. She credited back one night & extended a gift card for $100. That @ least helped for the inconvenience of dropping it off a day later because we were misinformed."
3,1,"The service is not good, here.  Brusque is the best you can hope for, with these guys.

Corporate isn't any more useful.  The RV they rented me had a non-functioning bathroom door.  When I called for help, their suggestion was that I should fix it for them.  Graciously, they offered not to charge me if my attempt to fix their faulty hardware resulted in any damage.

Driving the unit they gave me was an absolutely miserable experience.  The thing was so rickety that it felt like it was going to fall apart all around me once I got it up to about 50mph.

If you are planning on traveling with small children, prepare yourself for an hellish ordeal.  There's no good place to install a car seat.  There are not latch anchors.  There is not way to install a car seat without taking down the table and the table doesn't fully detach.  So the first car seat you install turns almost all of the seating into something you can ONLY use for a car seat.

A bunch of the little things were not set up correctly or completely missing.  There's a place to stow the table leg and there's supposed to be a cap but my rig didn't have one.

Planning on doing anything at all while a passenger in one of these tin cans?  You better rethink those plans.  There is no viable power source for a laptop while the vehicle is moving.  The 120V outlets only work with the generator on and, according to the staff, you cannot safely run the generator while the vehicle is moving.  Furthermore, even if you could, you need to have a panel up in order to prevent exhaust from entering the truck.  Again, that's according to the staff but I checked by turning it on when the vehicle was stopped with the panel down and I could smell exhaust.

Nothing just works.  You have to constantly switch things on and off in order to do what you need to do.  Want to plug the unit into wall power?  First you've got to complete some checklist of pointless rituals to make sure all the equipment they didn't protect from surges doesn't get fried.  Want to pump some gas?  Better go turn the propane knob off or you might just kill everyone.

Even if you do cast all the spells exactly as specified, there's still no guarantee something will work.  I have yet to get the refrigerator to be cold.  In fact, I have yet to get it to stop generating heat.  I should have brought a pork shoulder because the ""fridge"" would make a great slow cooker.

For what I'm paying, I expect more.  A lot more.  You should, too."
3,4,"We rented our first ever RV for 10 days from Cruise America Las Vegas. We had a great experience. Given stories I've heard from others (both C.A. and other companies) I feared our RV would break down but we had no issues with it. It was definitely well used and we used a screwdriver to give it some TLC tightening doorknobs, etc. but nothing that got in the way of our trip. Couple of tips to save frustration... first, YOU MUST CALL IN ADVANCE TO MAKE A PICK-UP APPOINTMENT! The people who just showed up at 1 pm and learned the next appointment was at 330 or 4 pm were incredibly frustrated, especially on a 115 degree day. C.A. handed out popsicles to the kids which helped! Make your appt in advance and confirm again the day before. We went out on a Saturday and came back on a Monday and both were very busy turnover days. Second, we were pleasantly surprised at the ""free table"" where people coming back from their trip could leave items they no longer needed. With so many people flying out after their rental, there was a lot on this table and we picked up free camping chairs, a grill, lantern, pillows, blankets, some food, etc - all things we'd planned to buy at Walmart, and all things we then passed on to the next RV folks. Kudos to Cruise America for recognizing this need and enabling this sharing to happen."
3,5,"We rented an RV to take to Burning Man. We knew it was a potential horror story before we even showed up. A cute young guy named Jake level-set us on their expectations and made us read (and sign) a special ""Burning Man"" agreement. I asked him what their experience with Burning Man rentals was and his response was ""wrecked."" He then explained how some people just drop the RV off without cleaning it and that it takes hours to make it rentable agin. To those people they charge as much as $1,000 as a cleaning fee. His pragmatic advice was to show we really tried to clean the playa off the RV.

We did really try. In fact, four of us collectively spent about 20 hours trying to clean off the dust. But we knew it wasn't close to perfect. When we dropped it off, a woman did our inspection. (I was hoping for Jake). She was as pragmatic as he was. She pointed out a few areas that needed attention. I got defensive at one point and she cut me off. She said ""I'm not saying you didn't do a good job. Given where you where, this is excellent, but I do need to charge you a bit to make it roadworthy for the next customer"". 

Our extra charge was only $75. We paid it happily.  In a world where some many people try to take advantage of you, I felt the folks in Henderson were fair, balanced and nice to deal with. 

Jake told us he has never been to Burning Man, but he hopes to get there some day. He is welcome to take a bunk in our RV next year, if he can call in sick to work for a few days next August."
3,1,"The van we got was plain horrible.  The vans are not maintained at all.  it shook when it drove, shower head handle fell off, kitchen faucet leaked, etc   The front of the truck smelled like really bad feet that have been playing soccer all day. 

We told them we would be camping and they said RV would keep the heat.  All nights the camper was colder inside than out.  When you turned on the generator for heat it shook the entire van.  So if you want to get up early to get heat in the RV you are guaranteed to wake everyone up."
3,5,"I rented a 25 ft. RV and had a wonderful experience with everyone at the Henderson location. We went to Bryce, Zion and the Arches in a fabulous RV from Cruise America. Jay took my reservation and followed through from beginning to end.  I could not have asked for a more perfect experience. This will be a memory to treasure.
Mary Sue R"
3,4,Our first time renting an RV and this was a good experience. The units were clean and the staff was fairly helpful. I can't rate them 5 stars because I can't say the service was outstanding but they were helpful. I dis not have the bad experience that the precious reviewer had but maybe that was due to the time of year we rented. January I their slow time so that could have been the reason why we had better service.
3,5,This has been the best experience I have ever had with renting and then buying. Susie and Paul are very helpful and know their jobs. These two are exemplary employees.
3,2,major rudeness and I didn't realize they would make you wait 3 hours after your pickup time.. hellooo... get more employees during high season
3,1,"Worst customer service ever. Never book with Cruise America.

I created a reservation and then canceled on the SAME day. The cancelation never went through, and by the time I discovered it (2 months later at the date of my reservation), they never refunded the deposit, as promised. Now it's impossible to get a hold of them to resolve my case. Everyone I speak to directs me to someone else and there is no phone line to contact customer relations (only email).

Avoid at all costs."
3,4,"We took an 8 day trip over spring break and I can honestly say this company exceeded my expectations.

This was our 1st time ever renting an RV and based upon our experience, it won't be the last with this company.

The equipment was well maintained and we did not have any issues.

The check-in process to both get and return the vehicle were simple.

Thank you again for helping make our trip memorable . . .and in a good way!"
3,2,"I would have given them a 5 star rating but after the horrible treatment and lack of customer service during our checkout, it's a stretch to give a 2! 

First of all they double charged our credit card for the deposit fee which we found out during our 8 day trip! That of course was not corrected until the END of our trip. Secondly, the AC worked maybe 60% of the time with very frequent stops to & and from our destinations. With two pets and traveling in desert temps, I'm sure you can imagine how frustrating a hot RV was. Lastly and by far the WORST experience was we were told specifically ""you can drop the RV off on Sunday, park behind us on the side street & there is a key drop off."" So- because we both worked Monday, we drove 45 mins to deliver the sparkling clean RV back only to find THREE other customer looking around frustrated because they too could not find a: a location to leave their RV b: NO KEY drop at all. *The kind female security guard called her manager who said ""I've never known one to exist, sorry!"" 
I then called every 800 number and direct local number for this location & of course got vm which NO one ever returned my call. Cut to Monday when my fiancé drove another 45 mins - having to leave his clients to attempt the drop off & see what level of compassion or service they would extend when they heard our inability to return the RV / keys on Sunday, our CC being charged twice, & lack of AC..... - LOL what a JOKE! The girl said with a blank stare  here is an email for you and  the supervisor isn't on duty."" She further said ""not sure why the security guard told you that, they normally take the keys."" I realize she is on the front lines dealing with the public but she has ZERO care for the customer & essentially was like ""NEXT!"" --- Spend $1800 & get treated  like crap. No thanks"
3,1,"We've rented from other RV rentals before and this is by far the worst experience we've had. The RV we got was falling apart, the waste was still full, tires were balding, customer service rude. If we weren't crunched for time, we would've walked away and rented elsewhere. We would not recommend renting from Cruise America in the Las Vegas location at least."
3,5,"GREAT experience! Staff were friendly, and good personalities! Our family camping trip was a HUGE success! Thank you Cruise America!!!!  OH! My brother got his USB charger stuck in the cigarette lighter... The guy was able to get it out... Best attitude! Thx"
3,1,I understand that when you rent from them everyone else beats him up and treats him like krapp and blah blah blah but come on as fast as a push a man and push him back out have some decency to clean and maintain them and keep them running
3,3,"This was a firist experience renting an RV for a trip to the Grand Canyon. We rented a 30ft RV for the trip. The customer service at this location isn't the best. There was an hour wait just to pick up the RV. The RV itself was clean and roomy. You can't run the cabin AC , use the microwave and electrical outlets without running generator. Room to sleep eight people,  fridge, freezer, stove top."
3,5,"One of traditions is going RVing on Christmas or Thanksgiving! I have rented here twice. The first time we went with the compact it was a great choice since it was our first time ever renting and driving an RV. We had zero problems going to the Grand Canyon and overall it was a very memorable and fun trip. The next time we went to Death Valley we opted for the standard size. It actually was almost the same price as the compact but I enjoyed the fact it had a dedicated bed in it which made for a more comfortable sleeping environment for me since I am 6-3. It was incredibly easy to drive and after you get on the road for about 5 minutes the large vehicle jitters meltaway. Be careful though because if you rent one of these things you will get the RV fever and then before you know it you'll be $100,000 in debt you've been warned!!!"
3,5,rented a 25' rv ...and from  reservation to pick up to rv return everything was perfect....we picked up a clean and ready to go rv.we took our dogs with us spent some time cleaning up and returned  as we  received it ..got deposit back smooth painless transaction...i would recomend this to any one...and if your thinking of purchasing one ...what better way to see if the size you want is really the size you need..very pleased
3,5,"We recently bought a used RV from Cruise America and it was one of the most impressive experiences I have ever had with a company.  The vehicle is in phenomenal condition, priced very competitively and comes with a 30 day (door to door)/ 1 year (engine and powertrain) warranty.  Paul Larsen guided us through the entire purchase and told us to call him if we had any issues.  We contacted him after having two minor issues, within thirty days, and he not only quickly diagnosed the problems but provided the path for their resolution.  Antonio, the service manager in Arizona, was also incredibly knowledgable and helped us resolve our issues quickly.  It can be incredibly rare to find such excellent customer service and knowledgeable support from a dealer much less a rental company selling it's used inventory.  This speaks very highly of the company as a whole.  I look forward to sharing my experience with anyone that would like to rent or buy an RV.  Cruise America is the platinum standard for customer service and efficacy."
3,5,"Very friendly staff, easy and smooth process, got our deposit back no problem and RV was nice just minor wear and tear."
3,5,"Rented the compact RV for 4 days and it was great. All of the yelp reviews definitely give no justice to the ease of my rental. Do your research, read the fine print, and you'll be fine. The rv was just what we needed, simple to operate, fairly easy to drive, and the staff was nice and helpful. Even their roadside assistance agent answered and helped me with all of my troubleshooting. Definitely would rent from them again."
3,3,"Ok...Here's Maddi again with the review.  Only a three, it was a four at first, BUT no.  Just a three spot will do...

This time it's Cruise America in Henderson.  Now, this is my VERY FIRST TIME renting a RV, so naturally I would be scared and asking a million and one questions.  Good thing my bff is an expert so he knows the ins and outs  We were greeted (which was a plus!) I really need to start remembering names so that when they read the reviews, they know!!! Anyway, the rental sales agent went through the inspection rather quickly, BUT THOROUGH.  

My friends and I went to Pahranagat Lake for the week. Enjoyed it!  Now, when returning to the city and when it comes to information, I really don't like to be lied to.  The rental sales agent told us that we could dump for ""free"" at Sam's Town...FAIL.  For $30 plus a night you can dump, That's not ""free"".  Good thing I had my phone and started to search places, there was one place that was free, BUT when we got there, they claim not to have the key to assist us in dumping.  It's the exit before you get to Apex Valero gas station.  Motor speedway exit.  Maybe it was because it was 1AM.  And you know how people are especially in Vegas, they don't want to do anything UNLESS they have to...UGHHHH. 

We ended up dumping at Oasis RV park for $15.  We returned the RV on February 28th.  Cleaned the HECK out of the RV, we did a waayyy better job than the employees did.  haha!  I received my refund plus a little extra because I bought too much gas!!!!! UGHHHH.  My dumb butt filled up the tank because I was thinking it was like a car...oh well I was out like 80 something dollars...trial and error.  I know for next time...

--Maddi"
3,4,"Check in process was really simple. This was my first RV rental so I wasn't sure about the size I needed. The employee took the time to show us various sizes and walk me through the process of using any items inside of the RV. 

I was pleased with how simple everything was. They come equipped with pretty much everything you need. Stoves, showers, heating and air conditioning. The refrigerator is larger then you get at most hotels. I rented the standard 25 ft RV. It had plenty of space to accommodate a family of 4."
3,1,"Arrived at the pickup location at 1120 am to pick up. I had to sit and wait for over four hours before they had the RV ready. Zero communication, flat out rude service. We are excited about our adventure but it's not starting off so well...."
3,1,"I can't begin to describe how unprofessional and incompetent these people are.  Actually just heard the guy say to a co-worker ""I love when these people think we should hurry.""  Why exactly do I schedule a reservation pickup time when its first come first serve?  The RV's are ok, the prices are decent, but be prepared for a 3hr wait and absolutely shitty service."
3,5,"We rented an RV in California and left it here before flying home. I thought the young woman at the desk was wonderful, personable, and helpful. Five stars for how easy it was to work with her. It left a good final impression."
3,3,"So far no good.
We rented this think months in advance. When we called the day prior to get pickup time they set us at 130pm! This caused us to lose our first campsite reservation and the kids first day of their trip! 
When I called to see if I could come in early they said no only my reserved time. I get to the facility and 3 families are allowed to check in in front of me with no appointment time. Needless to say I stood in line an additional hour before I was taken care of!
Update 
Ok, so I originally had given them 1 star due to my pickup experience. However the rest of the trip went trouble free and the rv ran fine. 
The turn in was fine, took less than 30 minutes and Frank was a huge help at the end of the pickup and at turn in. In spite of the little trouble with my pickup Frank is a huge asset to this place! He's thorough and fast!
Thanks for the help!"
3,3,"This was a very disappointing experience. What seemed like a good deal, turned into a nightmare. 
We always go camping at near by sand dunes, on the last weekend of October. Our group rented a total of 5 RV's.  Of the 5, 1 was rented from the competition. We chose Cruise America because it was a lower deposit, and a little less expensive. 
Of the 4 RV's, 3 had generator problems. All 4 were unacceptable for rental. There were various problems... However, the Generator seemed to be the biggest issue. 
Aside from the generator, we had many issues with our RV! We had a broken vent, I had to fix many fixtures that were falling apart,  the shower was disgusting and had to be cleaned, and the stereo had issues. 
The reason I'm giving them 3 Stars instead of 1, is because every employee we encountered, especially the call center guy were very helpful, courteous, and friendly."
3,1,"The mansion on wheels turned out to be a nightmare on wheels. We ended up with no air (it was 102). Oh, and the toilet didn't work. We called and they said a plumber would come...he didn't. After filling the water, it was gone in one small dishwashing and two flushes. As a first camping experience made it possibly my last. When we returned it my husband ask to speak to the manager he wasn't there, we were told he'd call us. He must not have ever come back."
3,1,"This is literally the worst customer service that you can experience

- the staff is under educated 
- they don't care at all 
- showed up for an 1pm appointment didn't even get a vehicle until 3  pm 
- paid for full propane wasn't filled  , paid for full gas it was at 3/4th tank 
- complain that generator is too hot 


if you are not desperate and going to burning man i would stay very far away from this"
3,1,"First the Cruise America pros; the blackout curtains with Velcro work well.

Neutral reviews for Cruise America; Everyone we had contact with was very pleasant but it rarely resulted in positive solutions.

Cruise America (CA) cons; MAINTENANCE! Four of us were sent out in a 2016 rattletrap 30 foot unit from the Las Vegas rental in October 2018 with a bald front driver side tire which was down to the cord showing. On day 2 we found the engine 1.5 quarts low on oil. (The RV never required more oil for the remainder of the 2 weeks we drove 1600 miles.) The first night we discovered the gas heater did not work which forced our first contact with CA road service. CA sent a sub contractor to our campsite in Sedona to fix the heater, which he was able to get to work. He also found the bald tire, a loose cabinet holding the microwave and stove hood, bath sink faucet un-attached (not repairable) and a burnt wire on a ceiling light along with other more minor problems. He stated he would let CA know about the bald tire and arrange for replacement. We called CA the following morning to find out when the tire repair would be done as we wanted to move on and they had no idea what I was talking about. But they did order a repair, which cost us 3 daylight hours of our vacation waiting. The tire was replaced by noon and the 5 other tires were inspected and found to all be low on air.

Over the next few nights we continually had issues with the heater, which required several more calls to CA. We were told to buy an electric heater and would be reimbursed. Problem was they gave us directions to a couple of Walmart's that were nowhere near our location (100 plus miles) or not along our planned route. As we were in the southern Utah mountains there were no other places to buy a heater. We did find ourselves in a RV park close to a CA sub-contractor who determined the coils in the gas valve needed to be replaced, the heater would work when it was warm but not when the temps were cold, of course. He did not have the parts and we were back on the road but went some distance out of our way to buy a heater costing us miles, which we had to pay for.

Conclusion; BALD TIRES ON A RV ARE UNSAFE AND UNACCEPTABLE!! CA should be ashamed of themselves not maintaining their rental units to a safe level.  It appears CA would rather have units rented and on the road then lose money with them idle and down for repair. This way they can have the renter idle waiting for repairs on the road costing them valuable vacation time. 

At the RV turn in we were meagerly compensated for our issues, troubles and time consumed. We informed them the ""engine light"" came on and was told it happens and to be concerned only if the ""wrench light"" came on. CA's business model does not offer slide-outs, awnings or other common things found on a RV. While I have no experience with ElMonte RV or Road Bear RV my recommendation would be to go with another RV rental company that offers more for your money and is popular as we saw many of their units on the road."
3,1,"One of the most poorly organized pickup experiences I have ever experienced.   There was a full lobby of people waiting to get their RVs and they were not ready.  They said that you had to call 24 hours in advance to get a pick up time and we did, twice.  We called the day before and again that morning to confirm.  Once we got there, our RV was still not ready.  The customers were the ones making suggestions that maybe we should watch the video so that their were not time being wasted instead of the staff suggesting that.  It was very poorly run with a huge lack of management and customer service."
3,1,"I reserved our RV almost 3 months in advance. I recieved an email the day before saying we needed to call to schedule pick up. I called at 8:30 am and was told I could pick up at 3pm the next day... Their website says 11am pick up. So the day of the reservation I called 3 times to try to get a earlier pick up so it didn't disrupt our vacation to much. I was finally told we could pick by about 1pm. Not so much the complaint but just a hassle setting up behind schedule.

When we showed up the line moved fast. As the man walked us to the RV he asked if we ever drove one before. We said yes. He walked around in outside and noted a rock chip and the dented bumper. He then handed us our keys. My boyfriend said shouldn't we check out the inside? The man said its just wear and tear. We decided to take a look and noticed it was not very clean and smelled horrible. The man just said see wear and tear. We went ahead and opened all the windows to air it out and set out on our adventure.

When we arrived at our campsite we clean up the RV and unpacked. A couple hours late we noticed a leak and a smell coming from the out put side of the RV... After getting under the RV we found out the output lines were duct taped. We informed by the campsite person that we could not use our waters or we would be asked to leave because of the leak.

When we returned the RV and explained what happened we were told you should never hook up at a RV site... that's it. Mind you the leak was before we hooked up. No apology no credit for renting a $700 tent... I am very disappointed and will take our business else where."
3.5,1,"I am a first time pop-up camper owner.  Took in a second hand unit that I had bought.  It felt as if the refridgerator was not working properly.  They called me the next day and said it was opperating properly.  And that it will not cool down too far, 60 degrees is good from what they said, since the valley is so hot.  So for that I was charged $120.  Felt it was advice that could have been issued over the phone.  Instead, I feel they did nothing and I paid the price."
3.5,5,"We were having troubles with our on board generator and after contacting the original place that did work on it and basically told us too bad, we contacted East Valley RV Specialists, via phone. Not only was the gentlemen on the phone friendly, but he gave advice on what the issue could be and how to fix it. And within 5 minutes we had the generator running again! He could have easily done like the other company and tools us to haul the RV in and charge us for it. We really appreciate taking the time to answer our question on the phone and helping."
3.5,5,We just picked up our Allegro Bus from East Valley RV Specialists after them having it for 2 weeks for some major repairs. We were only passing through Arizona when we made an appointment to have some issues looked at that turned major. They were always professional & curteous to work with & get our work done all as promised. Kevin especially was always prompt & thorough every time we needed to discuss anything. VERY happy with the outcome. Highly recommend East Valley RV Specialists.
3.5,5,"We've come a long way since we first purchased new dash air. Let me first set the scene: We have a 1991 Foretravel, U-225. Besides the dash air there were other issues to be repaired each time we came back with dash air problems so there was money being spent. 8 returns for the dash air. Each time they could recharged the system and test it, it would perform flawlessly. One time it failed 10 minutes after leaving the shop. Well, they did not give up and this visit they discovered the leak. It was a bad crimp in low side hose where it ran above the battery compartment. It was not their crimp and yet they did not charge me for the work.

Prior to this visit we went to San Diego and Anaheim for 12 days. I had just picked the rv up from Cummins Red Mountain and was dieseling up when I thought the ac compressor locked up causing the belt to squeal. I cut the ac belt and returned to EVRV where they discovered Cummins had installed the wrong belt. Not their issue and still they made the repairs and got me on the road. Do I love these folks? Yes!"
3.5,5,This is our second experience with E. V. R. V. Repair. We had some body damage caused by another party repaired here. E. V. R. V. were quite helpful and did a great job repairing the damage. Thank you John Niederhauser and the whole repair team!
3.5,1,"These guys are the worst. Took my first travel trailer in for tire inspection. Was told they were all ok and ""Safe"" for travel. I was concerned because tread was good but DOT dates were older. My buddy who sells tires said they were not good so being new at this trailer stuff, I took trailer in for reinspection. Again was told not to worry. To be safe on my own and against the dealers advice was able to replace three of the 4 tires and thought I was ok, especially with EV RVs seal of approval. I got about 20 miles outside of Gila Bend on two lane highway when only tire I didn't replace blew. Don't listen to these guys, at least when it comes to tires. They don't know what they're talking about."
3.5,1,"We took our RV in for slide adjustments on one slide that was rubbing on the new floor I had just had installed at another place, they came back and stated that others needed to be adjusted... so now I am out $1300, and the slides rub more now than they ever did before, and there are metal shavings on the floors that scrape the new flooring. 
So I will have to take to someone else that hopefully can fix what this place made worse! it is ruining my new flooring"
3.5,5,"They offered same day service, came to me, and the tech was very thorough.  I am thrilled with the service we received!"
3.5,5,"I have never experienced a caring and competent RV business until I started doing business with EV RV specialists. Jeremy, Tommy and Frank have worked through all of my problems with my RV after it has sat in AZ for 9 years. At one point, Jeremy and his tech Tommy came to my RV site to do a repair because I was not able to drive it. I am forever grateful for the time, expertise and compassion from this business and the help to get me on the road. Thank you!"
3.5,2,"They treat me right when I use them for repairs and are great at dealing with my warranty company. I  had them un-fog a window for me and the outside vendor they used did a CRAP job. My window now whistles in the wind and the they left metal shavings all over the console in my 250k motor-home!
I did complain to the shop mgr. and he wasn't interested in making it right and said I should put some caulk around the frame! ? Why did I pay to have it fixed only to finish the job myself?"
3.5,5,"Our coach: 1991 Foretravel, U225, 36', Foretravel proprietary chassis, 5.9 Cummins.
Our story: An old coach for sure. We bought from the owner of a small trucking company who did his own maintenance. We quickly learned it was poor maintenance at best and spent a lot of money over 3 years bringing it up to date.
This should not be taken as anything other than a glowing review of East Valley RV Specialists and its employees as I review their work through 2 intervals of 2014 and 2015. But the story begins in 2012. It started when my wife's ex husband (also family friend) developed leukemia and needed help. We arrived in Phoenix in August and with our rv parked in the street in front of the house for 8 weeks, drove him to treatments preparing for a bone marrow transplant. We went to Seattle for 5 months for transplantation, returning to Phoenix the next February, 2013 with the rv parked in the street for 7 weeks.. Home that October, we thought he would recover fully. February of 2014 brought a recurrence of the disease. Now terminal we returned to Phoenix immediately expecting him to die in 12 weeks. We arrived to find he was again on chemo to give him as much time as possible. Responding to the chemo, we decided to travel the southwest. We needed new dash air.
We went to East Valley RV Specialists for a full service and dash air. They checked the coach over and found several things wrong. They did the air, charging system repair and a number of smaller tasks. OK, we're ready to travel? No. The forward roof ac quit. I called a mobile guy on Friday and he was there on Monday and replaced the ac in the street.  On the road to the Grand Canyon, Page and Kanab we had air. On the return into the valley the air quit. Returning to EVRV  they found a leak and quickly had me on the road. Again it quit. No problem, I needed other work done, they could have for a couple weeks. The third visit I thought they had it. Now late in September we were headed back home as our patient was responding to the chemo and his cousin would winter in Phoenix and carry on with his care.
April, 2015 were preparing to go to Branson, MO and Hot Springs, AR with plans of returning to Phoenix in June. Getting ready for Branson as I was backing into the driveway I heard a noise. I discovered a 6"" bolt backed out of the alternator and destroyed the fan. The alternator had been replaced by EVRV. My brother and I replaced the fan and we were ready to go. The dash air was not working and on the return to Phoenix issues developed with the generator, HWH and, after having engine work done on the fuel pump and power steering pump before we hit the road, the low side hose came completely off the ac compressor.
Happy to see me? They were quick to get me in and had the dash air going again. We were all very enthusiastic as they had it charged, were driving it for several days and it was performing perfectly!  Meanwhile our patient is responding very well to new chemo. He had a port installed in his chest and was getting chemo 5 days per month with 2 visits to the doctor each month. When I picked up the rv it felt like it didn't have the turbo. Returned again and they found a hose routed improperly over the accelerator linkage. I took off again and still no turbo. I took it to Cummins Red Mountain where they discovered the air fuel control tube had broken. It must have been ready to go after the work done before leaving home. They ordered the part but got me on the road with a temporary hose.
We had time to travel. We went to Tombstone, Bisbee and Benson. On the way back the dash air quit yet again. No problem taking it back as I needed the storage anyway after learning it's illegal to park the rv in the street in Phoenix. First I returned to Cummins for the sensor line. While there they replaced the lower radiator hose and serpentine belt. Now it gets scary. I had a new belt onboard. I also had an old belt there that was too long. Since they didn't have a belt on hand I told them to use my belt. The mechanic used the wrong belt. I went to Loves to diesel up and the belt started squealing. I thought the ac compressor had locked up. I cut the ac belt and it still squealed. Returning to EVRV they discovered the Cummins mistake. They opened a work order and had me on the road with an open work order. They asked me to return after our trip for another look at the ac.
Next we were off to San Diego and Los Angeles and had dash air the entire time. I had a bill to settle so I returned the coach to EVRV. Now it really gets good. Now you have to believe they thought something may be amiss as I leave their facility with the ac working properly having been tested, driven and rechecked only to have it die again. That was not the case. These guys had a plan. Arriving early for work before the noise levels rise they pressurized the system and searched the hose run. They discovered a bad crimp on a union in the high side hose over the battery compartment. Great news."
3.5,1,"If I could give them a zero I would. I took my RV in to fix a hydraulic fitting that was leaking, an a/c service and to to get a routine service on a Onan generator. Every repair was butchered. Total trips were greater than 6 and I finally gave up and repaid another service center to do these correctly. After a $1700 bill I ended up with a larger leak in hydraulic line, an a/c system that did not even blow air in the cabin, and a generator that leaked both fuel and anti-freeze. The hydraulic leak was butchered by putting in a new fitting on a line that was not even leaking prior so I now had 2 hydraulic leaks. The roof A/C service had my A/C unit not in the duct hole and crushing the duct. Thus not allowing any air to blow in the coach. The generator had no issues and I just brought it in for a routine service. They said that I needed a new water pump as they claimed in had a slow leak. I said replace it as I trusted them. When they were finished I had a fuel leak at the new fuel filter and Anti-Freeze leaking. They said sorry and after 3 times stopped the fuel leak but NEVER was able to fix the Anti-Freeze leak. It turns out that they did not install the water pump properly.
Their facility appears professional and nice but their mechanics are awful. Ultimately you are only as good as your mechanics.

Stay away!!!"
3.5,5,"Just wanted to give a special shout out to Jeremy and his staff, absolutely the best rv repair shop I've ever been to. I had taken my Minnie Winnebago to East Valley RV Specialist for an overheating issue. After picking it up and heading home it started to overheat. I called the office and was told to bring it back immediately if possible, I did. Co-owner Jeremy got involved. Not only did he put his heart into it but also his own time, money and sweat, updating me daily. After picking it up, I headed for Sedona....and man it was a scorcher that day. Going up I-17 we hit a traffic jam, for the next 29 miles bumper to bumper stop and go traffic, disregarding the overhead bulletin that said avoid overheating turn off your a/c I kept mine on, blowing ice cubes the whole way NEVER heating up, not once. So you can imagine my surprise 3/4 of the way back home it went from Normal to Hot. I pulled over and coolant was leaking out. I called Jeremy, he and his mechanic were there within 45 min. It was a 3 inch long hose that had blown. He went to the part store got the part, installed it and replaced the coolant, even took the time to follow us back to town, never accepting the money I tried to give him. I just can't say enough about the integrity of Jeremy and his staff at East Valley RV Specialist. Thank You.

Sincerely,
Keith W."
3.5,5,"In Phoenix for 8 months to help a friend, we wanted to take him on RV side-trips when he felt good enough. We needed new dash air. Only 1 leak set us back but they made it right. I had the HWH leveling system pump replaced, air dryer replaced and engine charging system was repaired. The point here is that they had the equipment, tools and expertise to handle all my problems. We left Phoenix right at the end of the hot weather. I envy the Phoenix RV community for having a place like this available. We will be returning in the Spring and if I have any issues I hope I can still call them My Mechanic. I have a 1991 Foretravel, 5.9 cummins."
3.5,5,Very good experience. Had some damage when a tire separated. I was given a time frame of up to 3 weeks to obtain parts and for the repair. I also ask if they would check out a couple of other things unrelated to the tire damage. Both were repaired at minimal cost to me. Also they were able to obtain parts locally and my trailer was repaired in less than a week. Kevin also recommended a great place to purchase a replacement tire. Couldn't  ask for any better service. I will definitely recommend  these guys to everyone I know with an R.V.
3.5,4,"I had an air bag and some other work done by this company. The owner, Dan, supervised the work. A young fellow, John, did most of the work. Very professional. Highly recommended."
3.5,5,"Summary: Given the quality and care of their work, my wife and I HIGHLY recommend East Valley RV.  

Detail, if interested:  We own a 1999 Foretravel. Foretravels were complex, expensive coaches. Ours was built the first year Foretravel offered slides. Normally, we take our coach to the Foretravel factory for major work, but when its slide mechanism failed, we couldn't travel that distance.

East Valley tackled the repair, sent parts to HWH in Iowa for remanufacturing, and then worked diligently to make certain that, when the slide was put back into the coach, its alignment and operation were perfect. The slide hasn't operated this well since the coach was new.

Although not an inexpensive repair, because of the parts we needed and amount of labor required, East Valley's charges were completely FAIR. For the work they did, the time they had the coach, and the care they gave it, we couldn't have asked for better treatment.  We're very grateful.

Big thanks to Kevin and Russ, especially, and of course to the ownership of the shop, whose integrity we had heard about from another local business, even before taking our coach there. We would be happy to email, text, or talk to anyone considering East Valley RV.  Highly, highly recommended."
3.5,1,"I had a vibration that occurred in the front end of my coach which didn't allow me to go over 50 mph.   I took the coach to East Valley RV who had worked on it once before and ""seemed"" fair, competent and honest.  
They called me with a laundry list of things they said needed to be done which would have cost over $2,500.   I paired it down to just things dealing with the front end which still cost me over $1,100.  A week later, when I picked up the vehicle after hours, the front end was still shaking and I couldn't go over 50 mph.  In fairness, they did say it might need new front tires but that was AFTER the fact of me spending over $1,100 with them.   
I took it to an RV tire store who in 3 seconds (and no cost) analyzed why the front end was vibrating as one of the front tires had tread separation.   I authorized them to put on new tires in the front.   That led to the fact that the front rotors were cracked and the brake pads were bad.  This whole repair for tires, rotors and brakes ran me over $1,600.   
I feel East Valley RV SHOULD have advised me to get the tires replaced first (easy diagnosis), which would have led to the need to replace the brakes second and then maybe do some of the work they did do.  After replacing the tires, I would have taken it back to the to fix the brakes.  They could have had a happy customer who felt they were looking out for their customers.   
Instead, I feel they got their money and gave me back my vehicle with alot more work to be done.  They will not be doing any work for me in the future."
3.5,5,"Kevin, Tony & Stacy at East Valley RV are the best. This was our 3rd visit to them, working thru a couple of recalls on the coach as well as a plugged toilet line.  Tony went above & beyond to clear the line (major ewww) and clean up after. We'll go back in the spring for an annual service. These guys do great work."
3.5,4,"It's a cute, small park with a lakeview. Ample toilets and trees haha Seems to be an overall quiet and relaxing place although they are currently redoing the parking lot."
3.5,4,"This park is perfect because of its location. It's often busy or full, so arrive early. It's on lake Mendota and provides a lovely morning walk along the water. Since it's in the city (sorta) you can take a bus over to the isthmus for some shopping or dining or visit family in the area. Of course there are plenty of Wisconsin tourist places, but this little spot puts you right in the heart of Madison without having to be in a hotel. The boat launch area works great for our kayaks. And if you're up for it, you could boat across to state street! The lav facilities are decent for camping. There's a little beach to play with the kids. The park is small enough to prevent it from feeling like an RV park. I gave it a 4 star because it's perfect for what it IS. If you're looking for something else, well maybe you filtered too far. If you're looking to get AWAY, this little spot may not be what you wanted."
3.5,2,It is right on top of the highway and butts right up to a residential neighborhood. Doesn't feel much like camping but very acccessible canoe launch.
3.5,3,Good little campground for those with kids. Large play area near a beach. In town camping at its best! Bring lots of bug spray
3.5,4,"I wanted to stay overnight after the solstice bonfire at Little Norway, but the campground nearby(Blue Mound State Park) was TOTALLY BOOKED UP.

So, I surfed around on TravelWisconsin.org (a LOVELY trip planner there) and realized that I could camp on a lakefront with fishing and swimming onsite!  Such a deal!

Camping was $25 a night (w/ electrical hookup), and for that, according to the regs, you can have 3 tents with 6 adults in a spot. (FYI, If you book via internet, there's a $10 non-refundable fee and you must book 2 nights in a row.) You can just drive up and self-register, but it's not a huge campground. (I HATE surprises, so I always RSVP.)

Firewood is for sale on site, the people are nice and unlike many campgrounds, the gate stays open after 10, so you can stay out later if you like. 

There's a nice picnic pavilion, a shower house with flushable toilets and a dump station for RVs. 

Now, if you want that ""deep in the woods"" experience, this isn't the place to go. However, if you want to stay overnight in the Madison area without plunking down $100, it's a very nice option. 

I was happy with it."
3.5,4,"not for people who want total wilderness, but for a spot very close to madison this is great. the staff is friendly and the facilities are very clean. i would stay here again!"
4.5,5,"I had a check engine light show up on my 2007 corvette and an occasional rough idle. The car is supercharged and I wanted to take it somewhere that specifically deals with high performance sport tuned vehicles and not some run of the mill auto shop. I chose Doc's based on reviews. As soon as I showed up, the owner came out to see what I needed. I didn't have an appointment scheduled, but he still was able to take the time out to help me on the spot because of the quick nature of diagnosing my problem. He identified the problem and had me back on the road minus the engine light. He was able to adjust some fuel/oxygen parameters that were out of sink with each other. Looks like Doc's will be my go to spot for any further tuning or diagnosing needs."
4.5,5,"I was having some problems with my truck that each mechanic I took it to thought it was something else. I talked to Doc on the phone and he seemed to have a good feel for the issue and brought up some points I hadnt thought about. I brought it in they diagnosed and then fixed my truck to better than it had ever been. I had lots of questions and they patiently listened to, then addressed each one. 

They can handle anything from a basic tune to a full race build, and do it competently. I cant recommend them highly enough."
4.5,1,"This shop is a joke. It takes them way to long to do simple car mods. Two weeks for an oil catch can install and a whole month for a front mount intercooler install. I took my car into another shop for retro fitting headlights and was told that my passenger side headlight was an aftermarket. I told them that my car is brand new and hasn't been in any accidents. We came to the conclusion that Doc's either scratched or damaged the headlight without telling me. My mechanic also pointed out that Doc's did a real hack job on mounting my oil cooler to the Front Mount. Instead of paying attention to detail and mounting it, they used plastic rods that shoot through the oil cooler and Front Mount, permanently damaging the fins. A $400 oil cooler and $1,200 Front Mount ruined due to poor quality attention. Not worth my time and money taking my vehicle here."
4.5,5,"I was going crazy trying to fix my truck. I'd buy all sorts of parts trying to correct the lean condition of my Sierra 1500, nothing was working. Doc had me on my way in under an hour with the problem solved by a simple retune. Very helpful, with a great attitude. Thank you very much for fixing my truck."
4.5,5,Tuned up and jetted my carb on my chevelle after 2 different shops failed to get it right. These guys are knowledgeable and got my car running great in a day.
4.5,5,"Doc did street tune my vehicle and now my truck is responsing good, not stalling on the stoplights anymore, still not done yet with my truck got couple mods to do and will be back at Doc for a dyno tune.. I found the shop where i can take my truck when i will need some major work done.. will be back Thanks much and i recommend it to everyone.."
4.5,5,"Installed a Hooker Blackheart True Dual Exhaust for my 2001 Pontiac Trans Am and the Doc tuned it for me. Super flexible, accommodating and helped me out along the entire way! Knows what he's doing! Will continue going to him from now on!"
4.5,5,"Bad ass shop...these guys are extremely knowledgeable and helped me perfectly tune my 2016 Performance Pack Mustang. They walked me through what parts would give me the most horsepower gains, did all of the installation and then wrote a custom tune. I honestly couldn't be happier...thanks again to The Doc and the whole crew!"
4.5,5,Street Tuned my 99 GMC obs and I highly recommend this shop. Will definitely come back
4.5,5,"Although I don't think is Doc lowers cars on daily basis as a alignment shop does I decided to have him lower my SS Sedan since he provided me a good rate and overall seems to be a GM expert from our conversations.  I am very impressed with the quality of work performed to lower my SS, no issues what so ever, looks much better without so much wheel gap and now has stiffer suspension.

Talking with Doc for a bit its clear that he is a expert mechanic and think his shop can perform any custom services needed, another SS Sedan was at his shop getting headers installed and a tune while I was there which was cool to see sine its such a rare car, if I ever go that route with my SS tuning wise or engine modification wise will defiantly have Doc perform."
4.5,5,"Joe is the only guy I'd let touch my camaro! I've had my 600hp 700trq rear mounted turbo for almost 8 years. Joe was the original tuner and the car is still running strong today. I've had dozens of friends use other tuners in Vegas only to be disappointing with drive ability or longevity... Joe gave me both. He took the extra time to make sure the car was completely enjoyable to drive and not just a dyno tune for performance. And, he actually returns phone calls and follows through with even the smallest details that most shops don't care to bother with. Crazy, right? Haha! Thank you Joe!!!"
4.5,5,"I'm torn writing this review... Hands down the best tuner I've ever worked with; however, I'd like to keep Doc off the mainstream radar.   I'd hate for him to get too busy that he can't slide me into his schedule so easily.  I called him, told him what I was looking for and he got me right in.  He was honest about what to tackle next and from my own research and limited mechanical knowledge; I knew he was spot on.  No BS... no price gouging trying to charge you for crap that doesn't need to be done. I already know what Doc is doing next for me and ordering parts tonight. Glad to see there are still reputable, honest and knowledgeable street tuners in Vegas."
4.5,5,Very fast tuning and very cheap compose to prices I was quoted from different shops. He was very knowledgable and knew what I needed. Charged me one price and got me a lot more horsepower! I will definetly be bring my other vehicles there from now on!
3.5,4,"My Family needed to rent a van for our vacation in Las Vegas and we found Airport Van Rental. Their prices was so good  that we couldn't pass it up. Jason, the manager was was really helpful and such a nice guy. The van was clean and we were able to rent a car seat for my son as well.  We will totally rent from the again. The only thing is that their in a different location from the rent a car center, but you can still catch the shuttle bus and walk to their location."
3.5,5,"Wanted to celebrate my husbands birthday on our way to California.We picked up our rental car and was greeted with a pleasant smile by representative Mikayla. Mikayla is a very nice lady , they are very friendly, must come here to rent a vehicle...ACE rental car. Friendly and helpful staff."
3.5,1,"We tried to rent a car at the big rent a car building but couldn't use my debit card because of a crazy credit check. I tried this place at the suggestion of the clerk at the first company, they looked up the info online and told me they had cars and were open. I got there and they were closed, it was like 10:45pm and their hours said midnight, I couldn't believe it. I called this place again during my trip and talked to some guy named rich or Richard and he said I couldn't rent a car unless I had insurance. Again, totally different from their website. I think you guys need to fix your website or give better information, too unreliable to use you guys... Who knows maybe its one of those fly by night businesses that cant afford staff. Ended up renting from economy. At least they were open during during their posted hours."
3.5,5,"All I can say is AMAZING! I rarely write reviews, but this one I could not pass up. The customer service is excellent from the point of calling all the way up to leaving with the vehicle. Customer service is VERY PROFESSIONAL, Vehicles are newer models and EXTREMELY CLEAN, and most of all SUPERB RATES! I had the honor of personally dealing with the staff, Andrew (General Manager), Saul (Assistant General Manager), and Karen (Customer Service Rep). I felt like VIP. You receive personalized attention and they take their time and explain everything in detail:) As a business owner, I am VERY particular who we conduct business with. AVR is our choice for rentals and I'm even thinking about taking my customer service reps on a tour there to model how they handle customers. AVR keep up the good work!

Debbie"
3.5,1,I went to check on an item I might have lost in a rental 3 weeks ago. I'm gone back to the rental location 3 times and all three times I was told a manager would give me a call. 3 weeks and 3 visits later still no call. I've called and left 2 messages and  nothing. What else can I do?
3.5,5,"my group of 6 wanted to find a van that would comfortably accommodate us for our camping trip to Havasupai Falls. thankfully, we came across AVR and booked a 12-passenger van for 4 days at a rate even better than a dodge caravan. Andrew O. was our representative and he was amazing from the moment we walked into the office to the moment we signed the van back in. THANK YOU ANDREW! we were able to fit all of our crazy camping gear, plus sleep in the van the night before the hike. it wasnt the MOST comfortable for sleeping but it was spacious and did the job."
3.5,1,"DO NOT RENT FROM AVR     

7040 Gilespie St
Las Vegas, NV  89119 

                  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE 

Expect a runaround and BS!!! 

A one star only for the sake of the review otherwise it will be negative stars.

AVR /they don't have NO sense of customer service and they will rip you off big time! (You gotta be outspoken female otherwise your done, they take advantage of the guys because they won't allow them to be upset or outspoken otherwise they'll be told that they won't rent a car to them)    REALLY?!  

I made a reservation online and it said it was clearly unlimited miles for the 2 day rental so they advised my guy friends at AVR location on 7040 Gilespie St
Las Vegas, NV  89119 that in order to have unlimited miles I would have to rent the car for three days, and that they needed to add the passenger as a 2nd driver?! (he doesn't even have a Driver License!) MORE MONEY FOR AVR! 

AVR didn't even have the car I requested plus they made them wait almost 1 hour to get out of there (shaking my head). 
I've never had an issue elsewhere renting and this is the first time I've heard this.....so my guy friends that are only helping me and doing me a favor went ahead and agreed to do the three days to be able to have the unlimited miles. 
The next day.....We decided to do an early drop off, and guess what?  They want to charge us for that too!! 

According to my friends they were being very unprofessional and trying so hard to rip them off when they were there. 
I had no choice but to drive out there myself to take care of it ASAP after they gave my guy friends the worst customer service. I was beyond upset and embarrassed over this whole situation! 
I asked for corporate phone # and for all the names of the employees helping us....and I was quickly helped by the rental agent (careless Philippine lady trying to talk to us in Spanish WE ARE NOT HISPANIC LADY!! Lol) and the manager Maria. They figured everything out soon and NO I didn't let them over charge me or take advantage of us!!!
Manager offered a 10% discount for my next visit 
BUT GUESS WHAT??? 
NEVER AGAIN WILL I OR ANYONE I KNOW BE BACK HERE!! 

BUNCH OF CROOKS !!!!
THANK YOU BUT NO THANK YOU!!!! 

WHY MAKE ME GET TO THIS POINT?!!   WHY?!!  

TOTAL BULLIES!!! 

Also do not book with carrentals.com they gave me AVR to work with and you think you're getting a deal but you're really not. I'm booking from now on with Hotwire.com they work with professional companies and they have never given me the runaround. 

Overall the worst experience I have ever encounter with these people. I mean I don't know what I was thinking trying these guys out, totally regret it 100% . 
I thought I will be saving couple dollars but it's not worth every penny because I end up paying way more than I have ever paid for a rental car. 

Save your yourself some time, headache and money by not renting from this place period! 

BEST OF LUCK!!"
3.5,1,I had a reservation Las Vegas to LAX. When I went to the window they told me they needed two utility bills and proof of insurance. Nowhere in my online reservation did it say they needed such ridiculous additional documents. My rate was $36.00 for the day. I had to purchase a plane ticket for $233.
3.5,4,"First time renting from AVR, I love the price for a last minute reservation and I must say Ms Grace was excellent to work with even though it was a long wait but Grace made sure we were taken care off! Excellent place  for any kind size van. One suggestion  please cement your parking lot, almost broke my car from the uneven half concrete parking."
3.5,5,"KAREN!!! Best customer service from Karen ever. She helped fix, and edit our contract to give us a better deal than what we ORIGINALLY were offered. Please ask for Karen or Saul they are great people!!"
3.5,5,I have rented several times when I want to take an out of town trip and love it everytime. The prices are the best in town the service is excellent. This last time we had a mechanical problem while in Arizona after speaking with the general manager he handled the situation very professionally and kindly. I REALLY like this company. The building itself has a lot to be desired but who cares when the rates for new vehicles are so low!?
3.5,3,We emailed then called to contest the bogus gas charges on the van we returned with a full tank. They stated they made a mistake by entering the VIN number wrong and credited our account.
3.5,5,Great experience. Terri Z. Is the best. The best smile ever! Great customer service! I will definitely rent from them again.
3.5,3,"This is my first time renting from AVR. I arrived to pick up my car and unfortunately it was not ready. I had to wait almost hour for a minivan. The rep who helped me was Julius Cabrera. He was very friendly and professional. He got the process started with all the information, so when I went back I was ready to pick up the car and go. Thank you Julius!!"
3.5,1,"The van was fine and actually a surprisingly good value -- cheaper than a minivan half the size from a major car rental company. The service wasn't very professional or modernized, but was tolerable. When I returned the van, they pointed out a *tiny* chip in the windshield. Maybe it was new, maybe not. I had initialed that there was no damage and given how shady the office was, felt like I was going to get screwed. The guy said it'd probably be less than $50, and I might or might not get a bill in the mail. At this point, mediocre experience.

Two months later I got an aggressive letter from a debt collection agency for $22. I never received a bill and now my personal information has been given to an even more sketchy third party. Between the anxiety of getting ripped off and dealing with a fucking collection agency, definitely not worth it. Never again."
3.5,5,"We've rented several from them several times for our volleyball team, and they have always been very helpful.  We rent as many as 5 vans at a time, and have never had an issue getting what we need."
3.5,5,"Hi have to share that my shuttle driver was great! He was courteous and offered to take us home since we are local before we even left for our trip so we would not have that worry when we came back. The Kim really did a good job finding me the best rate for the trip I was going to take and gave us an even better price. She explained all the features of the van, more than any other rental place has ever done for me."
3.5,1,"Wish we could rate it zero stars, but not an option.  This place sucks!  Do not think for one minute you have a reservation.  You might think you do, but you will be sorry when you find out they ""lost"" your reservation.  We have tried a lot of car rental places at McCarran airport as we come here 4 times a year to visit family.  This has got to be the worst, however after using Hertz, Budget, Dollar and Thrifty we have found Enterprise.  They have the best customer service and competitive pricing of all listed."
3.5,1,"Customer Service was great.  
The van I rented seated 9 to 11 people. 
The van they rented me and my friends was unsafe.   The van needed brakes and shocks.  I became car sick, because the van was so uncomfortable.  I will NEVER rent from them again.  I recommend they upgrade their vans.  Going forward I will make sure the van is updated and safe.  
Katrina"
3.5,5,K.Marie was amazing . She went above and beyond to help. I would rent again. I had a easy time renting . I had a road trip to Los Angeles and had to rent last minute and she helped accommodate me and my family. I was afraid to rent at first due to the reviews but I'm glad I went there.
3.5,5,Christian was extremely helpful after a very stressful and delayed flight. He got what we needed fast for my family and with very reasonable rates. Van was practically new and in awesome shape. Thanks AVR for not having to worry about getting my family around Las Vegas! Will see you again the next time I'm back in town with the family!
3.5,5,"Needed a van for 1 day and this place worked out perfectly- inexpensive hassle free.  I had zero issues at any point the rental process.  Staff was not the friendliest but the van was nice, cheap and had no issues."
3.5,4,"Overall I was pleased with this company. I have read some of the 1 star reviews and can say I did not experience any of those problems. 

The bus from the airport to the rental spot drops you off on the other side of the street. You have about a 1/2 block walk to the office door. It was good and hot the days we were there. The office is spartan. The wait to start the rental procedure was extremely short. I have waited a lot longer at name brand rental counters. I had rented a minivan on a prepaid rental. The checkout procedure was quick and normal for auto rental. Driver license and credit card required. The normal questions: prepaid gas, insurance etc. Very little pressure as I declined all the extras. I did hear more pressure being applied to the renter next to me about insurance on 9 to 15(?) passenger van. The van I received was a minivan with 48000 miles. It was clean and had a few ding and dents. Van performed flawlessly over the four days I had it. Some confusion on returning the van. I am use to an employee in the return lot with a electronic reader that checks the car in and issues a statement. Not so at AVR. I finally had to in to the office to find someone to check the van in. I sure I was promised on invoice via email, but have not received it as the date of this review."
3.5,2,I rented a van here for the weekend which was 4 days. The van was great. Went to California for a camping trip. The only thing I didn't like was that the prepaid fuel was 60.06 to feel the tank up which is 2.31 per gallon. I will just put my own gas I will recommend not to do prepaid. I went to California with a empty tank I went to ampm and spent 56.00 to fill up the tank. I forgot how much was it per gallon but in cali the prices are hight in gas. It was 3 something per gallon. So do the math and think twice before you do that prepaid. If you staying in Vegas just put you own gas. In cali just do your research on gas before you go. So my point is there charging to much on gas 2.31 prepaid is not the way to go. Yes that's fine
3.5,1,"Spend the extra couple of bucks and have a better experience.

One star is too high of a rating for this place! 

-the place was like a meth lab in a small sea of old vans 

-the vans were crammed within the walled compound, and if all the vans were like the one I received, it was filthy inside the vehicle with cigarette burns and without a full tank of gas

-inside the building there was stained carpet, bad lighting and a few counters plopped near the one end and stale air as if people once died.

-the customer service was laughable; there were more people on staff than there was customers (there were 2 total customers) and I still had to wait."
3.5,1,"After a long day of delayed flights I missed my appointment time, if you miss it by 2 hours you're shit out of luck. They did nothing to try and help me out. I've rented cars several times and have never had such a situation happen. I understand it's in their terms of agreement but a little customer service goes a long, long way."
3.5,1,"I had reserved 2 vans for a camp trip for Young Life and when we arrived they looked at us and just said they were sorry but they didn't have any vans for us.  I had reserved the vans weeks in advance and even received a phone call two days before confirming I would be there.  We were told they over book the vans becasue they assume people won't show up.  We had to rush to find two vans and State Van Rental took care of us, they said this happens all the time, the agent was not surprised.  Only rent a van through AVR if you have a backup plan."
3.5,2,"We had a reservation for a 15 seater van last march 2018 for 2 days, i called before coming to pick it up & the hispanic guy said its ready but when we were at the site we had to wait for almost 2 hrs because they have to clean it. So the guys said the van is ready outside when i checked they gave me a van that has a BIG sign on both sides AVR SHUTTLE SERVICE ... i didnt rent a van to advertise the company so i ended a van with a defect on the sliding door when opening but better that the 1st one. Las Vegas guys you can do bettter customer service than that. Mitz"
3.5,1,"DEATH TRAPS!

Airport Van Rentals gave us a van that was grossly unsafe.  The seats were not connected to the van and at the first stop sign, our passenger was thrown from the seat.  It was a miracle that she was not injured.  It then took HOURS to get the van fixed.  They were combative at every step.  I will never rent from them again."
3.5,1,"If I could rate this zero stars I would. We encountered mechanical issues with our van that we rented and when we called my phone call went to the call center. I was told that they were bringing us a replacement vehicle and I ended up on hold for over an hour they tried to tell me to go to ""pep boys"" to see if we can get the van fixed rather than send someone with a replacement vehicle when it was the transmission that went out on the van. They told me that someone were on their way and that they were going to call and they never did, then I called and spoke to the manager Maria and she told me she would call me back - but when she hadn't called after 45 minutes I called the office and they told me that she had left for the day. I then got put through to a woman named Mona who was extremely rude and hung up on me. I waited from 7 o'clock at night until 1230 in the morning stranded with someone who is handicapped and a nine-month-old baby and they didn't seem to care. I had to incur the expense of renting a hotel room and also I was on able to pick my relatives up at the airport which was the whole reason for the van rental. This resulted in us having to take taxis which of course was another expense that we should not have had to incurred.  The vehicles are poor quality, they are not maintained. The customer service is horrible. I do not recommend this company to anyone and in fact I am filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Because their lack of service and safety for the vehicle, it interrupted my trip and there was no remedy or offer to resolve the issue."
3.5,4,K. Marie was a pleasure to work with. She answered all my questions and was professional. Thank you for the great service.
3.5,1,"Apparently a reservation means nothing. While waiting in line for 30 minutes, we were informed that a van would not be ready until 3 or 4 hours later. Well then.. see you never again."
3.5,1,"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY
I rented a van from this company in Las Vegas through carrentals.com, the price came to $524, full insurance was $72.
When I got home and checked my credit card is was charged $1221.
I rang the office and was told there is nothing they can do because they have my signature agreeing to everything, and said i bought extra insurance that made it this price!!
No way did I agree or was offered insurance costing nearly $600!!!
I asked for copies of my signature agreeing to this and every document i signed.
They said they would email it onto me , that was two weeks ago!
Worst experience ever with a rental company.
Im still trying to get a response."
3.5,1,Don't understand why would anyone gave 4 or 5 star for this unprofessional rental company... the customer service is BAD!!! Try to avoid is rental company!!
3.5,5,Andrew desireee and Maria are outstanding staff very attentive and pleasure to work with. Can't wait rental from this amazing company.
3.5,5,"Bad experience at first, but manager Andrew took care of everything and went way above and beyond making me happy.  Thank you, AVR!"
3.5,5,The customer service here was just SPECTACULAR! Julius Cabrera catered to ALL our needs with renting the vehicle for our family trip. I strongly recommend you book your reservation with AVR....THANK YOU
3.5,4,"Decided to risk the bad reviews and rent.  Our experience was great.  Yes, the location is a little further from the airport so plan for extra time picking up and dropping off the vehicle.  

The only issue we had was that our flight was delayed and we did not get there until after they closed for the evening (they close at midnight).  We did call them when we found out the flight was delayed and they gave us no problems about delaying our rental to the following morning.  

Of course they try to sell you on insurance and extras, just go prepared to thoroughly read everything before you sign.  And be firm. 

Car was fine - the interior was not as clean as I would've expected (some sticky spots on the middle console and the right passenger side sliding door).  Would rent again, just check that interior of the car is to my satisfaction before driving off site."
3.5,5,"Julius Cabnera, is a great car rental agent.
We rented a Van for a week , he was extremely helpful in us getting the right vehicle. Will return in future."
3.5,1,"Do not use this company!!  Only if you have to, save all documentation and take pictures prior to your rental. 
They tried to for 3/4 of a tank of gas, even though my contract was circles at 1/4 of a tank!!
They will 'nickel and dime' the agreement, by making you purchase the extra insurances.
Never again!!!"
3.5,2,Don't get me wrong. That female employee with bleach blonde hair. ( forgot her name) - she's super nice. I like her. This place is good for finding things that you need last minute. But I will never book with them again. First tried to give me an empty tank car even though I paid for prepaid gas they have. But she was nice enough to exchange for full tank even though that exchange took another 20 mins and made me late. But I'll continue to book with enterprise. Because even though they are more expensive. They are true to price of a rental. This place advertise at $188. Which made me choose them over enterprise but In the end I paid $327. No where near what was advertised. I don't like false advertising.
3.5,5,"I made my reservations on-line via ACE Rent A Car who processes the reservations for AVR (Airport Van Rental). Initially when I booked my reservation I was skeptical to use them so I booked another reservation at Alamo. The pickup location is across the street from the main airport rental facility in a converted house - seemed a little unprofessional compared to other companies in the airport rental facility. I worked with Erlinda who was nice, informative & professional. She put me completely at ease. She explained out of state limitations where the unlimited mileage reverts to a limited 250 miles per day when traveling outside CA, NV, AZ, & UT since I was going to Idaho. I had booked the van for 2 weeks but returned it in 10 days. There was no fee to return early - this is a way to avoid the $25 extension fee in case you need the vehicle longer. Erlinda checked me back in making this an extremely easy and pleasant experience.  I would use them again.  Ask for Erlinda!!!!!"
3.5,1,"When we arrived, we called them, as per instructions, to let them know we were headed to the car rental building where we were told we would be picked up by their van. It was 108* outside and we were waiting for 20 min.

After several calls, which went unanswered, a driver from another off site rental company gave us a ride after coming back to pick up his customers 3 times.

When we finally got to AVR, the building was tiny and people were spilling outside due to overcrowding. It had to be bad because no one would voluntarily be outside with those temperatures. 

The whole place was packed and the temperature inside was not much better. Only 2 guys were working the counter and they looked frazzled. It took an hour to get to the counter, another hour to get the paperwork done. This because they wanted to sell us added insurance. When we told them we were covered by our insurance, they gave a horse and donkey show about how some insurances don't cover recreational vehicle rental. We said we never heard such a thing. They insisted we have to call our ins company and they have to speak to the agent personally in order to confirm. At this point we should have left but we didn't.  After finally speaking with our agent and confirming that we are fully  covered, they finally processed our order.

From that point we had to wait another hour for our van to be ""cleaned"". When I inquired of the the manager, Mike, what is taking so long, he barked, ""We're doing our best""! Not a sorry or apology just WAIT! 

Finally our van was brought to us and it was old, dented, the rear camera was hanging by the wire, the carpet was filthy and the velour seats had grease on it. The air conditioner was not working properly. When I mentioned this to Mike, he said, ""Yes it is working! It's just 100 outside!"" I was so upset by his rudeness, I had to add that then it must not be working very well! He just grunted.

Needless to say we asked for our order to be canceled. We booked another ride with Alamo and was in our brand new minivan in about 10 mins! 

This place is the worst run business we've ever encountered. They were extremely understaffed, and tremendously over booked.

A family ahead of us booked a minivan for a little under  $400 and were told they required $800 in payment. It took them 2 hours to untangle that ""misunderstanding"". 

Another family booked a 15 person passenger van ahead of time and was told there was none available. They said there were children and elderly who were waiting to be picked up  and the guy at the counter just about yelled at him, ""What don't you understand when I say we don't have an available vehicle!"" Why do they take the bookings then?

From some other reviews it seems they are not always this disorganized but we will never use them again!"
3.5,3,Customer service bad they don't respect the customer the customer is always right but they find a way to say something to you and smile at the same time whatever very disrespectful
3.5,5,"I needed a van for a group of people in Las Vegas. I booked over the phone and it was simple. I took the shuttle from the terminal to the car rental area. Then I walked across the street. My van was ready upon arrival. Staff was extremely helpful, Katice and Terri gave us information and recommendations that were very helpful upon pickup. Dezi and versa helped our check-out go smoothly and quickly. I'm looking forward to renting from them again. My van was even equipped with satellite radio and a backup camera."
3.5,5,"Great service, the best prices!! They accommodated me even though I arrived two hours early. Highly recommended!! Mikayla was awesome!!!!"
3.5,5,"I cannot remember everyone's name who works there but I wish I could. My experience with AVR Las Vegas was top-notch and Annie (and the whole staff) was extremely kind, professional, and competent. Thank you for a great customer service experience!"
3.5,3,"This place does not have air conditioning in their office.. or it may just be the Vegas heat.. but I'm pretty sure they don't have A/C. Anyway, their customer service was okay. The Van that we rented was good enough for us but I wish they had a van that had rolled down back windows.."
2.5,1,"Their customer service skills are 0. We were on the lot for3.5 hours and was either ignored or blown off by 2 of their employees.
So we went to Collier RV in Rockford and bought there."
2.5,1,"Scottsdale RV is a joke. Customer service is a deplorable waste of Time. Only one person there to communicate.Service is slow no sense of communication, no callbacks to keep you informed. They need a little come to Jesus meeting with the BBB and a attorney  General representative."
2.5,1,"Went to Scottsdale RV because they were the only dealership that carried the brand and model that we were interested in.  I totally can't understand the great reviews on this place.  I have never seen such a dirty, disorganized place of business in quite awhile.  My husband and I were treated rudely and the guy that ""helped"" us was totally uninterested and dismissed us quickly.  Showed us one trailer, then was finished with us.  No offer to call or follow up in any way, very rude and unhelpful.  We won't go back, even though they were the only ones to carry that brand anywhere in Arizona.  I would rather drive to the factory in Indiana!"
2.5,1,"Horrible customer service! I called Chris and gave exact details on what I wanted/did not want in my RV and my exact weight limits. He told me he had the perfect one and come on down. Once I arrived I was told someone else was going to help me. The first RV that was ""perfect for me"" was way over my weight limits. Although I did find the one I wanted, the salesmen took days to answer simple questions. They day I was going to purchase, he sent me a text and said I'm leaving on vacation! It's been 2 weeks and I've never heard from him again. I guess my RV purchase was not important to them."
2.5,5,These guys provide the best possible pricing and service I've ever seen for Motorhomes and Rvs.  More importantly they make sure your experience in the future stays great!  Thanks again Cris and Ryan
2.5,4,"We like the unit  and it was delivered only one day late but a title would be nice. 
Update ; It take a while to get the title as we paid in full at delivery. But we did get it. Thanks Guys!"
2.5,5,"Amazing place! I honestly expected to feel ripped off like you do when you buy something new or used from any dealership... The only thing I didn't like was they really didn't know their RVs and the packages that come with them... To bad such nice guys. I truly feel like these guy genuinely care... Which is amazing now day... I'm so impressed because I picked something out and he actually he showed me something that was actually less money (less commission for him) but fits me much, much better... Wow! (Now days...) I'm shocked at the honestly of these guys! Love it, you can't imagine how impressed I am! Except for the fact that you pay for something you don't actually get... Hence double pane windows.."
2.5,1,"Avoid this place.  Promises are given when you are signing the bottom line.  But, good luck in having the promises to come through.  We are still waiting on some due items.  It's been almost a year.  Waited this long in writing a negative review, in hopes, the promises would come through."
2.5,5,"Its not too often that you're impressed with an RV company. We arrived with an electrical challenge and to our surprise, walked out Scottsdale RV in a few minutes. 

One of the gentleman mentioned he had been there 14 years and the way he approached the RV when he heard the issue made that experience very evident. 

They gave us tips, instructions and even pulled the RV into a safe spot to continue our voyage. 

Bottom line: Have an RV? Give these guys a try."
2.5,5,We called several local RV dealerships to help us out with an AC system we were having a challenge with and none of the local dealerships were making the time to help.  Both Chris & Keith from Scottsdale RV went out of their way to help us out. This is why service makes all the difference.
2.5,1,"The management here will tell you anything  to get you here, then you realize all of the lies. I flew in from out of state with promises that everything was ready. When I arrived nothing was done: old tires, no oil change, missing beds, no headlights or turn turn signals. And no remedies! I'm booking a flight home!
Please save yourself and don't come here."
2.5,2,"I give 2 stars because of Chris being helpful and nice.  Found the brand and model of used camper we were looking for.  Called and asked and were given answers.  Made a trip over to Scottsdale RV on Monday, from Sun City.  Checked camper inside and out and decided to buy.  Gave a $500 security deposit and were told to come back the following Monday, to pick it up.  They needed time to detail the trailer and assure all was working correctly.  Received a call on Monday morning to reschedule and they were running behind.  Said ""no problem"", we could pick it up on our way back from a trip to Tucson.  Arrived around 11:00 and trailer was not ready.  They did repair/replace some items, which was nice.  They fixed the water heater, replaced two outside convenience lights, tried to glue the table top laminate back on (glue didn't hold), replace the A/C inside ceiling cover (said it was yellow) and replaced the radio/CD player.  Inside was poorly detailed, windows filthy, carpet not vacuumed, stove not cleaned, bathroom not cleaned, heater vents were filthy, it had 2 batteries and boxes when we looked at it but only had one battery and box, when we picked it up (battery may have been new), water pump worked intermittently.  They installed the equalizer hitch improperly and the trailer pulled horribly on the way home.  I checked the tire pressure and all 4 were 15 pounds (or more) under-inflated.  I pulled the trailer to a level spot and checked the hitch/trailer alignment and it was incorrect.  They had it set for too much weight on the hitch which lifted the front of the truck.  The poor towing was from the incorrect hitch install and tires not inflated correctly.  When the were setting the hitch, I pointed out the the truck and trailer were not on the same level (mostly due to a rock covered lot and not a concrete or paved lot).  I was told it would be ""OK"", but I could check it when I took it over to the sales lot to sign the papers.  Another issue was the finance officer not being able to print our paper work so we could leave before heavy traffic.  With Chris' help, he finally made it work.  As it was late and not wanting to drive across Phoenix in the worst time of day and the fact I had no tools, I decided to try and pull the trailer, as it was.  Bad experience is an understatement.  I called the next day to voice my concerns and received a very weak ""sorry, here is the tech's name and number, call him"".  All of this to say, those that have posted low reviews are not complainers, they truly had issues.  As this is my 8th RV, but only used one, I have done the necessary adjustments, cleaned the camper, took out the carpet and removed a large dustpan of dirt from under it, and made modifications to make it our own and am very happy with it.  Given our experience, I can't see ever dealing with Scottsdale RV in the future, but have learned to ""never say never"".  I understand they were in the process of moving but that should not preclude them from giving great and expected customer service."
2.5,5,"I never owned an RV and wanted to buy one and get started RVing .  I talked to several dealers in the Phoenix area doing research for over a year, but did not know which RV I wanted or what kind of pricing deal that I could get.  I discovered Scottsdale RV near my office, and stopped by ending up talking to the most knowledgable person I had ever met in this business.  Noah at Scottsdale RV  is awesome and rather then trying to sell me on just anything, he gave me tons of information enabling me to narrow down my decision. Then I started researching price (and I know how to find the best pricing, I have purchased many cars and houses - I am no spring chicken in that area), and found that the price at Scottsdale RV seemed like a wholesale price, hence I purchased a new Coachman Liberty Express 279.  Thank you Scottsdale RV and thank you Noah, I am enjoying my RV immensely having taken it on the road for a 30 day 5000 mile RV trip.   Also, I have had follow up service work done, with amazingly helpful installation and repair technicians at Scottsdale RV - all is good and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase an RV."
2.5,1,"Well Ryan B, since I assume it's your business I could see why you gave it 5 stars. I have a different view.
Complete lack of communication. Didn't even try and call back after being disconnected by phone. I was the one who called back.
I was the one asking all the questions and even asked if they wanted a deposit and they agreed and never called me.
They knew for a week that we had planned to make the 3 hour drive and yet they waited till the morning we would be there to start working on it and cleaning it. I even emailed them the day before since I haven't heard from them in 5 days. They were sealing the roof and the generator was laying on the ground waiting to be repaired. So there definately wasn't going to be a test drive anytime soon. 
The interior looked as if a family of 8 had lived in it, far from what was advertised.  I was told it was in nice condition and that everything worked. I asked if there was anything negative he could say about it and he couldn't come up with anything. 
Someone ripped the bedroom tv out and pieces just laying there.The chassis light dimmer was broke. Something must have burned in the microwave and pieces of the wallpaper were torn off. The bedroom window valance was rubbed through the cloth.
I could go on but you get the idea.
This was in their advertising and so far from the truth,
""All of our motorhomes go through a rigorous inspection before delivery. We also service the generator and engine. It is a non-smoker, no signs of pets and definitely not lived in.""
This is the part that really bothers me. I was told Ryan just pulled in and he never came out to meet with us or even say sorry for the disappointment and long drive. 
Be sure to check out 3 complaints with the BBB and the excuse of being out of the country in a remote area. That should have been my sign to stay away."
2.5,1,"Did they lie or were they just too lazy to check?  Drove over 100 miles one way to check out a coach for sale.  I was assured by two different people at this facility of the engine size (I'm looking for something particular).  The day before, I left messages with two different employees to confirm the appointment and that my long drive would not be in vain if the coach already sold.  No one returned my calls.  When I arrived at Scottsdale RV the next day, I expected to see a store with a showroom.  Instead, I see something more akin to a salvage yard!  I'm shown the coach by another individual (the third with this company), and he wasn't sure where to look to verify the engine size until he looked under the hood.  As sure as heck, they were WRONG about what they THOUGHT they had.  The guy showing me the coach felt bad when I told him how far I traveled and how they SHOULD have verified what they had in stock instead of just ASSUMING!  I told him they owe me gas money and declined to look at the new coaches that he was trying to sell me.  This company has a history of being slow in rectifying problems, based on some of the complaints I've read about them with the Better Business Bureau.  They are notorious for also not returning phone calls!  Scottsdale RV, you owe me gas money for traveling 230 miles for NOTHING!"
4,5,"Had some Electrical issues with our touring RV and they fixed the issues within minutes, washed down the rig and trailer and we are off in no time at all. Great service, super nice staff. Would recommend this place to anyone touring in an RV or Bandwagon. It's 1/2 a me down the road from THE NILE THEATRE."
4,5,I've been using the Arizona RV Super Center for about 3 years now 4 maintenance and repairs on my aliner trailer. Anna Marie scheduled the work that I have had done and also provided valuable advice to me. The technicians that worked on my trailer were extremely competent. I've always felt that Anna Marie and other employes wanted my business. Arizona RV Super Center provides quality work at a reasonable price.
4,5,"We took our motor coach in for extended warranty work.  New air bags, new awning, and control panel board for the automatic jacks.  It did take some time which is OK at the end of the day all of the work was done to our satisfaction.  I would like to thank the entire staff for their professionalism and courteous service.  Thanks to Lance, Anna Marie, Chris, and Mike for everything.  I would definitely return in the future.
Thanks,
Jeff"
4,2,We saw that this evening service center had a four star rating. We found it to be very pricey compared to the numerous times we have had it repaired in the past and we were promised it on a Friday morning and did not get it back until mid-afternoon after going there as we could not get info over the phone. We would not recommend it.
4,5,These people really know what they are doing.  I took my toy hauler in there after a towing company dropped it of the hitch.  All sorts of problems.  Everything was fixed perfectly.  Some of the fixes were done better than it had originally been manufactured.  Their attention to detail far surpassed my own.  Really impressed and I'll be back for sure.  My only regret is that I didn't find them sooner.
4,5,"Ive been a customer for what feels like about 6 years now.  I mostly use their service department to care for my motorhome.  Are they perfect?  No.  But take a drive up and down Main Street and find one that is.  I used (and was abused by)  no fewer than three service companies along Main Street before I found AZ RV Supercenter.  One company (just to the east of them) repaired my generator to gas tank connection only to leave me stranded just hours later leaking gas in a Costco parking lot.  One charged me so much for minor repairs I had to take out a second mortgage on my home and get a part time job.  Is it sometimes hard to get a hold of the service department?  Yes.  Are they always exactly on time to complete the work?  No.  But the mechanical world of RV's and coaches is as unpredictable as any industry and the more thorough they are, the more time it takes to handle concerns.  The more time it takes to handle my concern, the more your concern is pushed out into the future and vice versa.  Above all those things I want honesty and fair pricing.  I get that with these guys.  

I've learned to give RV service people a wide berth.  I give 7-10 days longer for repairs than what I think I should allot and I have never been disappointed.  I don't drop off my rig the week leading up to a holiday and I don't make unrealistic demands.  I want them to be thorough and if, as is often the case, they find something wrong that wasn't part of the original issue I want it addressed for safety and peace of mind.  

Anna Marie runs the service department.  You will recognize her as the one who gets things done.  Nobody busts their butt more than that woman and it would be wise if you brought her flowers and/or chocolates routinely because she is so valuable to the process.  Once, while at NASCAR, we blew a water pump on day one and had no idea what to do, so I called Anna Marie.  She just happened to have a mobile unit working NASCAR and (although they were booked) within an hour she had the guy installing a new one in my rig.  I expected to pay standard NASCAR gouging fees for the new water pump and they charged me what they would have charged if I would have brought it in to the shop.  How's that for service?  I have yet to deal with anyone who provides more honest service with similar pricing and I've been to a large handful over the years.  Thank you Anna Marie and crew!"
4,5,"Great service! Fast, friendly, helpful - this is the way all RV places should be run. I used to take the rig to the huge RV dealer in Mesa down Mesa Drive. But scheduling a repair was awful - maybe they could take you in three weeks. But no more - Arizona RV Supercenter is where I'll do all my business from now on! The only complaint is that they need a more clearly marked entrance."
4,4,"Drove out from California to look at a trailer that we did not end up purchasing, it didn't end up being the right one for us. But prices are good, Lance was really helpful, gave us a video tour before we drove out was not pushy and gave us a lot of info. We are still on the hunt to find that perfect trailer for our first purchase but if you are local, check it out!"
4,1,"Did warranty work of over $2000 on my RV and broke the item and would not stand behind fixing it even after I spoke with senior management.

Steer clear!!!"
4,3,"These guys are better than many. Unlike many RV places I have dealt with, they are honest and do what they promise to do. On the first visit this place got me in and out faster than I could even get an appointment from my dealer who was telling me there was a 6 week backup in service. Anna-Marie keeps that place going strong.

Second time I took it in they did take longer than predicted and they were difficult to get a hold of during the work day. I fear they will get (or already are) too busy and popular by being so good."
4.5,1,Ana is a dishonest business women. I ordered custom sheepskin seat covers. She tried to pass of I'll fitting cheap version. After several weeks of VERY unpleasant interaction she reordered then . They are a better fit but still feel the quality is not what I expected or what I had gotten there before. I will never do business with them again
4.5,5,"The leather on my Mini Cooper ""Sidewalk"" split. I thought I could fix it myself, but yeah....  No. I took it to Palacios. Anna is cool! She had it fixed and back to me by the end of the day. Worth the $125 and the 1 hour trip. I love my Mini, so getting it done right was important to me. I'll be back with my patio furniture cushions.w"
4.5,1,"Took my 1964 GTO conv. in for a new top. 

1. The lady behind the counter has Fuzzy math! Caught her attempttng to add an extra $400 on to the bill, she later apologized for her bad math. 

2. upon lowering the top for the 1st time, my glass window shattered. Palacios refused to stand by their work. 
DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR CAR!"
4.5,3,"Revision: Owner issued apology for the experience, so I giving a better rating based on that. The experience was still not favorable after taking my grandmother's car in to get a quote to replace the headliner. I was told it would be $400.00 and would need to pay $70.00 to order the material. No big deal. I ordered the material and waited a week. Three days later, the car was in an accident and totaled. When I called to get my money back I was told its non-refundable. (I completely understand if it is policy). When I called back a week later asking to pick up my fabric, I was informed it was not there. Overall, it was a $65.00 life lesson."
4.5,5,"Super people. I took a ""boot cover"" for my 1969 Fiat convertible in for repair; they fixed the item at a great price; quick service too!"
4.5,5,Professional in every way!! Jesse and his staff completely remodeled my 2004 35' A class motorhome and it looks amazing. The price was fair and the work was beautiful. Jesse had great ideas and the extra touches were amazing. If you want your RV remodeled look no further than Palacios.
4.5,5,"We found Palacios on Yelp (Yelp has yet to steer me wrong) when we were looking to repair the leather pouches on the back of the seats in our SUV. We were preparing to sell the car and both pouches had ripped completely off and were hanging from the bottom.

The woman at the front desk had one of the guys take a look immediately, quoted me $175 and told me they could have it done within the week. Deal. They were a couple of days later than they initially told me (and I had to call them to find out if the job was done), but they did great work and the seats look perfect again. The bill came to $155 (always refreshing when a business comes in under their quote).

 Excellent quality work, I would go back to Palacios with any other leather/upholstery job, no question."
4.5,5,"Anna at Palacios was a delight to work with. She expedited the reupholstery of our two mid-century occasional chairs, and she was so patient with us as we selected a cat-proof material (textured vinyl that looks like tweed!) for the cushions. Palacios mimicked the original style of cushion wrapping and piping and finished ahead of schedule. Palacios also offered the most competitive estimate of all ten we received through Yelp."
4,5,"This company had a groupon and my Nitro's interior needed to be cleaned BAD from a grout blowout while moving flooring materials. I was able to get something scheduled within about a week from calling and two workers came out to my location this morning to begin detailing. I had no idea how dirty my car really had gotten over 5 years until I just saw it completely and professionally cleaned. They took about 3-3.5 hours - I love that they just took the time they needed to take versus applying a time limit. 

And I had no idea they were mobile and come to you! Super convenient!

I cannot say enough good things about this experience and the results - I handed out cards to everyone at my job gushing about what an awesome job this place did for my auto - I wanted to hug the workers once I saw how beautiful my car looked (but I controlled myself lol) 

I talked this place up so much that my company's owner might try to set up a group auto detail so that they can come here and do a bunch of other employee's cars. 

Use these guys - they are totally awesome and amazing!"
4,5,"I cannot say enough about the service and good work I received at this small but efficient auto shop.  I took my wife's 2006 Camry to C&C Auto Aesthetics to get a full service detail package.  Prior to this service, her car has NEVER been detailed.  In fact, I do not think she had it washed/vacuumed more than once per year at most.  That said, the car now looks like new.

EXTERIOR:  The wheels were horrible, black muck covered chrome; and now they are shiny and bright.  The windows, bumpers and general exterior are as clean as I have ever seen before, super squeaky clean down to every detail.  Even inside the little door where you find the the gas-cap is gleaming (and I am 100% certain this area was never cleaned on this 9 year old car).

INTERIOR:  The interior looks like a different car.  If I did not know better, I'd think they replaced the carpet and seats.  My wife is an ex-smoker (quit just 2 months ago), and yet there is now zero trace in this car of her former disgusting, smelly habit.  There is no smoke smell, and not an ash to be found.  Every tiny compartment is polished from the ashtray to the sunglasses holder to the drink holders in front and back, etc. The rubber moldings around the doors and windows were all glistening.  Seriously, it looked like new.

SERVICE-TO-COST:  I dealt with the Owner/Operator, Marc.  He was very professional and flexible.  Like most people, my wife and I work long hours during the week.  Mark was willing to accommodate us on a Saturday morning.  We dropped off the vehicle at 8 am and it was ready a few hours later as promised.  I thought the initial price was fair.  But when I saw my wife's car, I realized it was more than fair.  There is no way I could have gotten that car that clean and new-looking even if I spent 20 hours on it.   

I am not easily impressed, but I am blown away at how good my wife's car looks now ... so much so that I brought my own truck in the following week whereby I received the same attention to detail.  I highly recommend this place and could not be happier with the outcome."
4,5,They got the yellow paint stain out of my seat and a year of moving smells and spills are gone! Marc is also very nice. I'm so glad to have a clean car again.
4,1,"Beware... the owner of this establishment will try to rip you off.  I purchased a groupon to get a full car detail here and was extremely disappointed with the customer service here.  When I arrived to drop off my car the owner informed me that on top of the money I had already paid for the groupon, there was going to be a surprise last minute additional $40 charge to get the dog hair out of my car (nowhere on the groupon did it state anything about possible additional charges).  When I told the owner I was not comfortable with a last minute 40% price increase when the groupon stated it covered the entire auto detail, he began to argue with me and tell me that's just the way it was.  His attitude was the worst.  I would recommend taking your business elsewhere."
4,4,"They did a great job,  had a groupon. Super nice and polite and did a great cleaning job. They missed the center storage ""bin"" between front seats and the glove compartment, but did a great job w cleaning."
4,2,"Sadly, I'm editing my review after two negative experiences with the company. I was essentially blown off twice, the first time it might have been a misunderstanding on the date - even though I called and left messages but never heard back until I tried again a few days later. But the second time, unacceptable, I'm sorry but you were so apologetic and said you would make this right so you scheduled me on Saturday, I moved my whole day around (again) had a temporary garage fab made and cleared my morning plans only to get a text almost an hour AFTER you were supposed to be here saying you had other cars you were working on and ""sorry for the inconvenience."" Unacceptable. I think you did a great job on my last car, my husband's car, and I've referred other people to the company but reliability is huge for me - especially because I had to work around my schedule to make sure I could get a mobile detail."
3,5,Scott with mobile mechanics was very professional and a great help to our motor home. Would certainly use the service provided again. A big thanks to Scott.  Anyone that needs any repairs can count on mobile mechanics. Efficient service and very convenient. Tony Chapma
3,4,"Kieth and assistant removed and replaced my motor home gas furnace motor. Good service, good job."
3,5,"Larry was dispatched to my location and arrived within 20 minutes. He was virtuous and got right to work. The slide out on my RV would not slide back in, not even with the manual override. Larry had it back in place quickly, and filled all my tires with air (my sad little compressor would have taken hours). 

Not cheap by any means - but great service."
3,5,"Mobile mechanics came to my work and fixed my car outside in the parking lot during my work day! It was very convenient and my car was fixed and ready to drive home at the end of the day. They did not rip me off and gave me warranties for the parts that can be used nationally, one of which is a lifetime warranty.  They were easy to work with and very responsive. Thank you Mobile Mechanics."
3,1,"BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY FOR THEY ARE SHADY CROOKS!  DO NOT CALL THEM FOR HELP - WHATEVER YOU DO!!!  

I am from Los Angeles.  My gourmet food truck would not start after catering an event in Vegas.  I called Mobile Mechanics of Las Vegas as they were the first listing on google & I was in a hurry to get back to LA for another job I had to cater that same night.  I was told by their dispatcher that the mechanic was finishing up another job and that it would take at least an hour for them to arrive to diagnose our truck.  She told me the diagnosis would cost a $125 service charge then whatever the problem was would be additional. OK fair enough!  I was on the phone with her for all of 2 minutes when she asked for my credit card.  This was prior to her even sending anyone to look at my truck.  With a bit of hesitation I gave her my Visa number.  She said she would call us when someone was on their way.  We continued trying to start the truck & within literally 5 minutes it turned over & started. We had previously been having a sporadic problem with the truck starting for the past week.  I called the dispatcher back & told her we were able to start the truck & we were headed back to Los Angeles.  I preferred to have my own mechanic fix it when we got back.  She placed me on hold & put a male on the phone who told me that they already sent someone so they were charging me $125 for the service fee.  I told him that I had just 5 minutes before spoken to the dispatcher who informed me that I may as well go to lunch as the mechanic wouldn't be able to come look at the truck for at least an hour.  This guy would not let up & when I checked with my bank (after I got off the phone with him) he had already billed through the $125 for the service fee.  What repair shop charges you before they even look at your vehicle???   These people are not on the up & up but I tell you what!  They messed with the wrong person this time!  I filed a fraud charge with my bank who assured me that since there was no signed paperwork & since no one came out to look at the truck they had no grounds to charge me that service fee when they did nothing to my truck.  Sometimes you have to play hard ball with people.  What a way to run a business!  Sheesh!!!"
3,5,Brandon was able and knowledgeable.  He did quality work and was able to find the step motor we needed.  I would recommend.  Responded within two hours as promised.
3,5,"Called 5 other mechanics to fix my ac and water pump.  This was the only one that could make it.  Brandon was here in less than a half hour.  Diagnosed the problems,ordered the parts, and got me a discount.  Had me up and running in no time. Very polite and knowledgeable."
3,5,"We couldn't get out tire of the car because of a stubborn lug nut. After 3 days of trying we contacted MM , they sent out Joe to our house and he got it off. We were finally able to change out our flat tire... imaging the frustation... Joe was very friendly and professional. I recommend this company to anyone with car issue ."
3,1,The price I was quoted over the phone was much more than the than the bill i was presented for the service. the mechanic was rude and intimating.stay away from this place. all they want to do is rip you off.
3,1,I called this place on 5/28. I was attempting to set up an appointment for saturday. I was impressed when the girl on the phone said they could do it today. I immediately rearranged my schedule to get my ac fixed. No one showed. I called the next day on friday the 29th to attempt a saturday appointment again. She nice lady said she had no clue why i was stood up he would forsure be there today. I rearranged my schedule again and was told he would be at my home in 1.5 hrs. That was at 430 this afternoon. It is 8pm and i get a text saying another 1.5 hrs. I had plenty of time to read reviews while waiting so i told them no thanks.
3,1,"They are thieves an liars. They destroyed the car instead of fixing it and refuse to refund their outrageous prices even though they never fixed the problem they were called for. 
The office is rude and disrespectful. They yell over the phone and refuse to listen as to why your upset. And they use profanity for customer service. All in all I would never recommend these people to work on the car of anybody I have ever met."
3,5,"They should have told me on the phone when I ordered the service that I should have cash up front or would charge 5% for use of a card and I would have gone to the bank prior to the mechanic showing up.

That said, I have to give them a 5 star rating as I have used them more than once over the years and have found the mechanics to be honest, fast, and friendly.  Recently their mechanic Joe solved, within one hour, an electrical mystery that had my pickup down for weeks.  I am very pleased.  I often always felt used when I take my car to shops, but I don't feel this way with Mobile Mechanics."
3,1,"HORRIBLE PLACE!! The owner, Steve, cussed me out on the phone and hung up on me. Took a company truck in for repair, paid by credit card and picked up truck. 2 miles down the road, truck broke down. Took it back in and were told it needed additional repairs. Steve, the owner, suddenly decided that he wanted to be paid in cash and insisted on crediting our credit card for what we had already paid, and told us we had to pay in cash. When we tried to reason with him because our employees don't carry $2000.00 cash on them, nor do we send them that much cash, he finally agreed to accept a wire transfer. After the wire was sent, he still refused to release the truck, STILL insisted on being paid cash, and cussed me out and hung up on me. We seriously considered calling the police. I finally had to have my banker call him to explain that the wire transfer was completed and the funds were in his account. THEN he released our truck. Most unprofessional, irrational, rude, awful person I have ever dealt with. DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE THERE!! BEWARE!"
3,4,"excellent service!! when I gave them a call, the guy who answered seemed extremely unhappy and irritated which made me question if I should get my work done with them or not. but then Brandon, the actual mechanic, arrived to the worksite and knew exactly what he was doing, was prompt and did it willingly with a cheerful attitude. he gave me a great first impression of the company and the guy on the phone should really learn from his employees on how to make a paying customer happy. they do a big favor for convenience by coming straight to where you need them and who doesn't love that? it is also very affordable and he tried to be very flexible with my price range. if brandon wasn't my mechanic today I don't think I would continue using them; but because he was and did it without an issue, I will continue to use their services! thanks Brandon, you were awesome!"
3,5,"We were in Las Vegas for our 23rd anniversary first time without the kids in 10 years had everything planned and we went to our truck it wouldn't start luckily enough we called and searched for a mechanic in Las Vegas we got in touch with mobile mechanics of Las Vegas... our repairman was LARRY..he was wonderful, very experienced....it was on a holiday weekend but Larry came out us to our hotel, the Elara Hotel on a Sunday morning...JAN 17, 2016... got it back up and running within an hour and a half to two hours and we were so grateful to get back home to Riverside County..if I'm ever in Vegas again and my auto breaks down Larry would be the first one that my husband and I will call to work on our vehicle he knew exactly what was wrong with it.   I 've had  this truck in to a repair shop in Riverside County and they could never figure out what was wrong with it but I get all the way to Las Vegas and the truck breaks down thank goodness LARRY was there to help assist and get us back home to our two eautiful kids...THANKS AGAIN LARRY WE TRULY APPRECIATE IT.  the service was reasonable especially on a holiday weekend and we didn't feel like we were getting ripped off like a lot of others services...Keep up the great work LARRY and keep that wonderful personality.......Deb & Lamar Perris,ca. Riverside County"
3,1,"Don't like it

Charge you two times more in town
For 120 $ they charged me 389$ 

Chose for better one not this"
3,1,"Wasted $300 trying to fix a misfire in my engine. Ripped off for $85 just for them to come look at it and charging it as ""labor fee"" these guys have no clue what they are doing and will just try to throw parts on the car. All they got me was additional headache and frustration. Just a fair warning."
3,5,"So MOBILE MECHANICS OF LAS VEGAS. 
I needed some work done on my truck and they came out the same day when I called. Lee was my mechanic and he did a good job, he was a cool guy! I would use mobile mechanics of Las Vegas again. They do the work well and they give you a good price for the work and I love that they come to your house! So use them really.. 

Ask for Lee good mechanic."
3,5,"Customer of the Subaru WRX STI Turbo- special thanks to Travis with Mobile Mechanics you guys are awesome! My son got stranded in Las Vegas on Spring Break. His timing belt was giving him problems we called several places and got several quotes they were going to charge us anywhere from $800-$1200. But you guys went to my son solved our towing problem and went above and beyond to figure out the problem you attacked each issue until you got to the route of the problem. Within 3 hours and only $500 and that's a great price when your dealing with an STI TURBO, my son was back on the road. Thank you so very much, the worst feeling in the world is a parent being helpless so far away and unable to help there teenage child. Thank you for being honest, prompt, delivering quality work and keeping constant contact while picking up parts. I'd give you. A ten if I could! In our book you guys will always be a ten! Keep up the awesome work! Tonight My son is home in Salt Lake City Utah!"
3,5,"These guys rock!! I blew a hub on my single axle boat trailer and was stuck. Scott got to me when he said he would and fixed the hub quickly. Great guys to work with. I hope I dont need their help in the near future, but if I do they will be getting my business for sure. Thanks again Scott!!"
2.5,4,"My mother and stepdad are full time homeowners at Cotton Lane Resort and asked that I post this review as they don't belong to Yelp. 

We have lived at Cotton Lane RV Park for 13 years. We all have gone thru many changes in the park. 

One of the best changes is the new Office Manager, Sheila Ellis Leonard. She is a delight, and she is bright, pleasant and loves her job, and it shows. She always greets everyone with a smile and she does her job efficiently. She makes sure she fulfills all of our needs and requests, and makes sure to follow-through and keep us updated. Who could ask for more? 

Also, the new owners have improved our park in so many ways, we are very thankful. They also are a blessing, and our park is now a standout because of them, and it is exciting to know that there is more to come!"
2.5,1,This rv park sucks big ones. If you like camping in the Gobi Desert this is the place for you. No trees anywhere but lots and lots of gravel in the large spaces. Wifi is available if you pay for it. Laundry room is clean. Swimming pool is heated. Not too friendly of a place. We won't stay here again.
2.5,3,"For the most part, this is a decent park.  Fairly quiet, reasonably priced, well maintained, nice indoor pool and a dog area.  The downside to this park is the very small RV sites and the fact that there are only two men's bathrooms and only one has showers, and they aren't very private.  That's not much for a park that has nearly 500 sites.  Also, apparently they even close them at night.  I don't know if I will go back when I return to the area."
2.5,1,"We were very disappointed in our stay at Cotton Lane RV. Moved here in mid Oct and was planning to stay till May, but after the 3rd increase, (now up to $600 a month) we are out of here. I must also say that they do not offer anything worth a $600 fee for a dusty dirt lot and we did not utilize anything within the park. Laundry is so small and if more then a few people are in there, you cannot get around, so it is less hassle to go to a public laundry. We were thinking of a park model, but not after showing us how they do business."
4,4,They have been on this corner since i was in grade school was always an eye sore. But since the oldest boy took over he has really improved the lots and buildings. Glad to see all the positive changes Eastlake needs many more businesses to improve their appearances.
4,5,"Jerry & Sons!  We bought that '05 Smart car from you and had it shipped to Illinois 3 months ago.  We couldn't be happier with it.  Looks new, drives great, and fits inside our Thor Outlaw 29H motorhome like they were both made for each other.  You guys were awesome and fun to deal with.  THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!"
4,5,"Great customer service, honest answers to my questions.  Bought the car from out of state, and Jerry was helpful with my shipper.  Very professional, made buy buying experience pleasant, even fun.  Thank you Jerry & sons!"
4,1,"Not a ton to say I went here and three other lots along vine street.. One of the others, like this one was seemingly rude however I don't recall that dealers name. To that end I had to look for the guy working here and when I finally located him he just seemed like he could not be bothered. The cars, ranged I supposed. A couple nice cars but most seemed kinda beat. The dealership looked old and tired. Just not a very impressive experience and certainly not welcoming."
4,5,"Best used car purchase ever. Bought a 2010 Sonata and Team at Arko listened to what I needed, took the time to go through the inventory, and was willing to work to get the deal done fairly. I shopped for a long time and these were the guys. A true family run business where they honored every word. 1st time ever buying a car that I felt good about it."
4,5,"Jerry was totally honest and straightforward throughout the whole process, super professional. Although we couldn't make the sale happen today, Jerry will definitely be my first call the next time I'm ready to buy!"
4,1,"We haven't had a good experience at Fraserway RV in Airdrie. Here are the defects on our brand new Thor Gemini 23:

- Tankless water heater doesn't work
- Sewage connection was bent down, couldn't connect to it
- Blinds fell off (and some are loose)
- The fridge panel is detaching
- Loose hinges above the sink
- Outside TV doesn't work
- There is a patch of plastic fabric detaching (looks like protective cover for wires)
- Drawers don't snap in, keep opening while driving
- There are holes letting in cold air (and we're worried about mice)
- Dashboard panel clip is broken
- Blinds don't roll up
- Some of the power outlets don't have power

The services has not been good either. 

Darin, the sales manager, hung up on me after I told him I was extremely frustrated and asked him to please be patient with me. 

Al, a technician at Fraserway RV was awesome. He helped resolve an on-the-road problem. Al really seemed to care and know the unit. My wife and I were really impressed. 

I've put together a blog post with pictures and videos, hopefully, this will help others.

Update (Sep 30): We coordinated a walk-through as part of dropping the unit off for its warranty service; to get all the things fixed that should have been fixed before taking possession. I'm happy we showed up at 6:50 PM because no-one knew about the appointment, and the service department was closed already. Thankfully Steve, one of the sales managers, jumped on the issue and saved the day. Thanks, Steve!

Just there is no confusion, we got the appointment confirmation from Fraserway RV via email (September 21, 2016 at 4:32 PM).

Here are the first 2 bits from the Fraserway RV confirmation email:

This email is to confirm your drop-off service appointment on 09/26/16 at 07:00pm.

This allotted 1/2 hour appointment is scheduled solely with a service writer to check in your unit, address your concerns and write up a work order to have your unit serviced by an RV Technician.

Update (Oct 14): Issues continue. The slide-out stopped working. Batteries need to be replaced. Water heater still isn't fixed. Thor is unresponsive."
4,5,"You want to make relaxed vacation in a RV? Book with Fraserway...

Good vacation start with good service - this is what we got with Fraserway every time. We first booked in 2004 and came back frequently.

The motorhomes are in good condition and the service is excellent. The introduction is available in multiple languages and they take the time needed to make you feel comfy before you leave with the 'big car'... 

The complementary shuttle from/to the airport and hotels is convenient."
4,5,"The sales staff at Fraserway are some of the most knowledgeable and helpful people we've encountered in our search for our first fifth wheel. Luke and Steve answered all our questions, and some we didn't even think to ask, when we met at the RV show. They followed up afterwards to be sure we had all the info we needed. Very professional."
2.5,5,During my recent trip to Phoenix I needed to have my Sprinter chassis RV serviced with an oil change and a new cabin air filter.  I was very pleased by the professionalism of the staff and the mechanics at Patriot.  They had me in and out within about an hour allowing for some time for the engine to cool.  I found their pricing very fair and they are willing to allow the customer to bring their own supplies if arranged in advance.
2.5,5,Stopped by the shop for a repair on my truck and can honestly say I'm impressed on how they focus on customer satisfaction. The owner personally helped me and went over prices for parts and labor and the entire time staff was very friendly. Will definitely come here again for all my repair needs. Highly recommend!
2.5,1,This is the absolute worst excuse for a repair company as I have ever seen. They come and tell YOU they will get the part. I asked the office idiot what the  total price would be parts labor and taxes. She quoted a price then when the repair was finished the price went up $20.00. The head moron mechanic tried to say it was because  they did not know what the taxes would be the next day. Now come on taxes don't change over night they were are and will be the same for the foreseeable future.  Then when i got yo my offgrid location the repairs failed and i called in twice but they never had the professional courtesy to return my call. Great customer service. NOT!!! In short these jackasses are morons and crooks. STEER CLEAR OF THEM.  Don't waste your money with their company
5,5,"I rented this trailed and let me tell you it is awesome. The rental process was a breeze, trailer was clean, fully stocked and in perfect working condition. Will rent from them again if I am in need of a trailer!"
4.5,5,"We recently rented a little teardrop camper from Lance at Rv Rental Outlet.  We used the camper off and on during a 3 week road trip. It worked out great for us! Lance was wonderful to deal with and even agreed to reimburse us for a spare tire we purchased on the road just in case we got a flat. We were worried about driving in some rural areas and not being equipped with everything we needed in case of an emergency. He completely understood and quickly agreed to purchase. We were complimented everyday (sometimes several times) on how ""cute the little guy was."" Highly recommend them and we will definitely be using them in the future. 

Thanks again,

Jeff and Robin Zientek"
4.5,5,"Amazing staff and service! It was my first time ever renting an RV and they will have my repeat business for years to come. When I called a month before country thunder I didn't think that there was any way they would still have a unit available. But, Cameron worked magic and got me the perfect one for our group. When we picked it up, Jamie was fantastic in demonstrating how to use it, and had us in and out in no time. They answered questions in minutes during the festival, and even had a tech available! I couldn't believe the level of service that came with such a reasonable price tag. I'll never do a country thunder without them again!"
4.5,4,We rented from RV Rental Outlet two years in a row. Shauna has been fantastic to work with. Other than having a tread blow out on a tire each time we rented (we had trips of 10 & 28 hours on desert highways in May & August) there RVs and service are fantastic. As is their pricing. We've already booked for again next summer.
4.5,5,"I work for a event production company and we used RV Rental Outlet's event suites and motor homes to house our talent the night. The event suites were phenomenal, equipped with a fully functional kitchen, comfortable furniture and satellite tv! Our talent that used these spaces were very pleased! 

Not to mention, the staff and owner of the company completely accommodating given our tight drop off and pick up times.

I highly recommend using this company for any occasion you might have! A++"
4.5,5,"Working with RV Rental Outlet and with Lance in particular was an excellent experience!  Our family of four had never rented an RV before so we were a little nervous about this adventure and about the quality of vehicle we would receive.  Lance made the rental process so easy; all done over the phone.  He was also able to make the large, high-end 2015 vehicle we rented very affordable.  The pick up process in Mesa was efficient as was our return, as Lance kindly came in on a Sunday to help us process the vehicle.  The RV we rented was absolutely, perfectly clean with high end finishes throughout.  The kids loved sleeping above the cab and the pillow-top mattress in the main sleeping area was extremely comfortable for the parents.  Storage space was plentiful and everything on the RV was in perfect working condition.  Our family had a very memorable long weekend vacation and we will definitely be renting from Lance and RV Rental Outlet again."
4.5,5,"I started my rental process back in February for my trip to Burning Man in August. They were great getting all the paperwork to me I needed for my insurance and contract pages. It was easy to add additional items to my rental, like chairs and coolers, later on after the initial paperwork was done.  Lance specifically was a great resource since I had never driven an RV before or even stayed in one for that matter. It was all very foreign to me, and he helped with tips and advise to make the trip easier. Everything worked great on the RV with no problems. 

I rented the 29 foot Coachmen. It was perfect for my needs with plenty of storage. They recommended to estimate 1 gal of gas per hour of generator use. I think our actual use came out to about 0.33 or 0.50 gal of gas per hour of generator use."
4.5,5,Lance at RV Rental outlet has helped us the past two years with our annual camping trip rental. He's always so accommodating and willing to go the extra mile. He even met us on his day off so we could re turn the RV when it was convenient for us. And he even did it with a smile! We will definitely plan to use them every year! The RV are always in top top shape and they do an excellent job upgrading them to the newest models!
4.5,5,"We decided on doing a family vacation to Colorado for some white water rafting. While searching for a place to rent a motor home we were referred to RV Rental Outlet. Boy are we glad we came here! David was wonderful. He helped explain everything to us.The whole process went very smoothly. We were in and out quickly. The day of pick up Jamey walked us through everything and made sure we understood the ins and out of our rental. Both David and Jamey were so awesome and so helpful! The Motorhome we rented was a 2017, super comfortable and very nice inside. We will definitely be returning here for our next family road trip! Thank you both for being so wonderful and helpful! I definitely recommend RV Rental Outlet. You wont be disappointed - from the nice and helpful staff all the way to the pick up and drop off. Super easy and smooth."
4.5,3,"We were looking for a gift for person who had recently purchased an RV. Not being an RV owner, we had no idea what to get them. The staff at RV Rental Outlet was very helpful in assisting us. The gift was a success."
4.5,5,"My family rented a 31' class C RV from RV Rental Outlet over the Christmas holiday, to travel to Kentucky to visit family.  We've never done anything like this before, and I had no idea what to expect.  These guys made it so easy.  Everything worked well, and when I had a rookie question about the propane tank, I texted Lance late one night, and he called me back within minutes to walk me through the process for getting it back up and running.  They gave me a great deal, and made our bucket-list trip a total success."
4.5,5,"This place is amazing! It was our first time out as a family using an RV...total newbies...and we had a blast, and the folks here took good care of us...especially Kam, Lance, and Roger....they all made themselves available to help us with whatever we needed. A great company...can't wait for our next trip. :-)"
4.5,5,"This is a GREAT place to rent from. The staff is very friendly and helpful. 
We had a little issue with our generator before we left town. And even tho the store was closed I contacted Lance and he arranged for Jamey and Greg to meet each at the shop. Jamey & Greg had me and my family on the road in less then 10 min. 
It's service like this that will keep me coming back. 

Thanks 
Gabe"
4.5,5,"Just returned from a 5 day tour of Southern AZ with a travel trailer we rented from RV Rental Outlet.  This is the second time we rented a travel trailer from them, and both experiences were outstanding.  Lance and Kam were great to work with, and Roger reviewed the trailer with us before we took off.  They all know their stuff.  We had a couple of glitches the first night (due to our inexperience, nothing wrong with the trailer), so we called the tech support line. They got back to us within 15 minutes and talked us through the issues.  Worked great.  We will be using them again and it was, as I said, a great experience working with the wonderful staff at RV Rental Outlet."
4.5,5,Outstanding customer service with RVs in pristine condition. Team members made the entire rental process extremely easy and were available at all times to answer any questions we had during the duration of the rental.
4.5,5,"We wanted camp without the ruggedness of using a tent. Deciding to rent a trailer was a little nerve racking but David at RV Rental Outlet was very accommodating and helpful. Especially when we decided on a larger trailer at the last minute. The trailer, a 22 foot, was clean and the staff was informative and hooked our vehicle up with everything we needed. We rented a generator and equalizer bars, highly recommend for driving up north. The M20 trailer was great for 2 adults and 2 kids. They loved the bunk beds. Pick up was a breeze and drop off was just as easy. We definitely recommend renting from RV Rental Outlet. Thanks for letting us travel without any worry."
4.5,1,"Initially we were so excited to find a local place to rent a travel trailer from and RV Rental Outlet seemed perfect.  The trailer itself was okay and clean enough, but the microwave did not function and the battery was so worn out that it would not hold a charge even if we hooked up to our truck and charged the battery for hours.  In fact each time we wanted to use lights (for more than 30 minutes) or bring in/out the pop-out we had to hook the battery up to our truck so it could run off our battery.  

But the biggest disappointment is...upon our return from the first trip (this past February), we reserved a trailer for the upcoming month of August and put down a deposit.  After thinking about our trip camping, and how much we enjoyed the time out, we decided to purchase our own trailer and not rent again.  So we called RV Rental Outlet on May 4, 2015 to cancel our August reservation and get the deposit refunded....It is now June 9, 2015 and we are still waiting for our deposit to be refunded.  We've made 4 calls and each time they come up with a different excuse as to why we have not received a refund.... What's up guys?  Is this how you run your business?  We are very disappointed in the way RV Rental Outlet has handled our cancellation.  The battery issue was something that we could deal with, but keeping money?  Think not...."
4.5,5,Rented RPod and everything was great. Lance is awesome and there for you if something is not right! Def going back!
4.5,5,Lance and the staff at RV Outlet were amazing. Booking a rental from out of state is risky. Not being able to see the unit ahead of time. But we arrived to find a very clean well maintained unit. We had a small problem when we reached our destination but one quick phone call and they brought another unit to us quickly. Great experiance. Would definitely recommend them.
4.5,1,"Unfortunately we used this company to rent an RV for a large company tailgate.  They forgot to provide any of the additional packages we ordered and paid for and they gave us an RV that had non functioning AC.  When I called they advised me that the RV would only get about 30 to 35 degrees cooler than the out side temperature which would have been great!  It did not happen.  The AC when you placed your hand right up to the vent was cold but it wasn't blowing at all.  I called again after the vent and spoke with David our original salesperson and he was less than helpful.  First he argued with me about the AC.  I have 40+ people who would be happy to attest to the fact it DID NOT work and there was 0 degree difference with the outside.  Yes, we kept everything closed in an attempt to cool the thing done, to no avail.  Then he told me our refund for the forgotten items and our 2k deposit was not in their hands anymore.  It was now with the bank.  Huh??  We gave them a check not a credit card which I explained more than once.  Still nothing. I still haven't seen the funds back and our event was October 8.  Awful all the way around."
4.5,1,"Found their website when searching potential places to rent a small rv for the weekend. Unfortunately, I didn't get  past more than a quick call to their location to ask if they had availability and if pets were allowed. I believe the gentleman's name was Lance that I spoke with whom was extremely curt and off-putting. If that is how your customer service is when just making an inquiry call I won't be renting from them. If you answer the call be prepared to answer questions from your customers and not sound annoyed by them. At least pretend that you care."
4.5,5,Unfortunately it didn't come to a booking from our side but the service provided by Lance was outstanding. He guided us through all models and was willing to make impossible things possible. The prices were great and the service and patience from Lance was one of a kind. We were even invited to their Thanksgiving turkey. Next time I'll get an RV and only from here and I'm sure it's amazing.
4.5,5,"I rented a travel trailer for an elk hunt this went from Lance and his team. First off, they were very flexible about my drop date, which is crucial for big game hunts. They were very accommodating and gave me a great price for what I was looking for. After calling around, they were the best price by far. 

The pickup and drop off were very easy. The techs were very helpful explaining the details to a first time trailer user. The drop off took all of 5 minutes and I was on my way. 

Very helpful, very accommodating, highly recommended."
4.5,5,"Cameron was the sales person who helped us.  He worked around a few things to give us a great quote on a weekend rv rental.  He was very helpful.  The technician who showed us
how to work everything was great too.  Especially since this was the first time we ever rented or drove an RV.  Thanks again.  We'll use you next time for sure."
4.5,5,"Great team who answered all of my questions and provided me with an excellent rental unit at a fair price for my trip to King of the Hammers. Dry camping is not recommended for 1st timers but with no hookups available in Hammertown it was the only option. The 25' travel trailer towed well behind my 1/2 ton truck and worked out great for our trip. I would suggest sway control if towing through hills or high wind areas.

$40 to dump the tanks upon return was well worth avoiding the unpleasant task!

They have earned my future business and referrals.

PS- Following return while packing up supplies, I realized several items were accidentally forgotten in trailer's storage compartment. I was concerned that these might grow legs and wander off but 1 text after hours on a Sunday and an immediate reply later I was assured that all items would be pulled from trailer and set aside for p/up at my convenience. This was confirmed with a followup on Monday AM ensuring everything was safe."
4.5,5,"I highly encourage you to rent from Dave at RV outlet! Very friendly, great prices and exceptional service! I thought for sure I was going to buy a class A after renting one, I may rent a few more from Dave before I buy.... that way I know exactly what I am buying!!!"
4.5,5,"I cant say enough good things about my entire experience with RV rental Outlet. Renting an RV from New York was a breeze. When I arrived in Phoenix, everything was ready for us and our trip. Lance was super helpful through the whole process. The paperwork was easy, and the cost was reasonable. The RV that he suggested (Coachman 26) was perfect for the two of us on our 12 day rental. It was an easy drop off after we were done as well. Everything we needed came equipped with the RV; for example, kitchenware, tp, camping chairs, coolers, and outdoor table. Aside from my RV the customer service that I received was exceptional. I am so impressed with the customer service from everyone, and am so appreciative of their efforts to mail my diamond necklace that I left in the RV. I highly recommend this place and their RV's"
4.5,4,"This would have been 5 stars if not for some reservation communication issues that were ultimately resolved.  That said, this was our first RV rental, having previously owned a pop-up trailer.  The trailer we rented was in great condition, everything worked well, and the staff were very informative and helpful with instructions on how to operate all of the components.  We will definitely rent from them again!!"
4.5,5,Great price and truly excellent service. Lance and Kam were fantastic to work with!  Thx guys. We will be back!
4.5,5,I've been working with Tim Lewis for a couple weeks to get trailer taken care of for our vacation it was a great experience and can't wait to go camping again thanks again Tim
4.5,1,"This is a terrible company!! We rented an rv for my daughters wedding and when we tried to get ready for the ceremony there was no electricity:( and to make things worse - the toilet didn't flush!! So instead of having a nice place to get ready - we ended up having to do makeup,etc. With no electricity and we all had to use portapottys. When we dropped off the rv and told them about our problems - they said they never offer refunds - which is crazy if their rv was useless!! We have lots of friends and we will be sure and tell everyone to never use RV Rentals!! If I could give zero rating I would!!"
4.5,5,Connor hooked us up for Country Thunder next year! Go see him for your motor home rentals!!
4.5,4,"My husband and I rented a hybrid travel trailer from RV Rental Outlet. The trailer looked really nice online. We went with their recommendation on the hybrid travel trailer. I couldn't wait to use it during my husbands mountain bike race, I'm not an avid camper. We had some issues with the battery so we ran the generator as much as possible. Cam & Lance were very courteous they offered to come out & service the battery but we decided that would be difficult with the amount of people at the event so we toughed it out. After my husband returned the trailer & discussed our situation, Cam & Lance compensated us for the inconvenience. We would definitely use RV Rental Outlet again. Lance & Cam are A-Ok in my book."
4.5,5,We had a great experience working with Lance to plan our RV trip to Lake Tahoe this summer. The vehicle was comfortable and clean and they were very reasonable on our rates. We look forward to working with Lanch again. Thanks
4.5,3,"The coach we had was nice and clean when we picked it up and drove well.  Once we started camping however we had issues with the electrical systems and had to spend some time working with RV Outlet to get it resolved.  

Ultimaley they sent out a local repairman who replaced the batteries and that resolved most of the issues.  There were still a few electrical issues that we were able to work through and completed our trip.

Once we returned the RV they offered to comp a couple days and waive the mileage overage, which I thought was huge.  I understand things will go wrong sometimes, it is how you respond to them."
4.5,5,Great place for a smooth transaction in renting a camping trailer. Lance was a great help with all the initial details to supply us with a trailer that fit our needs. Jamey was a big help with walking us thru the trailer and familiarizing us to the rental to make for a really fun camping trip. I will definitely use them in the future. Anne Marie was a great help in the service department helping me with further needs of servicing my own trailer. Great experience all around.
4.5,5,Absolutely great experience renting from you folks! I recommend RV Rental Outlet to everyone. The whole rental process is smooth and efficient. I have worked with Lance multiple times. He is beyond professional and truly cares about his customers. He always goes above an beyond to make sure that we have a good trip. Much appreciated RV Rental Outlet and much appreciated Lance!
4.5,5,Great service. Very accommodating with our needs. Kam exceeded my expectations. He ensured that we selected the right trailer by asking all the right questions. Highly recommend them for trailer rentals.
4.5,5,"Kam,

We cannot thank you enough for making our camping trip so much better. The team at the rv outlet was great. From setup to disconnect they are awesome, courteous, professional, and we will return."
4.5,5,"Best RV rental business in town. The process was seamless and the RV unit was great.
Konner and Jamey made the experience pleasant, professional, and answered all questions.
Thank you so much.  We will only use RV rental outlet in the future."
4.5,5,"I just got back from a long weekend trip. I rented the r pod trailer and it was really good. I have rented others from private and other dealers but this was a great experience. Lance is an absolute pro.  This is hard business to be in considering you can't control all aspects of customers experience due to traveling. Hat's off, great job. Easy check in check out and the RV was great. Minor hiccup on the brake controller but a job well done. Thank you Rob"
4.5,5,"We looked at a lot of different options when considering a RV rental company. We finally settled on RV Rental Outlet in Mesa. The service we received from Lance and then Kam was outstanding. The pick up process was a little lengthly... but this isn't just a car you are renting. As a 1st time RV renter I appreciated their attention to detail and how patient they were answering every question. 

The RV was a 31' class C ""bunk house""and it was great. Well maintained, clean, good mechanical working condition and easier to drive that I thought. 

Return was smooth and friendly. We will be back to rent again for sure!"
4.5,5,"The Come Thru Guys!!! They literally saved the Fam RV Vacation 2017! Thank you Konnor Jackson for staying late both times for pick up / drop off. 
We had reserved our RV with another company back in May for our July trip. That Company had to cancel our reservation on Saturday the day before we had to leave. Ahhhhh! Konnor Jackson was only RV specialist to pick up the phone late on a Saturday, have an RV avail and and literally stayed open past closing so we could get down there to secure the rental and Save Our Fam Vacation!!! 
He was courteous, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. 
If I could give them 10 's I would! 
Thank you so much for all your he"
5,5,Mark and Michael were on time and very professional. They fixed our thermostat the same day! Loved their work ethic and price and how quickly they got the job done. Will definitely call them the next time we have a problem. Keep up the great work!
5,5,"I have had the distinct pleasure of meeting people from this company. They came out right on time, well, within the appointment window, and they set to work.

Had a problem with my Splendide 7100xc washing machine, a weird sound coming from point where the drum connects to plastic housing.  After looking at it they determined there was nothing they could do to fix it, without taking the drum out of the machine. This would've proved costly.

In the end, they couldn't fix my issue, however they are consummate professionals and did everything they could to fix it, short of taking the drum out.

Because of that I highly recommend this company and will call them again if have something that needs doing."
5,5,"Even though they were not able to come out in time to fix my water heater, they spent a few minutes with me on the phone and gave me enough information for me to fix it on my own. It was just a 2 amp blown fuse.

Many thanks to desert mobile RV repair."
5,5,"Our second time using their service. If you're looking for a professional company with service tech's who arrive on time, have knowledge and resolve your problems effectively, at a fair price, this team is for you. Planned a stay in Vegas to have them work on our nagging issue with the water pump. I asked them to look at another issue and they fixed that too. All done in our spot at Oasis RV Resort. I don't trust anyone else for our RV's repairs, especially the dealer. I made an appointment this time, but the time before it was another serious plumbing issue and they came out the very next morning. Reliable, trustworthy and skillful."
5,5,These guys are the best!!!  They have great customer service and their work is awesome!!  Plus they are reasonably priced.  They're our go to company for work on our motorhome.
5,5,"We had a problem with the Atwood range/oven unit in our new travel trailer. Although they are not a warranty provider, and we had to pay for the repair, the owner Mark gave us a reasonable price and a break for paying cash. Both he and his tech Michael were extremely nice and very professional, and they had it back together in 30 minutes. We recommend them."
5,5,"These guys bust BUTT! In hot summer weather, they did some work on my RV, did it for nearly half of what Camper World and another mobile company had quoted. On-time, super fast, cleaned up, and super nice people too."
5,5,One of the nicest and most fair people I have gone to for anything. So glad to have found Mark
5,5,Had my cooling unit go out on my RV.  Mike & Mark were awesome.  They made a few trips out to make sure that all was working fine.  My fans quit running and they fixed it at no charge to me.  Great service and great guys.  I'd you need something fixed give them a call.
5,5,"We needed a faucet replaced in our RV. We had used a different mobile RV repair previously and weren't very happy with the experience. We made an appointment with Desert Mobile and, miracle of miracles, they showed up exactly when they said they would and did great work at a very fair price. They were efficient and knowledgeable and couldn't have been nicer.

It is very refreshing to do business with folks that know what they are doing and also respect your time as much as their own.

Mark and Michael are now our go to people for any RV work we need done."
5,5,Great and friendly service!!! Worth the money to protect your investment. I highly recommend Bob Moses Ceramic Coating!!!
5,5,"I stared seeing post and advertisements for Ceramic Coating about a year ago. I have had a few friends who have had their vehicles, boats, and/or RVs ceramic coated, and their vehicles always looked like they were freshly washed and waxed. They told me that they hardly have to put any time into keeping their stuff clean anymore. I have had multiple RVs and the worst part about owning one is having to wax it or pay big bucks to have it waxed multiple times a year. So when I bought a new 40ft Toy Hauler a few weeks ago I decided I was going to invest into Ceramic coating. I looked into all the companies I could find around the Phoenix metro area and decided to give Bob Moses Ceramic Coating a call because of all the great reviews. When I called Matt answered and spent tons of time on the phone with me going over the process, the results I would get out of the coating and the different options and what he suggested. I decided to schedule with them, then 2 days before I was supposed to drop it off I got a call reminding me about an appointment for my daughter at the same time that there was no way to reschedule, I called Matt back and he made arrangements for me to drop my trailer off early. I got a call a day and a half later and he informed me that it was done, the exact time he told me it would be done. I showed up to pick it up and WOW, I was absolutely shocked at the smoothness and shine my new trailer now has. Matt and crews end results were way above and beyond my expectations. After my first small trip, couple hundred miles, I got home and my front cap was full of bugs. As instructed, I took a garden hose to it and 98% of them just fell off, light scrubbing took the rest off. Something that would normally take close to an hour took less than 10 min. I want to thank Matt and everybody at Bob Moses Ceramic Coating for your great work and excellent customer service."
5,4,I had Matt and the guys coat my 14 year old boat and they brought it back to new. They did a great job and were very professional.
5,5,"Had my ceramic coating done just over a month now and Bobs Ceramic Coating did a great job.  They got right on it when I dropped it off on a Friday morning and worked on my 2016 Toyota Tundra Super White.   Prior to having this work done the truck had been washed at the dealership after every service. Unfortunately they put it through their car wash procedures and it left just a little bit more damage to the paint.  Scratches, swirl marks, and water marks. I only wash my truck now by hand. The following morning I picked the tundra back up and I was very pleased with the work.  No scratches, swirl marks, or water marks.  The truck looked even better then it did when it comes off the assembly line. The best part about going with the Ceramic is the cleaning. Just a few days a week I use a microfiber waterless towel and go over it with very little pressure. Dust, bugs, and anything else that normally get a vehicle dirty just comes right off.  I haven't needed to wash it yet. I use a waterless cleaner that I also purchased that basically takes anything else off that won't come off with the towel itself.  It also has the properties of the Ceramic Coating by cleaning and polishing without using water.  I was reluctant at first not knowing if it would work as advertised. I need to say that I'm completely satisfied with the work that was done by Bob's Ceramic Coating. They do warranty it for 8 years and also ask that the truck be brought back in after the first 18 months just to give it a good look over and if needed will bring it back to the original protection and shine. I recommend Bob's Ceramic Coating and if your in the Service or a Prior Service member Bob offers a Military discount. I give them 5 stars. Their customer service is also top notch. Great group of guys there.  Thank you Bob and crew.  I will be recommending everyone I know who is interested in having it done.  It's worth it.  You truly get what you pay for. You want it done right, give Bob a call."
5,5,"Highly recommend. These guys did my 
toy-hauler, Can Am X3, and truck. Awesome jobs and customer service was epic. Much appreciated."
5,5,"I could only wash my truck so many times or have detailed at the local car wash so many times. My truck being 10 yrs old it needed something to bring the life back into it. To bring that shine back. I could not be more happy with the outcome of having my truck ceramic coated. Matt and his team has made my truck look brand new. My truck looks better than my wife's brand new Highlander. Looks fresh and has reflection for days. 

Project was completed in a timely matter and the Customer Service was top notch!! 
Beyond happy and Customer for life!"
5,5,Re'al and all the guys at the shop were great!  They made my black 2017 F250 look like a mirror!  Can't recommend ceramic enough and Re'al and the guys at Bob Moses really go above and beyond to make sure they do it right - they treat your vehicle as if it's their own!  You can go to them with absolute confidence.
5,5,"I learned the hard way that RVs are designed to be outside are not built with materials that like to be outside. I like my stuff to look good not only for my satisfaction but for resale value. I was spending way too much time cleaning and waxing to try and maintain this 2015 Forest River Surveyor. I was losing the battle. I noticed Bob Moses Ceramic Coating on a friends Facebook post, thanks Richard Hermanson Jeffries III...and started doing some research. I contacted Matt Moses, asked questions and got a price. I will tell you up front it's not a inexpensive process but, if you wax it yourself 3 or 4 times a year or have someone else do it you will end up in a losing battle like I was. I truly believe having Matt and his crew ceramic coat this camper saved its exterior. Look carefully at the before and after shots. In a perfect world a camper kept under cover should not oxidize like that after 3 years but it did. I was expecting good results. I got absolutely OUTSTANDING results. Heck, they even coated the AC cover and TV antenna on the roof.. They look great and the awning motor covers...wow! They do protection more than restoration but in my case I got the best of both. Thank you Matt Moses and the crew at Bob Moses Ceramic Coating for the great work and peace of mind knowing my rig looks the best it can and will for a long time. I highly recommend this process and invite anyone to ask me questions. Hell, I'll even show it off if you would like to see it in person."
5,5,I got my sandstorm coated and it was the best thing I have ever done.  It sits in a gravel/dirt RV lot with lots of dust and direct exposure from the sun and storms.  Whenever I pick it up I give it a quick spray with the hose and it looks brand new again thanks to my Bob Moses Ceramic coating!
3.5,5,"Amazing staff. Nothing but the BEST. Pino, Joe and the wonderful lady that helped me when I came in were awesome. Look, I order parts all day long. I also know who can provide parts availability, part pricing that is good and awesome peoples. I feel spoiled, they give me all of that. Thanks, Brooke from Mattorro's"
5,5,Chad did an AMAZING job . I had a few rock chips on my front bumper and he painted the chips to match my OEM color perfectly. I can't even tell were they were. This is definitely my go to guy for paint and bumper repairs from now on!
5,5,"I had Chad from Touch Up Pro come to my house to fix some deep scratches in my rear bumper.  He showed up on time and he did a fabulous job.  I watched as he sanded out the scratches, primered, painted about 3 or 4 coats of paint, put on a clear coat, wet sanded and polished the bumper.  It took him about 3 hours doing all of this in my driveway.  So convenient.  The job he did is fabulous.  Beautiful job on my Audi.  Perfect match on the paint and the paint looks perfect.  I also had him do some touch up on rock chips and nicks on another car.  That car also looks great.  I highly recommend Touch Up Pro.  I will definitely hire him the next time I need work done."
5,5,"Chad is so awesome! He came on a short notice and fixed some deep scratches on my rental car for a great price with high quality, efficient work! I highly recommend Chad, and his services! Will always use him in the future!"
4,3,"Here is an update which I'll give it 3 stars since the episode regarding the mistake of adding a refrigerator instead of a freezer and losing all of our product has now been rectified. Ernie did send us the reimbursement
for the lost product, so for that I have to update my review. Have since learned that Jaimie is no longer with them, which is a good thing!"
4,1,"First and foremost, I'm not wring this review due to Ernie's workmanship, shop or product. I give Ernie an (A) on that level. Based on what I saw. This has to do with lack of communication with customers in regards to work being done on your Concession trailer. Ernie and I spent 45mins on phone going over every appliance, equipment and materials that was going to be installed in my trailer. Ernie quoted me a price and I continued shopping around because I FELT it was a little HIGH. A couple of days later I got a call from a co-worker asking me what happen because I never called back and I explain to co-worker how I felt about price,that it was high. I explained to co-worker I had a complete layout of trailer with everything I wanted installed on my trailer and for Ernie to look over it to see if he could give me a better price. Few hours passed, I got a call back, we agreed on a lower price of about 6000.00 dollars. I agreed to take my trailer to his shop on his new estimate. Ernie claimed my trailer would be worth 60k when he's done for a 40k job. I said Thank You! I live in California which is 377 miles away one way. I ask about a contract, Ernie claims he would have contract ready for me when I dropped trailer off. I agreed. Big MISTAKE. Next day I left for Arizona around 1:00pm, I explained to Ernie I wouldn't arrive until around 8:00pm, Ernie said no problem, he only lives 2 miles from shop and he would meet me there. I said cool, that's nice of him. On my way up I called Ernie when I was 30mins away, that I will be arriving soon, he explained to me he was still at shop, that he was leaving and to just drop trailer off in front of roll up door by his office. I felt very uncomfortable doing that and I ask Ernie if he would just wait at shop until I got there so I could meet him and pick up contract. I ask Ernie about contract, if it was ready, Ernie said no, Ernie ask me if tomorrow was ok, that he would send it to me via email, I said I will talk to you when I get there. I arrived about 8:15pm, we talked and he showed me around shop. Ernie showed me a trailer in which he posted on Facebook and sent to me via text showing me his workmanship and what I was getting in my trailer. While there looking at trailer he was completing, I ask about generator location on trailer, I ask if that's were he was putting my generator, Ernie's response was, you don't have a generator for your trailer, I said what, I sent you a complete layout with a generator in wish Ernie claims was (optional), I explained to Ernie optional met brand of generator, not with or without one like Ernie's theory, I mention to Ernie I couldn't operate a trailer without a generator, plus we talked about it on the phone in our first conversation, before I sent layout that I emailed to you. Plus if it was a concern, why didn't Ernie ask me about it before giving me a price, I know why, he knew we talked about it already over phone. That's when the fun begins and price skyrockets like the shuttle going to mars. That would be an additional 5-7k on price quote. I was like wtf happening here, I started asking Ernie questions about trailer he sent me via text, about the inside of trailer because I was very concern by now where this was heading, I ask Ernie if my trailer was going to looked like the inside of this trailer, he said no way, I said what, Ernie claims this is a 63-65k job, your only paying 40k, so I ask, what I'm I getting? He showed me a food truck with a 3 bay sink just standing, with plumbing and pipes showing, I said to myself, hell no, I'm not paying 40k for that shit.Ernie stated my trailer will not come with cabinets nowhere in my trailer, I'm thinking in my head, why would he send me a video with cabinets and all this fancy appliances in it and then claim he was installing equipment like the food truck he just showed me. If Ernie would of showed me that food truck from the beginning and appliances, I would of never ever driven to his place for that price. I ask how much to have cabinets installed in my trailer,10k more. I was like f that, now I'm looking at 55-57k, in which my very first estimate was 46k before dropping it down to 40k. I mentioned to Ernie I needed to talk to my wife about new price, we both decided not do the job with Ernie, so I hooked my trailer back up and drove back to California that night. What a lonely drive back with a very pissed off wife because I didn't get a contract before I went to Arizona. There's NO such thing about Meaning of the Minds anymore. What a waste of time, money and mileage on my new truck. So the THEORY of my review is, GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING & ON CONTRACT, COMPLETE DETAIL OF JOB and A COMPLETE ITEMIZED LIST of Parts and Appliances. Good Luck! BTW ERNIE....SHAME ON YOU!!!!! REMEMBER KARMA!"
4,5,When looking for a food truck or concession stand to build Ernie Miranda and his team at prime designs are the right people for the job! They had my trailer up to code and running within a month! Amazing job and we love our trailer! Thank you so much Ernie! Looking forward to doing business with you again on the next build!
4,5,"If you are looking to start your dream and build a food truck, there is nowhere else to go.  Everything they do is done with quality and professionalism.  Thank you so much guys for being supportive and answering any questions we may have.  You guys are the best!"
4,5,"Ernie and his team built our dream truck!
The customer service could not have been better. We are so happy with the final product and workmanship. They went over and above what I expected and will be returning to build our next truck without question.
Thanks guys!"
4,5,We've been coming here for new builds and remodels with both our food trucks and they do the absolute best work in the industry hands down and they are fast and affordable. I won't go to anyone else. - Mindy & Scott with Morning Kick
4,5,"My husband and I just had our first food truck built, and we are so happy that we chose Prime Design for the job! Being new to the business, we didn't know what to expect, but Ernie and his team took the time to explain everything thoroughly and were very responsive to answering all of our questions every step of the way. Not only are they great to work with, but they are experts in what they do, always paying attention to every detail. Ernie and his team went above and beyond what we expected. Our truck turned out beautiful! Thank you Prime Design for helping us make our dream come true!!!"
2,1,I bought my trailer new here they have maintained it for three years when I go to use my spare tire it was stolen and they put a used tire in its place. I believe these people are untrustworthy and they will steal your tire if it is good so please watch that
2,4,The gals here helped with our warranty issues on a previous trailer and with a delivery on our new trailer. We returned here due to the service felt! They are professional and have the needs of the buyer put first! On time as promised with no further issues! Will happily return.
2,1,"Absolutely horrible service. I paid them to inspect my RV - in particular the roof and slideout area for leaks (proactive service). As I was driving away with the RV, I noticed that the dome cover over the breeze fan in the bedroom was still cracked - this was something they were supposed to identify and repair (or at the very least identify this as an issue and make recommendations and provide repair cost if applicable). I elected to simply patch this item myself. Later, I found vent covers on the roof cracked (this should have been identified) and the slideout was missing several trim pieces and obviously leaking. None of these items were identified or even communicated. Basically, got charged a huge sum of money for absolutely nothing. Horrible experience."
3.5,4,"We have been searching for a reliable/dependable RV repair shop. Giant Eagle RV repair on Boulder Highway is the PLACE. They are very nice people and will fix anything on your RV. They say ""We'll fix anything related to Rv's"". Kathy Brandt is the lady to talk to and will make sure the job is done right. We just had our dash air conditioning leak fixed, Roof air conditioning fixed, lights fixed, step bracket fixed, Slide out fixed and much more and all was done to perfection. Hats off to Giant Eagle Repair and Kathy Brandt."
3.5,5,"Tom and his Crew did a wonderful job repairing our RV. Their Service exceeded our expectations by so much we plan on having them Service our RV next time we pass thru Las Vegas. If you need Service and it fixed right - expert diagnosis and HONEST folks - do business with Double Eagle RV Repair on Boulder Highway, couple miles south of Sam's Town. Thanks Tom, Kathy, Mario and Crew for the super nice work - explanation and education - great job - we really appreciated it."
3.5,5,"The most convenient service I have ever had.  We live in the Ely, NV area where temperatures regularly go below zero.  Apparently, we did not winterize well enough.  We were caught by surprise when we took our travel trailer to the KOA in Las Vegas and immediately sprung a sizable leak at the toilet.  We called a bunch of services and no one was available until Monday (it was Friday and we were leaving Monday).  We finally called Double Eagle after looking on Yelp.  One of their technicians, Randy, arrived in 20 minutes!  He diagnosed the leak within seconds and had the repair done about 15 minutes later.  About an hour after he left, we were headed out to dinner when we saw water coming from the belly of our trailer.  We called Double Eagle again and, again, Randy was there in 15-20 minutes.  He was able to diagnose our leaking water pump within about 10 minutes and upgraded us to a more reliable pump within 20-30 minutes.  Two days later, we had water coming from underneath our shower.  Randy once again saved the day by coming out, diagnosing, and repairing within 1 hour from the time of our phone call.  Randy:  you and Kathy kept my birthday weekend from being a disaster and I am eternally grateful for your service, obvious know-how, and superb customer service skills... THANK YOU!!!  And we blew the water out of our pipes with compressed air this time so we won't bust everything again.  Thanks for the tip Randy!

And as a final note, Double Eagle accepted our Xtra Ride warranty so we only paid our $100 deductible and were on our way  :-)   :-)"
3.5,5,"Thank goodness for Double Eagle. My folks and I were driving our 20 yr old Bounder home to Arizona, and  were coming down the grade into Las Vegas when our brakes came to the end of their service life. The brake pads started chewing into the rotors (metal to metal) by the time we reached the bottom of the hill. I was feeling pretty vulnerable to be 5 hrs from home and my trusted mechanics. We limped into an RV park where they recommended Double Eagle RV Repair.(It was only a mile away) I called Cathy, the manager, and set an appt for 9:30am. The service techs jumped right on it and actually showed us that just the front brakes were bad. The rears were still fine. Nick gave us the estimate with the price breakdown and ordered the parts. He said we would be back on the road about 3:00pm. 

At 2:00pm, Cathy called and told me we could pick it up at 2:20!

Being a woman, I am leery of mechanics and was ready for some ""extra"" parts or ""unanticipated"" issues, but this was not the case. Just the parts and labor as quoted. Yay!

The bonus for me was when Cathy and Tom said that if I was ever in the need for a second opinion about future repairs or parts needed for our RV, just shoot them an email and they would be happy to advise. 

I highly recommend them and would certainly return. I found them to be honest and personable."
3.5,5,After reading the other reviews I was hesitant to bring my RV here.  My experience was 5 star all the way.  They people are great and very friendly. They took care of a list of maintenance request and a couple problems I was having all with in the time promised.   I will be back.
4,5,"This was my first time and these guys were great. An Affordable honest mechanic that comes to you. I bought the parts online, he showed up and fixed the car in the exact time he estimated. I paid, he left and my car is much better. 

I didn't have to mess with rental cars, shuttle buses or missing any work. 

Thanks for the service!"
4,5,"Motor in the RV furnace has been slowly going out and these guys came out to swap it out.  Mobile Car DR came out and quickly did the work and gave us a discount for our charity, Run With Us America / 100 Mile Club.
Much gratitude to you guys."
4,5,"dave was just awesome great job quick and very thorough and i did not have to wait days i called and about and hour later he was here did everything we need i would totally recommend thanks again for the quick and excellent service work
ken & bubbles varrato"
4,5,5 STAR service with 5 STAR customer service. I called on a Friday morning to see if Mobile Car Dr could give me an estimate on front brakes and rotors with hopes they could get out to my house on Saturday. They came in with a bid $75 lower than a competitor AND were able to make it out the next afternoon. Tristan and his team were great and I will use them again!
4,5,"Really great company, Friendly and helpful! I received a quote from the dealership on needs &  service on my vehicle but of course it was outrageous and after I gave Mobile Car Dr a call and sent them over what I needed done they were able to come in hundreds of dollar cheaper for better service and quality work. I have to say my favorite part though is the fact he set up my appointment and was available to come to me and actually did the repairs and service right in the parking lot of my office before I had meeting and such to attend!! How amazing is that? I greatly them and will call back with any future needs as well"
4,5,I was referred to this company after a friend heard me griping about how much a local mechanic was going to charge for some brake repairs. I had a great experience with these guys.  Super professional from beginning to end.  Came to my work and fixed my car in just a couple of hours for a very reasonable amount.  I will use them in a heart beat for all future repairs.  The mobile aspect is ridiculously convenient.
4,1,"Called the number, rings twice and call ends. No voicemail or answer. Tried several times for several days. Reviews seemed nice, would of saved me a lot of stress trying to find a honest garage, but I guess I have to."
4,5,Jon at mobile car doctor saves my life and my cars on multiple occasions. Always there no matter what the problem and gives me the best deal imaginable. I recommend this company especially Jon in the East valley to everyone!!! Thank you for being reliable when so many other shops are not.
4,5,"The mechanic came out to my location right on time, and immediately​ began working on my car. Very friendly and made sure to make my worries went away and assured that my engine was okay. His name was David and I am sure I will use this service again any time I need repairs! The prices were also extremely reasonable and I highly recommend this mobile repair to anyone needing any work done to their car. Thank you again mobile repair doctor!"
4,5,"Our experience with Mobile Car Dr was a relief.  We had tried to have 2 other mechanics do the rv engine repair we needed, but they made the engine inoperable. The mechanic from Mobile Car Dr not only repaired the other guys' shoddy work, but also took the time to explain and show us what was wrong. We felt he was very trustworthy and we could tell he didn't want to leave until the engine was running as well as it could. We would highly recommend and will use them again in the future if needed."
5,5,"We are extremely satisfied with our custom built RV, GIZMO.  From our initial visit to completion, we were always treated very respectfully and professionally by all the team members.  We worked closely with the design team in order for GIZMO to accommodate our desires and needs. There was never any pressure from the team to do this or to do that, only suggestions at appropriate times during the custom build process.  

Advanced RV is definitely the leader in custom built ""B""  model RV's with new designs and technologies being added continuously.

An added bonus to us from our initial call to the present time is being able to call Advanced RV at any time during business hours and speaking with a 'live person' and never getting a recording."
5,5,"Mike, Marcia, and the entire crew at Advanced RV are simply the best there is when it comes to creating Class B RVs. We looked at Roadtrek and the Mercedes-Airstream collaboration, and they are very nice, but they cannot compare to the RVs built by Advanced RV. Unlike the others, ARV is completely custom. The process begins with a visit to the factory that can last days, as you work with the staff to select EVERYTHING in your custom RV. From the engine, suspension and mechanical details, all the way to the color schemes, floorings and fixtures, you and the ARV team customize each item in the RV. 

Once everything is selected, there is a constant flow of information from ARV to the customer, as they keep you up to date on their progress. If you have any questions, or there are any items that the craftsmen at ARV are not certain about, you can call them, or they will contact you. And you don't just leave a message. Everyone at ARV is available to talk to you about any question or concern you might have, and that includes Mike Neundorfer, the company's owner. 

We just took possession of our new ARV, ""Huginn,"" and are simply blown away with quality and level of workmanship. Everything is first rate. We took our new RV on a cross country road trip to return home, and even took her back into the mountains outside Santa Fe, NM. The road was narrow and rough, but there was almost none of the rattle, shake and clatter that I have come to associate with RV travel. On the freeways, the RV was so quiet it might as well have been a well made SUV.

We simply could not be happier with our new RV, and with the entire experience of working with Advanced RV.

Dirk & Amy"
3.5,2,Not very friendly staff and WiFi only works part of the time.  Our site is under water after what a Floridian calls a summer shower. No cable tv but good antenna reception. This is an ok location but everything is 20-30 minutes away.
3.5,4,Nice campground - pristine bathrooms (critical measurement) - nice pool - ample play areas - near the cheese store....only thing keeping this from a 5 star is the RV slabs are gravel and not concrete. (Lots of dirt to track inside)
3.5,1,My rating is based on being charged the full  nightly fee in spite of calling 24 hours in advance to cancel.  I am sure the site would have easily been filled by a drop in due the busy summer season.  I expected a $10 cancellation fee and was not told anything different when I had to cancel due to travel delays.  I typically book at KOA because of the service and ease of booking and the local family feel. I travel across the country a couple of times a year and this is the first time I have been charged a full night with advanced notice and this is one of the more expensive KOA's.
3.5,5,"What can I say?  I tend to choose the Koa as they tend to be the best for camping. That being said I was a little concerned by the close proximity to I90. That concern was quickly quashed. You were safely away from the road and couldn't even heard interstate noise. 

We arrived early by miss timing on our part. Terri and her crew were more than accommodating both at the start and after the stay was over. 

The gentlemen who piloted us to our spot was friendly and knowledgeable. The crew at the front desk were friendly and just talkative about the area and local events.  We were placed in a packed campground and although it was packed, we never felt like the neighbors were too close. The campsites were clean and well groomed. We saw the tent sites as well and they were very nice, some with shade even. 

The true test for us is the cleanliness of the bathrooms. When we tent camped we developed this need..clean bathrooms. Now that we RV it we require the same. This Koa was well above standards. Very very clean. The bathrooms had. Fresh and clean look and smell to them at all times. The only suggestion would be to add shower stalls to both the men's and the ladies. The campground appears very popular and we had to wait, albeit a short time, for a stall to shower in. 

As we walked thru the grounds we notice the workers stopping by and checking in on sites to ensure all needs were met. That's a great touch. 

We did wish the wifi was a little stronger as we did have business to accomplish when in the camper. 

If you are traveling they here make sure u stop to camp. This spot deserves every award KOA would give out. Prost!"
3.5,4,"Very nice campground, clean bathrooms, pleasant and helpful staff, great water pressure, and very conveniently located. The only issue for me was it was so close to the interstate that it was very noisy and the light from the nearby restaurants was very bright."
3,1,"The husband and wife duo running this operation are very rude. Twice in one visit they told me giving away free advice doesn't make them any money. Normally I'm all about supporting small, local businesses, but in this case, the big guys will win my future sales. Little did they know we are part of a local group of rv enthusiasts and this experience will be conveyed to as many people as will listen. 

Will not recommend to my friends and family."
3,1,"I was very disappointed in the assistance (or lack of assistance) I received from Al's RV service.    I had the need to have repair work done on my Carefree awning for my 2009 Monaco Camelot.   It got damaged going down the road in high winds.   The arms and canopy need to be replaced.   I talked with Ralph in parts and we discussed proceeding until he talked with the owner who said he didn't want to work on it.   Why, I don't know other than he said no.    Yet, they advertise on their website  that they do installation and repair for Carefree awnings.  In my case I guess that doesn't apply.   So, I will find another RV repair facility to take care of it and not do any business in the future with Al's.  I don't find them friendly and interested in helping take care of my RV."
3,1,I called the number and the person that answered the phone was the most unprofessional piece of crap I've ever heard I actually said wow and then said I think I'll just hang up. Actually I said that was real professional... I think I'll just hang up
3,4,"This is a very good place to get RV supplies and some boating supplies too (they share many of the same parts when it comes to the cabin area).  Service is friendly and they always have people available to help.  I'm actually surprised at how much staff is always around, usually 2-3 people at the checkout and walking around the store, and another at the parts counter.

The stock and inventory is very good, with lots of options on all the basics you need for RV maintenance and upgrades.  Pricing is decent, usually lower than places like Camping World which are just insanely expensive.  Not quite as cheap as online, but not terribly far from it either.  Since they provide good, knowledgeable help and service it's worth it."
3,1,"I went to Als today for the first time as i needed a new regulator and hose to replace mine that are broken and no longer made, so i have no idea what i need since everything is so new, so i ask the guy ""im looking for a regulator..."" and thats when i was cut off and told behind you and down the isle, so i thought well, maybe i can figure this out and of course i couldn't so i went back and showed him a picture of what i have for a regulator, he quickly says that i need a dual regulator, which i dont because i put my tank away after i leave so the cows dont damage it and i only switch tanks once a year and dont keep 2 tanks full at a time.. he wasn't listening and he sent me back down the isle by myself to look stupid, so I did for a few minutes and pretending I knew what I was doing.. Thats when i left this store with 3 unwilling to help employees and i was the only customer there at 2:30 in the afternoon. They just lost customer and thousands of dollars. How aweful! Avoid at all costs! Drive to mesa!"
3,5,I couldn't remember how many years I've been coming to Al's RV. I have yet to have a bad experience. They have been helpful and friendly and gone out of their way to help me. The only thing I can say is some people you will never make happy. You can only feel sorry for them.
2.5,2,"First of all, Paradise RV Resort is not a RV resort; it is a mobile home development. Of the roughly 950 spaces, only about 150 are for transient RVs. I suspect these will disappear as they are sold to permanent residents.

The remaining 800 spaces are occupied by permanent single-wide mobile homes.

What does this mean?

- Very dense living

- No green space in the RV spaces

- No picnic table on the site

- Only a single central building with showers and toilets and few of them

- No cable TV for RVs

- WiFi is very spotty. I think I am now using a permanent resident's unsecured WiFi connection. Thanks.

Otherwise

- The staff is helpful and friendly

- There is a large pool, several excellent tennis courts, saunas, a computer room, library and many other amenities.

- Over the air television is excellent

- There are many scheduled events

- Age 55 and over; no children

Just know you won't be among fellow RVers."
2.5,5,"I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I think one thing should be considered when starting here... this is not a campground.  It is a mix of permanent park trailers and RV pads.

We stayed in May 2017 and most of the snowbirds have flown the coupe so the place is pretty quite.  Which I loved!  Those that still remain on premise always smile and wave hello.  Staff is friendly. Security was patrolling on a regular basis. 

The pool is huge and warm. There is a large hot tub (Although it was way too hot outside for me to enjoy).  They have pool noodles and aqua weights to workout with. There is a great gym and a smaller hot tub. 

There's lawn bowling and tennis courts. A tranquil pond with koi and a small for bridge.

Also there is a dog owner section and a pet free zone.. Which I'm kinda partial to.

Early mornings and at dusk you can see bunnies going about. The full timers in the park have some beautiful setups in their yards and you can tell they take great pride in their desert theme yard paraphernalia.

Overnight rates for RV'S are fair and come with many amenities! If it wasn't so hot, I could see myself retiring in a place like this!"
3,1,I have lived in this park for a couple of years.  First off the Park Manager is rude and does not know the first thing about customer service.  We have water interruption without any notification and sometimes the water is off for days.  They turn off the whole park.  The homeowners are responsible to pay for all the parks palm trees which they $25 per tree overcharge and put the money in there pockets. The residents raised money because the park would not pay to put new felt on the pool table.  Park is old outdated.  Most of the residents are nice however Management last year let a man in who started killing the pets in the park- the Manager did nothing about it and he is still here.
3,4,They were very helpful in finding me a trailer and getting me through the purchase process.  I had some difficulty with the previous owner getting rid of some of his furniture and the ladies in the front office resolved it for me.
3,5,"BrentWood Southern Mobile Home Park, is our New Home, My Husband and I just moved in on November 1, 2016. 
We Love it Here!!!! Everyone is so nice and friendly. We have 2 pools, 1 indoor, 1 outdoor,
They have a Billiards Room, A Library with internet and copy machines, They have a shuffle board court, They have places to wash your car, and even air for your tires. It is like a little City.
They have Parties, and get to gathers weekly....
The best thing about this Park, is if YOU want to join in, YOU are Welcome too, If not, that's O.K. too. YOU can be left Alone. That's the Magic Here!!!
I would recommend this PARK, to anyone wanting to feel like Home.... This is the Place to be!!!!"
5,5,"Found H & S Auto on Yelp and gave them a shot due to their positive reviews and location. Needed a diagnosis on my Dodge Ram. Dropped it off late afternoon and received a call back an hr later to tell me the news. Rear differential problems ( which they dont do but did refer me to another shop). Also tested my battery on my way out the door cuz I forgot about to ask earlier. Tested good but John tightened my cables which had given me problems before. No charge for any of it. Great, prompt, friendly service here means I'll be back with future work to be done. Thumbs up to H & S Auto."
5,5,"Our poor little Saturn has seen better days. The starter is an on going escapade for us. And probably will continue to be one. 

Our starter shit the bed. Again. This time we took it to H & S per a relatives recommendation. Glad we did. These guys were nice and straight forward. Life time warranty on the work done and they did an oil change for free. 

Its hard finding decent mechanics. We've been to Pep Boys, Whiteys in Scottsdale, and even GMC in Chandler. They've all raped our wallets and never gave us a decent answer. Hopefully we can continue to come here for our future auto needs."
5,5,Today I am grateful for cold ac in my vehicle and H&S Automotive! I would definitely recommend them to my Friends and Family! They even went above and beyond and picked up my vehicle from my house to make it more convenient for me! John was a pleasure to work with! Thank you so much!
3,5,"We purchased a Northwood Fox Mountain in March of this year and it was a very good experience. Mike Turner was our salesman and he was extremely helpful and responsive - Brian too! We had a few minor warranty issues which they just finished up and we got our trailer back before the date it was promised. Mike Royce was the service advisor and was excellent. Cody in the parts department along with the parts manager were also extremely helpful - sorry, I don't remember her name! I would definitely recommend Desert Autoplex. Terry & Diane Brown"
3,5,We were extremely pleased with the professional help that we received from a sales man named Randy Compton. He gave us a prompt reply with our request to find the Motorhome that would meet all of our needs. He answered all of our questions including the super technical ones my engineer husband always asks!!! The day that we drove from Prescott to Mesa to look for RV's it was 115 outside but that didn't stop Randy from taking us out for test drive even when the Motorhome that we wanted to test had an air conditioner problem. He patiently instructed us both on how to make right and left hand turns until we felt confident.  We really appreciated his ability to know  almost everything about RV's. He obviously has a lot of experience but he doesn't make you feel stupid with any question we asked. I also love his personable demeanor no high pressure type salesman!!! We highly recommend Randy as the guy to find you the right RV.
3,1,"This is possibly the worst place to have your Airstream warranty work done. We are living in our 2015 19 ft International this winter. We had some minor repairs we wanted done after 5 months on the road- closet hinge, door adjustment and most importantly hitch motor problem. We called explained our situation and were told to bring it in so technician could look at it. We spoke with Jill who said she would check w/ Airstream on warranty issues & we made an appt to bring the trailer back in 3 weeks to leave it for a week. We called a week later and Jill assured us they could finish the job. We took it in on 12/19 appt. date. Jill wasn't in & no one could find our info- enter Chase who went over in detail everything we needed done-put info in computer because he couldn't find Jill's notes. We added a Wash & wax detail @ agreed on price. When we returned a week later NOTHING had been done- Chase was out and Jill said she didn't know anything about our work order, couldn't find the keys and didn't know where the trailer was. We finally got the keys and trailer and left post haste!! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT go there for repairs."
3,2,"We actually got to pick up our trailer on August 29th, One Item needing repaired originally was the power awning not retracting in fully without pushing on the one end. we were told fairly right away that the fabric was not square and that was what was causing the problem, so they would need to replace the fabric and that was a lot of the delay on returning our unit, palomino originally agreed to repair under warranty, then changed it to the awning manufacturer needed to repair under their warranty. To make long story short, the fabric was finally replaced, Not to the original Fabric but to a cheaper vinyl like material, the problem now is When rolled up to the road travel position, it is so wrinkled and loose fitting that a possible strong wind (in my opinion) could cause damage. The Service Rep. Martin has been very helpful in trying to right the situation, We are Not personally blaming Martin or the service staff. Also, When picking up our unit that day, It was explained to us, it is not actually their policy to hold the unit there until it is actually repaired, Martin didn't realize it would take so long, if he had, he would have told us to take it home until he received the parts. In either case 2 months for obtaining a replacement cd player, awning fabric, and a roll of wood trim covering from the manufacturer and 2 other repairs was excessive. We are however feeling very disappointed in the handling of the situation between the owner of desert autoplex (whom we have not heard from) and palomino (whom we have also not heard from). We feel like we have made a very bad mistake in our purchase. With Exception to The awning repair (which is still not correctly repaired) , all other items seem to have been corrected."
3,5,"Desert Autoplex has been around since the late nineties when they started out in Scottsdale where I bought my Bmw 3-series convertible. They advanced into being an RV dealer including taking on several new lines of trailers including Airstream and they have a huge selection of motorhomes including Newmar. I bought my first RV ever from them last month, an amazing class C by Forest River powered by the Mercedes diesel motor. We have already put on 5,000 miles and have  traveled several states. I just found out they have grown again in size and have now taken over a huge facility that used to house McMahons rv on main street just east of Gilbert road. I plan on only servicing my new baby at their expanded service center. They're now conveniently right next door to Camping World where I used to buy accessories for my pop-up trailer. Now I'm just waiting for their new accessories boutique store to open soon. Check out these guys if you're in the market. The sales staff is very pleasant and the owner is right by their side working and making everything flow perfectly smooth."
3,1,"Just had a horrible experience at Desertautoplex in Mesa 2260 E. Main. My husband and I went to look at the Newmar motor coach and was approached by guy with white hair and retro sunglasses. We wanted to view the interior of the coaches and they were all locked up. This guy didn't have a name tag on and his attitude was piss poor. In addition, he didn't even know the Newmar products very well. We can tell by his demeanor that he didn't want to help us and lacked professionalism. He opened two coaches reluctantly and even admitted they don't sell that many Newmars. Well guess what? It's probably his attitude. He didn't even walk in the coach with us. He just stood outside. This reminds me of a shady used car sales mentality. Either but now or you're wasting my time! You're better off going somewhere else. Both my husband and I work in public safety. We will be spreading the word!!"
3,5,"No pressure and informative sales persons.  Easy to work with fro sales to finance to service.  Worked hard to earn my business and I respect that.  Will definitely return for further purchases.  

First timer purchasing a class A was a difficult decision for me and this dealer worked with me to the deal was comfortable for me.

I cannot say that about their neighbor CW.  After several months of looking at many different RVs and visiting several dealers, this was one of a few that treated their customers with respect.  

They are busy and have a diverse inventory but are patient though negotiations. 

Honest to boot!"
3,1,"Another week has passed and still our unit is not repaired and No communication from owner of desertplex rv... I even called a number I found for warranty department at palomino subsidy of forest river who manufactured our unit, of course, had to leave a message, have I heard back from them..???? NO.... Beware of purchasing a unit from this dealer..."
3,1,"This place was a high pressure sales tactic. They also dont list prices and were trying to sell at much higher proces then we've seen elsewhere. If they ask you to come inside afterwards, dont do it!"
3,4,"There has been a lot of turnover in the service department at Desertautoplex which can lead to frustration as communications is a key principle for good customer service.  After my most recent trip, I dropped of my coach with a list of about a dozen items to be resolved. My new service writer, Tom, was very open and candid and promised to keep me informed. Tom kept his word and provided me with updates along the way.  I was also pleased the reasonable charges for some of the minor repairs. Because of Tom, I will return to this facility when I need service in the future."
3,1,"The level of service and professionalism of Desert Autoplex's service department wasn't great.  We purchased a brand new motorhome in June and immediately started having problems with issues that should have been caught during their initial inspection.  What followed was a nightmare from their service department.  Three trips to service and the things we need fixed under warranty were never addressed.  They blamed the facotry for not authorizing the changes so we called the factory directly and got them taken care of ourselves.  Nobody answers the phones, nobody calls back, and they don't do good work."
3,1,"We stopped by on Memorial Day to look at a few toy haulers we had our eye on. We are experienced buyers and we don't appreciate the run around. We made this very clear when we asked for numbers on one that we were very interested in. All we needed to know was how we all could walk away with a fair deal. We provided our current travel trailers information, explained we needed no discussion on loans as we already had our loan set up, and wanted to know what the lowest we could get the toy hauler for after this ""great sale"". We left for a quick lunch and asked them to call us when the numbers. As assumed, they did not call. We were really interested in the toy hauler so on our way home we decided to swing in and have my husband run in for the numbers while I stayed in the truck with the children. Some time passed and suddenly I see my husband walking out and Roy (the floor manager) with him. He stops and slaps this piece of paper in my husband's face and says ""I gave you your f***ing numbers"". My husband quickly gets in the truck and we leave and he gives me all the in between on the way home.

What a sleazy and shady dealership!  Even after he went in and clearly stated he wanted no run around and just numbers, the salesman stalled and waited for Roy. Tried to even convince my husband to come get me and our two children out of our truck to come in. Roy comes out saying how great of a deal they were going to give us...they got us $10k off! Apparently they don't plan on their customers checking the website and already knowing what the list price is. He offered us...the list price. No other rebates or discounts. My husband called him out on it and it pretty much went down hill. They also wanted to offer us $7k on an $18k travel trailer we had for trade. Not even car dealerships are that shady!

If you want to be disrespected and treated like a fool, this is the place for you. Roy will make sure to curse at you in front of your wife and children and try to make you out for a fool. If you want to be treated fairly and be respected, go somewhere else."
3,5,Absolutely outstanding service! It doesn't get any better than Desert Autoplex RV. Had an issue with trailer wiring and they were quick to diagnose the issue and get me on the road fast and efficiently. Thank you so much everyone.
3,3,"We had a super sales experience with Mike Turner on our 2017 Airstream in June17! However, our experience with the service department was far from shining. They have had a lot of turnover in employees in the dealership so Im going to wait and see how our next service encounter goes before I cast my final opinion. 
We had to persist on a warranty issue but alas, the owner of the dealership did the right thing by us. I've always said, when things go wrong you truly see what people are made of. 
The Airstream sales force is currently relocating to Scottsdale with a new Airstream division Manager, Ken Baker ( a great guy btw) I see this as an opportunity and have high hopes. Ill write more post next service! 12/20"
3,5,I have done business with Aaron Korges and Desert Autoplex RV for years.  They run a top notch organization and they aren't like most RV dealers.  They only sell the finest RVs with the best price!  I highly recommend Desert Autoplex RV to anyone looking for a quality RV!
3,2,"I have been here a couple times and the experience was  good until today 4/1/2017. My wife and I are pretty close to acquiring an Airstream. In an effort to determine affordability options I asked to speak their finance team to understand the term and rates available. 

Instead of getting a finance manager they sent the sales manager to speak with me. He told me I have to negotiate price before I can understand what available financing options are...and told me if I don't like them, "" then you can go to your own bank"" . I expressed my income range, told them I could provide them with the FICO score they needed to estimate my rates and term. As well as providing an estimated loan to value to work from. The sales manager wasn't polite and stated that they sell ""ten units daily"" and ""this is how we do it here""... I like Brian Knox the sales rep, he is great, so I'm not sure whether to still consider this facility anymore."
3,1,"Worst dealer for service, and the owner of this company doesn't seem to care about customers that have spent their hard earned money on a unit with problems that need resolved. The unit was built by forest river, at this point I wouldn't recommend that manufacture either, seems as if they don't want to send out warranty parts in a timely manner. If the owner of this company cared about customers after the sale and actually resolved issues after 2mos in for service it may make a difference, every time I ask to speak to him, am told by the Phone operator ""he's not in today"".. I'm fairly sure, I'm just being told that, because he doesn't want to deal with his dealership problems, just take the money and forget about customers.. we are so very sorry that we purchased our forest river product and that we used this dealer.."
3,5,"I've had my RV serviced here 3 times.  They do s stellar job!  Lori in Service is excellent at listening to what's wrong and questioning to verify understanding.  She's also on top of everything and gives timely updates as repairs are being completed. I bought my RV in Florida so, typically, we would expect to be put at the bottom of their list of customers.  Just the opposite is true - I'm treated as if I bought it there.  Lori is a winner - Desert Autoplex is lucky to have her."
3,1,"Worst service ever. They've now had my Airstream trailer for three months to fix nebulas issues. This is the3rd time we've had it in since we purchased it in August 2016. My family were intending to travel the US and live in it, but had to drastically alter our plans pending repairs. It's now April, with no word on when it will get done. I didn't spend $90K to have it in for maintenance for 3 friggin months (4 and a half total YTD); I'm beyond irritated. Don't buy anything from these guys, go elsewhere."
3,1,"BUYER BEWARE: Bought our 2016 trailer Mar, 11th 2018. We took it to RP in May everything went fine. Total of 8 hours drive time. Planned our second trip June 3rd, started out on the road at 12 pm and 1 blow out, changed to the spare.. so far so good until 2 hrs on 1-17 towards Cottonwood.. 2 MORE BLOWOUTS AND WE'RE STUCK ON THE ROAD WITH NO TIRES AND DOWN TO THE RIMS(which were ruined). One of the tires was wrapped around the axle..Had to get a recovery tow truck $700.00 to get off the road and to a tire shop in Prescott Valley. Our insurance advised to call DPS to get a recovery unit because they couldn't find a tow service that had the equipment to handle that big of a rig..  it took 5 hours to get our 32 ft 8000# trailer on the recovery flatbed. Arrived at the tire shop at 10 pm that night. Had to spend the night at a hotel. Purchased new tires, rims and caps. The tire shop had a heck of a time trying to remove the tire that was wrapped around the axle, they finished at 6 pm on 6-4. Went to DESERT AUTOPLEX 6-12-18 to see what they would do about the tires that blew out. TOM the unprofessional so called manager basically told us he didn't care and there is nothing they would do for us. I had pictures and wanted to show him but TOM said it didn't matter and again said he didn't care and he didn't want to see them.
It's the principal that the product they sold us they would not stand behind. One blowout I might understand but 3 in one day, they sold us a trailer with faulty tires over 3 years old.They said they inspected them but I'm 100% sure they did not, and if they did they just didn't care anyway. I realize it was a used trailer and Tom felt he had to remind us of that but that doesn't change the fact that the trailer had bad tires. Tom told us he didn't know what we hit or ran over, we advised if we ran over something we would have known it and come on.. 3 BLOWOUTS IN ONE DAY!! Tom never gave an apology or said at anytime sorry this happened to you.. NOTHING!! And yes we did raise our voices a little but that was after the disrespect TOM showed us, then he told us to leave his office and thank you! 
ANYONE: If your planning to buy anything from this dealer I highly recommend you have them change tires regardless. Manufactures put on the cheapest tires made in China. Better yet don't buy from them.. They will do and say anything to sell you something. Oh and one more thing Desert Autoplex has a F rating with the BBB, which I did file a complaint with them also."
3,1,"We purchased a Forest River XLR in Dec 2016  
New  We were thrilled as first time buyers 
Our sales person was very good BUT that's the end of good experience 
SERVICE DEPT not good and it was and continues to be a S--- Show 
When we initially arrived to pickup our unit for the walk thru, there was No one available to do the walk thru correctly so they scrambled and gave us this guy from service to ""to do walk thru"" who never informed us we needed to complete a form. Good thing, I took pictures and wrote down our own list of all VISIBLE issues there were a few things that needed to be repaired &/or fixed. MOST IMPORTANTLY  Still a 2x2 slash on the linoleum which is in the main walkway. (Looks like they tried to ""fix"" by gluing it not good ) But We were assured that there would be no problem as All was covered under warranty.    We discussed the apparent issues with service lady who entered info into ""system"" to place parts in order and would call us when they arrived and were approved by Forest River 
No one called , so we called DAP in late January 2017 arranged to come for our flooring, grab handle, refrigerator issue  & a repair for rattling from the brakes which was a warranty issue    
When we went to pickup Our unit the flooring was not ordered no grab handle, refrigerator issues not addressed but they  did ""fix"" our brakes which were warranty issue (later come to find out on a July trip that the brakes were not installed correctly! )  While going downhill in Northern California !!!!!!!! Dangerous!!!! 
we've tried to numerous times never returning call we still had not heard from DAP about the parts or service work needed. 
All of a sudden a random call that our flooring is in along with other parts !    We Made appointment to discuss lack of customer service and the seriousness of the improperly installed brakes while we were in hills of N California on vacation with GM Justin and FR Customer Service Rep Eric  I explained clearly our disappointment in their lack of customer service and service Dept. Told again the unit was under warranty, so issues would be fixed   We also gave the receipts and pictures for reiembursement for repairs done because of DAP service not installing brakes correctly   
No reiembursement as of yet!! Reluctantly We made  arrangements to take the unit in again assured it would be completely repaired within 1week. 
GM assured me we would be fixed and on the rode in 1 week (Aug2017)
When we returned to pick up only to have it WRONG FLOORING  so they could not install and very few items fixed( refrigerator still not working) Some parts "" ordered"" AND to TOP it off OUR TV and Honda generator STOLEN from their SECURED lot!!! Ours in 1 of several that had also been broken into mysteriously 

DAP did replace TV and Generator, Thks 

We left our unit again in their "" secured lot"" 
On the our planned holiday getaway weekend!

The saddest thing here is we have so many issues, not even mentioned on this post but DAP is aware of 
All could have been avoided if this business really cared about their customers who just spent a lot of $$$$$$  By follow-up calling customers back and fixing the problems!!! 
Sad reflection on Owner / GM and Forest River 
For those of you that just bought a unit here and are thrilled as we once were and gave them 5 stars BEWARE !  stay on them for your upcoming future repairs document everything even the unspoken promises 

We want our unit back FIXED!  
 My husband received a call "" correct floor in but it's gonna be a big project""  other parts in but not fixed! 
Why ?! cause it's gonna be a Long Holiday weekend!!!!! 
SO HERE WE SIT AT HOME ON A LONG Labor day weekend !!! Instead of enjoying our FR XLR To say that we will NEVER return to this dealership is an understatement. We have & will contact Forest River Rep with our concerns also, as I feel they need to know how their customers are NOT taken care of. So sad. I had to give one star so this would post. Otherwise if I could give negative stars I would have."
3.5,2,"We just purchased our travel trailer from them. The salesman was very knowledgeable and helpful and we were excited to move forward. The unit had water marks and streaks on the exterior which we were told many times would be cleaned off by their detailing crew that was the best in the valley. We agreed on price and terms and interest rate. So a week went by before we were scheduled to pick it up and during that time the interest rate jumped up by 1%, they were not able to clean the marks off the exterior and the salesman was no where to be found when we were leaving disappointed with our experience. Empty promises. Will not do that again."
3.5,1,"Consigned our toy hauler in April to them. The ""hype"" was it would be sold very soon. The contract was valid until end of July. No communication from them during the term of the contract. I did email and call several times to voice a concern the listed price was too high.  Received a call at the beginning of August to say several people were interested in the unit. No follow up on that, until I called to let them know we were taking the unit back. Then the cranky salesman complained they were trying their best to sell it. WRONG!!!.  They did not do their homework to find out about the specs on the unit. Would not recommend doing business with this company."
3.5,5,"Okay .... I get this crazy idea to buy an RV. I am retiring in 2 years and it's time to start getting ready for those 'golden years'. What a better way to tour the country and to see life for what it really is, than in a motorhome.

I must admit I knew nothing about motorhomes; absolutely nothing. When I first told my salesperson this breaking news, he told me not to worry, as I would know everything about them before I left their lot that day, and he didn't let me down. Within the hour, I had found what I felt to be the best motorhome value for the amount of money I wanted to spend. ""Let's do it"", I said.

Back to the sales office we went. I filled out the proper paperwork for financing hoping all would go well. Well, it didn't. Unfortunately, I have a hiccup from a couple of years ago, and I was not able to finance my new ""escape from reality"" motorhome.

So, why am I writing this review ?? I'm writing this review because I was very impressed by the way my salesperson, Flip Phillips treated me through this entire process. Flip asked great questions to find out exactly what type of vehicle I was looking for. He answered all of my questions, and helped me pick out my favorite without any sales pressure.

I would also like to thank Al, who is the Finance Manager, for going above and beyond what a normal vehicle lot would do to help a buyer get financed. Al did everything he could to get me approved, but it just was not meant to happen at this particular time. Al treated me with the utmost respect, and also offered generous advice about what I needed to do to make this purchase happen down the road.

I truly wish to thank both Flip and Al for their professionalism, but most of all, I'd like to thank them both for their people skills. I was totally impressed by the way I was treated.

Thanks again guys !! See you in a year !!"
3.5,1,"We purchased a RV from Rv Consignment Specialists, and I know we purchased it as it, but I can not believe the piece of crap they sold us. I will admit that they fixed some of the first found issues, but they did not tell us that this rv had a turbo, if they had we would have known something was terribly wrong with it. This motorhome left us stranded on a two lane mountain road. With no where to stop or turn around we did finally manage to putt to a stop and have it towed home for an enormous amount of money. Now we own a motorhome that needs a new engine. Thanks RV Consignment Specialist for ripping us off"
3.5,1,Kip thank you for your time. The main problem with this RV was the fact that we were told it did not have a turbo when in reality it did have a turbo but it was already going out. So when it did go out it kicked a rod. Now I own a RV that can't be used.
3.5,3,"This is for the service department: I needed to have a water pump installed. I had been doing remodeling on my motor home myself when I broke my leg. So although I would have been able to do the water pump myself, I had to take it in. I already had wired all the electrical and removed the old pump. I just needed someone who could get in the space while sitting on the floor to attach the wires and plug in the water hoses. Somehow this was a full hour of labor to connect a few hoses and their hourly rate is not cheap. But know I would be in a cast for 6+ weeks I didn't have much option. After it was done, I took a peek and I was really disappointed in the installation. It looked sloppy and wasn't even in the spot I asked for it to be. They put the new pump inside the drain pan on top of a scrap of wood 2x4. But it works so I at least gave it some stars since it functions. But I would not go back for service at Orangewood again."
3.5,1,"The service Dept needs a class on customer service.  I will NEVER go back there.  I had warranty work done on my furnace.  I explained to them I was looking for a good service center and asked if they could check my tire pressure while they had it.  The guy at the desk said he would have to charge me to check the air pressure. WRONG ANSWER !! You are a ""service center"".  It would have taken 2 minutes to check it.  
After picking it up, they put my thermostat on upside down.  I walked in and told them.  They sent a maintenance guy out who just flipped the cap around. The main piece was still upside down.  I took a picture from the internet and one from my trailer to compare them.  I walked BACK inside and showed them. The guy at the desk said I must have brought it in that way. I said NO !!  I have earlier pictures to confirm it. They put it on wrong.  The second time the guy from the service desk walked in the trailer, turn it right side up and walked out of the trailer.  All he said was ""two screws"" as if I should have fixed their mistake.  No apologies at all.  When working on other people's property, show some respect and treat it like it was you own."
3.5,5,"I have had work done at Orangewood RV on two occasions. One was roof vent covers to keep rain out. The other was a window awning. Both times everything was done just like it was promised.  The work was done on time, he prices seemed in line.  I will go back when I need something else done to my RV. I drive a Class A Diesel."
3.5,5,"The service and parts departments at Orangewood RV have won me over as a customer. The purchase and installation of my fifth wheel hitch and slide toppers could not have been a more positive experience. Orangewood offered competitive prices, did quality work, and finished the work quicker than expected. The parts and service staff members at Orangewood are competent, friendly, professional, and always willing to share their knowledge with customers."
3.5,5,"Very professional and friendly service center.  I had a new tile floor put in my coach, as well as having them paint my front cap.  They did an outstanding job!  The floor looks great and the front cap looks like new.  The paint is blended so well I can't tell where the new paint starts and ends."
3.5,5,"These folks are great! We are full time RVers who needed a Tiffin windshield. They were helpful, accommodating, & had spaces on site for us to be able to stay in the rig with power hooked up. They did all the insurance contact and ordered the glass, which arrived several days earlier than estimated. Very busy, both in sales & service, always a telling sign. We will definitely keep them in our ""RV service when in Arizona"" file..."
3.5,4,"There are some aspects we don't want to comment on therefore only four stars.  The things we were happy with were the sales manager Tony Bohanan, very very nice.  Also the technician who did all the repairs on our used unit we bought, Brett Y.  There were some glitches that could absolutely have been avoided which caused a lot of wasted time and frustration, therefore only four stars."
3.5,1,"My wife and i took our 2017 Thor  in to have service done also a satellite system put in.  We were given the last possible date that it would br ready because we were leaving on a Trip.  I called them the day before the trip to remind them and they hadn't even started the oil change...so apparently, they had to rush the oil change... When I got there to pick it up i asked to be shown how to work the dish.  I was given a very fast walk through but  with the TV off. I asked why the rv hadn't been washed, was told they were busy... The wash was part of the deal.....next day i got up and checked the tires there was a 30 lbs difference in the tires so they were not checked as I had asked ...With having the satellite hooked up in both the front and bedroom tv and told both were checked i don't see how that is possible when the wrong wires we hooked up to the bedroom tv and you couldn't get anything to it ....... I contacted Orangewood RV and was told i should have said something when I picked it up and I did but was ignored...I think they were into big of a hurry to get to their "" meeting ""  we watched the catering truck drop off a lot of food .....Corey J service manager at Orangewood now but was General sales manager at camping world when we bought it and stopped going to camping world and a new RV spent 90% of it first 4 months in for service...After thinking about everything they were supposed to do and didn't I'll stop on the road today and get another oil change, there were so many things they didn't do I wonder if the oil was really changed  ....."
3.5,5,Extremely helpful and knowledgeable staff that won't hesitate to go the extra mile. Excellent selection of parts and accessories that are displayed in a large clean well lit store.
3.5,1,"Purchased my first RV from Orangewood about 11 months ago. Experience with this company has been infuriating. My wife and I found that we do love going out in the RV so we have now traded in our original unit on a much bigger rig; but NOT with Orangewood. Had one good service experience with Orangewood; but overall from sales response once money was received to dealing with service and the timeliness of service the experience was very poor. Salesman actually lied to me initially but since it was a comparatively small variance of about $150 that would have caused a redoing of the finance work it was let go but not forgotten.  The General Manager got involved and did try to make things right but service continues to lack response. Wait time to get service scheduled is very slow but getting the actual work completed is even slower.  First reaction service has is to deny the issue, then to point the finger somewhere else if they can, and finally to threaten you with a cost that should be covered under terms of warranty.  To make it worse, all follow up communication had to be initiated by me.  It took way too much effort to get anything accomplished. 

Our first dealing with new company at the RV show with my trade in and purchase has been very positive and I sincerely hope they will provide a better customer experience than Orangewood."
3.5,5,"My husband Stan & I were on a trip & stopped at Orangewood RV to trade our motorhome in. We told them we wanted to get the deal closed that day so we could get back on the road the next morning. Ed Holden was our sales rep & he said ""no problem""! He worked with his team to come up with a price on the motorhome & trade, then put ""Captain Credit"" (Chandler Brown) on getting a loan approved in record time. We had the 2 motorhomes parked side by side & were able to move everything that evening. We were on the road by 9:00 the next morning. The entire staff were so helpful while we were waiting for the deal to close. Thank you for making this happen Orangewood RV! :)"
3.5,5,"There are many RV sales and service centers in the Phoenix area. It was difficult to find the right one for our needs. After careful consideration we selected Orangewood RV. When it comes to service it's the people that make the difference. In each department at Orangewood RV we encountered gracious employees exceeding our expectations. The paint & body shop did an excellent job on our coach. Their staff worked directly with our insurance company. We didn't have to do a thing. The parts store had a nice selection and a tentative staff. 
Our service required three days. Orangewood provided a free overnight spot in their lot with 50 amp service. The dump station and fresh water were on the premises nearby. They also had propane at only $1.99 a gallon.
If we are in the area and in need service we will surely stop by again.

3.5,5,"The People.  Yes they have sales, parts, service and a body shop, but it's the people that make the difference.  I have trusted them for years.  I understand they are a for-profit business, but the people I've met, up front and out back really care."
3.5,1,"No. Just no. The service department is terrible. Not only are they rude (the service manager actually) they will keep your rv for months!!!! While they fix minor issues. And make you do all the work for warranty, etc. Still waiting on the owner of Orangewood to call me back. I've heard you should go to Vans."
3.5,3,"Orangewood RV is a good place to checkout if you are buying a new or used rig.  We bought a used 2012 rig in October 2016 and had a mixed experience.  The following applies to that purchase: 

The Pro's:
Very nice people - I liked everyone I worked with.
Low pressure
Good selection
Very willing to work together to make a deal.
They fixed an electrical connection issue without being asked.
They promised the final prep would make sure everything needed would be made good.

The Con's
You must be good at finding problems.  Bring an expert if possible.

The ""Expert Walkthrough"" was not very expert, I knew more about our new rig than the expert.

Multiple problem issues were not fixed that a professional shop should have immediately seen and fixed.  i.e. I asked why there was black tar-like goo on the top of the (3) slide-outs of the four year old coach we purchased, and they said they would clean it.  After we took delivery, The goo came right back.  It turned out the topside rubber seals on all three slide-outs were very sun rotted, and made a major mess when the rubber broke down into a greasy tar-like substance.  Very bad.  Orangewood wanted big dollars to repair our 3 day old purchase, and could not get the new rubber material for 7 to 10 days, also at significant expense.

Other small things should have been caught by the Orangewood team, like most of the tank sensors did not work properly, and the power cord will connect but not thread onto the power socket.  Minor details, but again, caveat emptor.

Bottom line:
Nice people, but Caveat Emptor for sure.  
I have put several hundred dollars into repairing things that should not have been faulty, and I am still not finished bringing it back to where it should have been at delivery.  It is my own fault for not seeing them, however a professional shop could not have missed knowing they were there, and then they should have fixed them in the delivery prep, but they let it go to sale anyway."
3.5,5,"Our salesman Dave Roy was a pleasure to work with.  He was knowledgeable and took his time with us. In the end we purchased a Montana High Country. The RV was clean and ready to pick up when promised. Finance paperwork was handled quickly and professionally. No high pressure. A couple of repairs were needed and taken care of immediately. The entire staff has been very helpful. This is our 4th 5th wheel we have purchased over the years and Orangewood is by far the best dealership we have dealt with. 

We felt like they low balled us on the trade. So if you have a trade in this may not be the dealership for you. Do your research first."
3.5,1,"Orangewood RV has serious issues with customer service. The service dept spends more time trying to figure out how to charge you for work that shouldn't be chargeable, and less time actually doing good service work.
I took my trailer back in for some warranty work on the body, and asked them to fix the stereo which had never worked from day one. Was told I would have to buy a new one and pay for the service to install it. Low and behold, I have an extended plan, and when I proved it included the stereo, suddenly they could order me a new one, but I would have to put it in by myself or pay them. 
Battery was bad, they ordered a new one, and then charged me to install it. How do you charge me to install a new battery when the broken one came on the trailer when I bought it and was not functional?
When I first picked up the trailer I purchased some wasp/bee covers. They are supposed to take less than 5 minutes total to install. When I opened the package the springs used to attach them to the trailer were missing. So when we returned the trailer for the service we asked them to find the springs that should have been in the package and install them. They actually charged us 30 minutes or $60 to install them. Again, no more than 5 minutes, and they were already working the trailer. I would have done it myself had the springs been in the package that they sold me.
For the final straw on the camel's back:
I received a letter form the finance company they set me up with. Orangewood never sent them the title, and they are now threatening to repossess my trailer, that I have been paying for because they never got the title from Orangewood. 
If you want to buy an RV, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
3.5,5,"Orangewood RV staff greet you pleasantly when you come in or call. I did not have any interaction with the Sales team, but I was treated well by Parts and Services both. 

We purchased our Lippert 3 Season Doors for our Forest River XLR through Orangewood only to find out that our unit can't accommodate them (no fault on Orangewood RV's part, they  provided the VIN and the manufacturer shipped them anyway). This was very disappointing, as the Party deck our unit came with is pointless without the doors. The ORV tech (Rafael) and Anthony in Service said they thought they could custom fit them and they did it! The doors look great, the cost for install was reasonable and we are very happy with the doors.  Most other RV centers would have just left it with sending the doors back and sending us on our way, but the ORV team chose to gain another satisfied customer. 

The ONLY comment I can make for the team in Service is that you need to follow-up with customers more frequently (this is the key difference between ""just good enough"" & ""great"" customer service). 

I believe you will have a good experience if you choose Orangewood RV for service-just be proactive and clear in your communications with them. I have experienced service with many RV centers in the Valley and so far, I will continue to count on Orangewood RV for service. Stand-out team members in our experience there are Billy in Parts, Anthony and Rafael in Service and the Service Manager, Doug Kalich. Thanks again guys for making these doors work for us!"
3.5,5,"My husband and I deceided to buy a travel trailer to spend summers in Colorado. We came in on a Sunday, pretty close to cosing time.  Keith, our salesman showed us quite a few trailers fitting our needs. He was very patient and answered all our questions. He was very pleasant to work with. We bought a nice used trailer with his help. The price was right in our price range. We have been a Orangrwood customer for a long time and will continue to be! The service department is always there to help us! Thank you Orangewood! And a special thanks to Keith in the sales dept!"
3.5,2,"We went in on Memorial Day. They closed 2 hours early that day, so we got there with only 20 minutes left before closing. We came in and explained that we were looking for a pop up. The nice older woman at the front told us that they were already in the process of locking up, but She's send somerone out to unlock the pop ups. We got a chance to look at 2 but everything was locked up. We tried looking at other options but they too were locked up. 

What's frustrating is that right when we walked out, the guy locking up the units looked at us, then went right back to what he was doing. As we left there was a sales person lingering in the front office who asked us if we had any questions. I told him there were no questions because everything was locked up and we couldnt look inside. This lot missed 2 opportunities to open up a few units up for us, but they seriously dropped the ball. We will not be back to shop."
3.5,1,"I called in to ask a question about my rear air bag pressure.  I told Mike ( who for what reason is not there anymore) that I had the system checked for leaks 2 times and they found nothing, but my gauge drops occasionally and the warning buzzer goes off. Mike, said ""oh it is most likely a sensor bring it in"" I made an appt and brought it in. It set for over 2 weeks, they told me the appt was just to bring it in to get it into the ""rotation""??? Why make an appt??? When they finally got to it they saw the Fuel tank was on empty so the had to call me, well again I told MIKE! when i brought it in that the gauge did no work and the tank was full, guess what, I had to go back into the rotation.  Next they finally worked on it and did everything I had already had done, ran pressure check and checked for leaks, which I told them did not need to be done, The thing I found out is there are no sensors in the system, so I basically tied up my coach for weeks and paid undo cost to trouble shoot something I told them I knew, not to mention I was lied to about the sensors!!!"
3.5,5,"5 Stars!
We recently finished a purchase of a Grand Design Reflection 29RS 5th wheel from Orangewood RV. We also purchased a new slide hitch for our truck from their parts department. The salesperson, Mike, was excellent! He was very knowledgeable, no pressure, and communicative. The sales team, finance department, parts and service department are first rate. We will be back in the future!"
3.5,1,"Extremely bad service department.  Had RV in for 10 day before my issues were address.   Orangewood did not  correct items I requested to be fixed however they  found several items (much more expensive to repair--several thousands dollars more).  When approached about the repair, service man explained they only repair what is on the request--then why did they find the much more items to repair?   What a ripe off!"
3.5,5,We had a great experience.  They helped set up warranty  work as well as maintenence work to be completed in one day so it did not impact our visit to the Phoenix area.  We were very thrilled with their work and professionalism.  They helped get the warranty  work approved. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
3.5,5,"Bought a brand new Grand Design trailer from Orangewood RV. After using it for a couple trips like any new RV there was a short list of issues that needed to be fixed. Made an appointment to take it to their service department assuming the place I bought it from would take better care of me. Fast forward a month (yes a month for minor repairs) and they still have my trailer and not addressed a single thing. Each time I call I get a different story. They have told me they are waiting for authorization from Grand Design. I call GD and they tell me they have authorized it weeks ago. I have also been told they are waiting for parts to ship which a month later for some reason they are still not at the dealer. Very disappointed in the service at Orangewood. 

To add to the story. During my walk thru there were quite a few things not working such as water leaks under two sinks. Would have thought they would have checked these items before delivery of a brand new.


UPDATE:
THANK YOU Doug for addressing our issues and getting the unit back to us within the week. The shower fix is awesome and the workmanship that was done is top notch!  Also, thanks again for looking at the brakes with me and the follow up phone call."
3.5,1,"These guys are the worst. The service is non existent. Took my toy hauler here to get the fuel station pump released, under warranty. They kept my trailer for 7 weeks, and when I finally went to pick it up they made me pay for it, even though it was fully covered under the warranty they sold me. They stated that we could leave the trailer there until the warranty company processed the payment, or we had to pay if we wanted it back now, and they would send us the money back when the warranty company sent it. As it is hunting season, and my tags are only good for certain dates, I was out $500 dollars just to get my trailer back in time for hunting season. Thats money on top of the money they took from me for the extended warranty. 
The service rep even told me they didn't know that warranty company, so they can't say when I will get my money. How can you not know a company that you are reselling warranties for.
Do your self a favor and get root canal without novocaine, its a lot less painful.
These guys just don't care, they never return phone messages, and normally send your calls right to voice mail. So good luck."
3.5,1,"This review is on the sales department at Orangewood RV in Surprise AZ

When I walked into the RV sales office a gentleman welcomed me (i wish i could remember his name). I explained to him that I was currently in the market for a toy hauler that can be pulled by my ram 1500. He said that limits it to only a few but he would be happy to show them to me. He mentioned he was in finance and one of the sales people would find us when they were available.

So he started to show me the first trailer and Ed the sales guy shows up. He hands me off to Ed and we continue to look at the unit. I explained to Ed that i am looking for a trailer that can be pulled by my 1500 and i have a Class C to trade in. Ed said he understood and continued to show me a couple more units. The entire time i felt like i was bothering him with every question I asked so I stopped asking questions. After looking at the 4 units I decided which unit I wanted to go with so we walked back to the sales office to discuss numbers.

When we got the the sales office he handed me some basic paperwork to fill out. Once that was done he asked questions about my Class C that i wanted to trade in. During that time, another customer walked in and wanted Ed so he was sitting out in the waiting area waiting for Ed to finish with me. After that, i feel like this entire transaction sped up for no reason. 

After Ed took all of my information he looked up my trade. He told me Black book Wholesale was $42K even with the miles on the unit. He said current retail is $61K. Ed then went to 'talk to the boss'.

When Ed came back, he told me they will give me $28K for my unit, Charge me full MSRP ($40K) on the new unit and I needed to put down $18K. I was floored. My Class C is in awesome shape. Nothing wrong with it and they want to give me almost half of wholesale for it without even seeing it. Then, they won't discount the new unit even $1.00 (even though it's $6K off online (I found out after getting home and looking at the website) ). And on top of that, they tell me i need to put down $18,000 (almost half) of the new unit without even running my credit. When i asked if there was anything I could do he said no, that's what the numbers were and there was nothing he could do. 

Still being floored I shook his hand and just left. I am still in shock. How can a company like this offer nothing off of MSRP, give half of wholesale and require almost 50% down on a new unit and still be in business? I really think this had to do with the other customer waiting for Ed. I feel like I was rushed out the door for a bigger sale. 

Overall I am very disappointed in this business. I feel like I did something wrong to get treated like that but I can't figure out what it was."
3.5,1,"Surprise Police Department Report #170204895. Theft From Motor Home While Being Serviced At Orangewood RV.
WARNING! There was theft from our coach while it was being serviced at Orangewood RV in Surprise, Arizona. Six opioid prescriptions were stolen from cabinets and drawers. Rather than accept our concerns, there was complete denial on the part of Orangewood RV. Orangewood RV Center's General Manager, Brad Outcalt tried to brush it off by saying you may have left them at home in the garage. He stated that Orangewood RV had a drug testing program in place. He also added that they had a quality control program in place. 
Read This Before You Decide To Go To Orangewood RV.
Called for appointment spoke to a service advisor. Upon arrival, no reservation was found.
We came to Orangewood RV to service four items. It took 15 days to complete the work. After observing the business for 15 days, we could see deeper into the operation. As we observed the daily routine we could see organized chaos. Service advisors were being pulled in all directions. It appeared that they could not fully focus on one project or one customer; they were spread too thin. Customers waited for hours with few or no updates. It created frustration. Others in the customer waiting area vented their frustration to us and spoke of doing online reviews. Here is our list.
Technician installed a new rear AC and did not connect the condensation hose. 
Technician did not properly test operation for condensation before reinstalling cover plate. 
Technician did the work while on the customer's bed rather than put the slide out, really.
Results, a wet bed, and condensation being sucked up into the new electrical connections. 
Technician had to redo the installation. No quality control.
AC cover plate screws were now too loose. Mentioned this to the service advisor. He said ""you need 4 red plastic molly type inserts"". Customer had to find 4 plastic molly type inserts to properly secure the cover plate. After removing the cover several times the reply should have been, ""we caused the problem we will put 4 molly type inserts in for you"". No quality control.
Incorrect front roof vent installed in the salon. It required customer to stand on a stool every time to open and close the roof vent. Orangewood RV had to find another vent and redo the install. 
Mounting screws for the remote control could not be found. Customer used his own screws and mounted the remote himself. Did not want to wait on Orangewood RV any more. No quality control.
Had to ask twice for the operations booklet for the new roof vent.
Customer had to vacuum debris on the dash board after the windshield installation. No quality control.
Coach received a courtesy wash. Foot prints were still on the roof from the AC and roof vent installation. No quality control.
Customer had to wipe up the puddle on the dash board. No quality control.
Customer also had to clean the inside windshield of water streaks. No quality control.
Customer's carpets and floor were filthy with numerous foot prints on the carpet. No protective sheets or pads were used to prevent this. Customer washed the floor and vacuumed the carpet. Again, we did not want to wait on Orangewood RV. No quality control.
Customer had to use two Lysol wipes to clean the steering wheel of dirt and oil after service personnel drove the coach. No quality control.
Later when prescriptions were needed we noticed that a full bottle of cough medicine, Promethazine - Codeine 120ML was missing from the medicine cabinet. Also, missing from the bottom drawer in the bathroom were 5 prescriptions of Oxycodone and Hydrocodone. Three had about 20 pills each, and 2 others had about 10 pills each. Hence, the theft report shown above given to the Surprise Police Department.
Three months have passed since our first call. We have now made multiple calls to Orangewood RV management to express our concerns. We had a couple of returned calls with no progress. Orangewood management kept asking us to tell them what did we want them to do. We told them that Orangewood RV was their company not ours. It was up to them to determine an action plan, not us. We told them that it was like the tail wagging the dog. However, we did recommend drug testing of the service employees, employee performance monitoring for missed days or having to do re-works like the problems in our coach. We also recommended that they plant an opioid prescription in some of the RVs being serviced and check them after servicing. It has been more than a month since our last contact. As far as we know they have done nothing. 
This is how Orangewood RV treats their customers who have been robbed while their coach was in Orangewood's possession. Just let it drag on and hopefully the customer will go away.
If you had your RV serviced at Orangewood RV, you may want to check your prescriptions and valuables to see if they are still in your RV.

3.5,1,"My wife and i took our 2017 Thor  in to have service done also a satulite system put  in.  We were given  the last possible date that it would br ready because we were leaving on a Trip.  I called them the day before the trip to remind them and they hadn't even started the oil change...so apparently they had to rush the oil change.... When i got their to pick it up i asked to be shown how to work the dish.  i was given a very fast walk though but was to it word take to long with the TV on. I asked why the rv hadn't been washed , was told they were busy.... The wash was part of the deal.....next day i got up and checked the tires there was a 30 lbs difference in the  tires so they were not checked as i had asked ...With having the satulite hooked up in both the front and bedroom tv and told both were checked i don't see how that is possible  when the wrong wires we hooked up to the bedroom tv and you couldn't get nothing to it ....... I contacted Orangewood RV and was told i should have said something when i picked it up  and i did but was ingnored...I think they were in to big of a hurry to get to their "" meeting ""  we watched the catering truck drop off alot of food .....Corey J service manager  at Orangewood  now  but was General sales manager at camping world  when we brought  it  and stopped going to camping world and a new RV spent 90% of it first 4 months in for service...After thinging about everything they were suppose to do and didn't  i'll stop on the road today and get another oil change, there was so many things they didn't do i wonder if the oil was really changed  ....."
5,5,We recently bought a used Lance truck camper from the Tom's Camperland on Grand.  They are great!!  Kyle showed us the camper and we worked out all the details of the sale with him.  The service Dept (Saul & crew) did an excellent job of setting up out truck with the tie down system.  Saul took lots of time on our walk through and explained all the systems and answered all our questions.  We love our slide-in camper!  It's exactly what we wanted!  This a great shop and we highly recommend them!
5,4,"UPDATE:  We went back to correct the situation which they did quickly and even credited us for part of the service, which we didn't ask for.  Still,  there is no substitution for supervision. 

We went to Firebird for a 6 bolt rim for our 3 axel heavy duty trailer. We had brought in just the fire and rim. They said they had the rim and so we agreed to the service. When completed,  they put the new rimmed tire in the back of the my pick up truck locking bed along with the old rim. I didn't check it. I left it there until we were getting ready to leave with a load. It was a 5 bolt pattern rim. Good thing I have the old rim. I'm pissed. My trip is delayed. I have to go back to correct this. They are not close. They were recommended to us by Bell Road Rv. A mistake on a simple issue that cost me money in delays. Not a happy camper."
5,5,"I just ran into to Firebird to see if they can help with some tires for a 1977 School bus...of course they could. 

They gave me a heck of a deal and had it ready the next day."
5,5,Yesterday we had 6 tires replaced on our motorhome.  Even though we were late in arriving they got us right in.  The whole shop seems very professional and Tom gladly answered all our questions.  They had the right tires in stock and my husband thinks he notices it rides better.  We're very particular where we take our coach to have work done and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Firebird Tire to anyone.
5,5,These guys were great. We have a new Winnebago View that need new steel valve stems/extenders.  They know there stuff and were very informative. Tom behind the counter gave us some good information about our RV and the tire pressure needed.

5,2,"I went in to get a tire changed and balanceing of my two front . They charged me 75 bucks .I get down the road and notice that the drivers side does not have any weights on it so iI call them back and ask if they had to balance it they said ""No"", .I then asked why they charged me for something they did not do and the young guy Matt is his name rudely told me ""because we put it on the machine.to which i replied but you did not do any thing to it. I was promptly told if i did not like it to take it up with Paul. I will never go there again. completely ripped off by that place ."
5,5,"Had a dually air stem kit, rotation and inflation done on my rv tires. My rig was done in a couple of hours and no needless price gouging or insistence on purchasing upgrades. Everyone was professional and kind. Will use again and recommend."
5,5,"We  were traveling through in our RV and were having problems with two tires.  They took care of it promptly, reasonably and courteously.  They even arranged to have someone come and service our generator. Tom at the front desk was great.  Paul the owner took care of a minor glitch we had.  I would absolutely recommend them and would use them in the future."
5,5,"Excellent. They came to my house and replaced two tires on my camper. Fairly friendly service...it is a tire shop and not a beauty salon, after all. I'll use them again and will recommend them to anyone who asks."
3.5,4,We stayed for 2 weeks and enjoyed the park along with the fresh oranges from the trees. The only reason for 4 stars is this is the only RV park where we have ever had to pay for WIFI and we travel every winter all over the south. They do have a lot of people that live there year round or own a trailer home. Guessing that is why you pay for WIFI and a daily electric charge.
3.5,1,"I can't speak to the services but we were denied booking a campsite because we have 3 kids and they have a max of 4 people. I understand putting a max of 4 adults, but 2 adults and 3 kids? Sounds like a way to discriminate against families from staying at your RV park. Total BS"
3.5,5,"First impression...Office ladies are great!!! From the time I walked in, had a great vibe. Helpful, friendly and warm.  I travel all over the U.S. for my trade. I moved from Leaf Verde in Buckeye, along with a group of my co-workers, to Destiny and we are ALL  much happier here. Shade trees, beautiful pool/spa, courteous/professional staff. Happy Campers!!!"
3.5,5,"Love this place!!! New ownership/management...really working to do things right and make it great.  Met the onsite managers...Absolutely wonderful!!! We had one request, and they addressed it immediately!!!  HUGE workout room...RARE for an RV resort.  Awesome pool and hot tub.  Clean and very nice laundry room.  Pool table.  3 dog areas - 1 uncovered, 1 covered, and a dog run area with turf and tennis balls.  Putting green, pickle ball court, shuffleboard court.  Nice sites, level, clean, with grills and picnic tables.  Security and gate.  Staff seen all around cleaning, raking gravel, truly taking care of the community.  We initially came for a few days and decided to stay for our entire trip.  Looking forward to happy hour with entertainment before we leave.  Definitely hope to come back!!!"
3.5,4,"Stayed here for baseball spring training.
Price was fair
Place was clean
Staff was friendly
Close to Goodyear ball park.
Would stay here again."
3.5,3,"Looks like a nice place as far as the facility goes (that appears to be in the 4/5 star range) but we were only there one night. My biggest complaint was the electric pole was wired incorrectly and had reversed polarity and I specifically asked if we could park with our tow vehicle attached and was ASSURED we could - NOT! The spaces are not long enough and the night security guy said that all spaces were the same length - but that comment could have been because he gave our reserved spot away before we got there. Either way, I didn't see any spots long enough for a 36' motorhome towing a suburban. Won't be back for a stop-over as it was not an easy in and out."
3.5,1,"Terrible RV Resort. Some very strange characters living there. Not a safe park to be in. ""Resort"" is no longer. Not peaceful and ""resort"" has not been taken care of. Grounds are worn and pool is in disrepair. Spa and pool should not even be used. Beware of people taking photos of people in pool from upstairs window with foil on window. Very strange!!!! Used to be a nice resort...no longer."
3.5,5,"Beautiful park. Nice swimming pool/hot tub. Great spots with pull-throughs. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Laundry rom was conveniently near the pool so we did laundry while kids swam. Park office has a little store with VERY REASONABLY priced items, including ice. Had a rec room with book exchange and DVD's to view. Has Citrus trees throughout the park and are free for the picking. (Oranges, limes, grapefruit, lemon) My kids LOVED eating fresh oranges. If we weren't on a time crunch to get to CA, would've stayed here longer. One of the best parks we've ever camped at. Had everything we needed (a family of 6 with small kids) and more."
3.5,4,Says closes at 4:00 I called at 3:10 and they are already closed. I went ahead made a reservations online. When we got to the Resort thank god they had a security guard on duty or we wouldn't have been able to get in. How dumb is that. They take reservations online but close before their site says so. Anyway was a clean nice park pleasant people after the fact. Good amenities and pool. Need more trash cans and sewer hook up that isn't in the bushes lol. Besides the fact I would stay here again.
3.5,1,"A one star for us, WiFi and cable non-existent. No shade trees, only rocks and asphalt the entire resort, and I do realize it's Arizona but if your dogs are anything like ours, they do prefer a little bit of grass instead of only pebbles and rocks in the very very tiny so called dog run!"
3.5,1,"Not Recommended rental place. I reserved a van at 9am with a confirmation number, showed up early before my reserved time, but I got a van at 11am. They told me I was lucky that they have a van for me :-) because they're very busy especially this time a year. I waited for 2 hrs for a van that I had reserved before and I was lucky :-). The place was sketchy and trying very hard to get me purchase their insurance when I told them many times that I had a full insurance cover and show my insurance card. Too much hassle and headache to rent a van."
3.5,5,100% guaranteed satisfied with the car we rented. TERRI Z. Gave us good and very fast service. She's very proffesional and friendly.
3.5,5,"Everybody there was really nice, Grace was helpful and insightful and Maria was also very nice and helpful. I will definitely rent again at this location."
3.5,5,"Thanks to Richard, the whole transaction went smoothly, I was in and out with the van we rented, so I could continue my B-Day!!!! Will be back to rent one soon thanks"
3.5,5,"Richard was very helpful. Great customer service definitely come back! Christian and terry also helped me out a lot and they explained everything really well. It was fast and easy. 


I will be coming back I'm so glad to have been a customer with them I'm such a happy customer. Thank you so much! -wally"
3.5,5,"Terri Z is AWESOME!! This was my first rental with them, everything ran smoothly and customer service was great! Perfect van for our party of 4!"
3.5,1,Crooks. Dropped car off after hours with full tank. They charged $79 and said they put 15 gallons to fill up. Total fraud. Don't rent from them.
3.5,1,"Okay TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!
I called got transferred to reservations but the dumb broad connect me to another customer!!!!! I can't believe how unprofessional this company is so I called again she transferred me again and no one picked up and its BUSINESS HOURS!!!! Totally turned me off completely how can I trust a company if they can't even take a damn reservation!!!! SMDH!!! Don't rent here ! Get your shit together!!! And the voicemail on reservations is so unprofessional as well terrible !!! He was stuttering in the voice mail like the dude was stoned lmao terrible!!! 
Hired by rejects of society"
3.5,1,"Poor customer service, clerks had no personality!!! Rented a van on 6/27/13. Air wasn't working so we went to called to see if we could swap the van for one with air conditioning. This would not have been a problem had it not been 115 degrees outside. The clerks were not friendly about it, did not even apologize for the inconvenience! In fact, as the clerk prepared the paperwork to swap out the van, one of the other clerks said that the van that they were going to replace it with was not available at the moment because someone was putting fuel in it...seriously???? They had 10 other vans on the lot!!!! And no one else waiting in line??? So as we were unloading the old van for the new the clerk walks out and unlocks the new van that was siting there the whole time! What a joke! Think they just wanted to give us a hard time. Probably because we were a distraction to their texting or browsing the net on their cellphones on company time!  I didn't expect a grand service but decent service would have been nice. The guy that checked me out on 6/30/13 was okay, at least he asked me how everything went. Would not rent from this place in the future and I would not recommend to family or friends!!!"
3.5,1,"WORSE VAN RENTAL EXPERIENCE!!!
Waited for shuttle for 30mins, NOTHING!!! Decided to walk to the facility. Office has an OPEN lights on but no one inside. Tried calling them several times and nobody answers. WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
3.5,2,"Unexplainable amount of hidden fees. Rented a van for the weekend to get out of town and the website says ""unlimited mileage"". We get to the place and they tell us that doesn't apply to locals and we needed to read the terms & conditions, which is on a separate page of the email sent to me. I prepaid for insurance, they told us we need to buy extra insurance because of the added miles. My total for 3 days of renting the van came out to over $400 instead of the $120 I prepaid for. Never using this service again. The only good thing about this place was they held my reservation for 2 hours over the expired time of pick up. Other than that, thumbs down."
3.5,5,Cristian was helpful and the car we received was very clean! We rented the car (brand new) for 5 days.
3.5,5,"Awesome!!! 

That's my one word review for AVR van rentals. But, I'll say more. This place was busy at both pickup and drop off but the staff kept things moving smoothly and quickly. Hats off to both Cristian and Richard for getting us in and out fast!

But besides the excellent customer service, I also got the best deal in town on a 7 passenger. For comparison, at the time I booked our minivan, every other site wanted a minimum $1,000 for anything over 6 passengers. AVR price... less than half of that! Only $400 for the week! The van was clean and ran great. 

Also worth mentioning, I had added my wife as a second driver but quickly changed my mind when we got to the hotel and she let me know she had no intention of driving while on vacation. Quick phone call and she was removed from the bill. Love the flexibility at this place. 

I will DEFINITELY be renting from AVR again and will look for them in other cities, too. Don't overpay, go here! Easy to find right across from where the shuttle bus drops you off for the other rental guys (who charge more than double - I'll cross the street every time for $600 off!)."
3.5,5,We have had nothing but great service with AVR. Anytime we are in a pinch with our coach company AVR is there to help.  Sometimes even on a moments notice.  Our latest trip on 10/21 we rented for three days. We received a great price and great new van. We will definitely be back.
3.5,5,Shopped around and they had the best rate. Requested a newer model and they accommodated. I will be recommending this place to all my friends and family. AVR customer service was amazing. Everyone I spoke with was polite and helpful.  The van we rented was clean and proved to be a reliable ride during our California vacation.
3.5,5,"Christian was great! We rented a van for a full week,  it was brand new !! Customer services was excellent"
3.5,5,Cheap price for rent a van . And very good  service . I rent a van for Grand Canyon with my friends . Cristian help us a lot ! 6/14-16 3 days . My name is Peijie
3.5,5,"First time here at AVR, Marie was very friendly and professional, taking the time to explain my options and not at all pushing any add on items. Yet, still got me set up and on the way quick! Marie certainly sets the standard for excellent customer service!"
3.5,5,"5 stars for the price. The office is a little shabby and located a bit out of the way, but it is more than worth it for the great price you will get on a minivan. We've booked AVR several times, including in Los Angeles as well, and never had a problem with service. Come to think of it, we usually don't have to wait in line as long as at other car rental places either. Office location is the only downside to AVR, so just give yourself some extra time when picking up your van and dropping it off if you're heading to the airport."
3.5,5,"When I came to the avr car, K.maire help me a lot. Hope next time will come again to let her help me."
3.5,5,"Excellent and Superb Customer Service! Very user friendly website to book your rental in advance! Very easy to find location to pick up and super close to the freeway! Prices are very competitve and affordable!! I would like to give a shout out to Julius and Annie at the desk! They were both SUPER HELPFUL, ACCOMMODATING and NICE!! Lots of option that they offer you and not push for you to buy..they are very honest and up front with the prices! They are actually the very main reaaon that I will continue to do business with AVR!!!! Thank you guys!!!"
3.5,4,Not really sure why this place got such bad reviews. My experience was pretty good. 2014 van available when I arrived. It was properly cleaned and fuel. Customer service agent was friendly and informative. Rate was awesome. Deposit reversed 3 days after my after hours return. Wish I could give a half star because my only deduction is that it's located across the street from the big rental depot.
3.5,1,"I booked my car rental through a third party website and it advertised unlimited mileage. When I got there to pick up my rental car, I was informed that I would get only 500 miles because I was renting for only 2 days and would have to rent for 3 to be eligible for the unlimited mileage. Otherwise I would have to pay 19 cents per mile over the 500 mile limit if I paid ahead of time. If I pay afterwards, that fee would be 29 cents. An extra driver is $9 per day per extra driver. None of this was on the rental page of the site and I felt cheated out of money as well. Don't buy gas from here either! It's advertised as the cheapest in town but Costco had gas for way less. I'll give them credit for the really clean van but their location is also further than the other car rental building. The employees at the counters were very nice and friendly but the company's policies and hidden fees were really irritating."
3.5,5,"We had a great time. We upgraded the van because we wanted more comfortable seats. The check out process took some time but drop off was fast. The van worked fine, A/C was great. and everyone had a great time in Death Valley."
3.5,1,"One of the worse experiences with enterprise ever. I have been renting cars from them for years, and this by far was the worse. I rented a car to drive out to Vegas for a hockey tournament. Yes hockey.. this includes a TON of luggage, hockey equipment n gear. Driving into Vegas, the brakes make a very loud noise going downhill into state line
Everyone in the car wakes, saying what was that? So when we finally reach our destination in Las Vegas, we call enterprise and let them know what happen
Take it to any enterprise and switch it out they say... they will give you the same exact car they say... ummmm ever enterprise out here is out of cars.. not able to get the same car at any enterprise near me.
Off to the airport location we go.. we have plenty of cars here, just none that can go one way to California.
Well, we have this jeep ( downgrade) in size
Nothing is going to fit in this car... not half of what we brought  but this is all they could do for us. Will never ever rent from this crappy place again"
3.5,1,"Vans are below standard. Old & dirty. Customer service is horrible! Long wait. When returning car you have to line up in long line all over again. First & last time renting here. You are better off renting from bigger company with newer cars, better service & less waiting time!"
3.5,5,"I got there and i had a lot of help. One of the employees Cristian helped me. He was really helpful, and very polite. AVR is a great place for renting vans."
3.5,1,"Rented a cargo van for a couple hours and asked if I could park my car there. They told me no it would get towed but directed me to the McCarren remote lot for $15. Rented another cargo van and when I needed to add another day they charged an extra $25 ""extention fee"" the rates are advertised low but in reality they are the same price as Enterprise and more expensive if you need to extend your rental. I won't be renting from them again."
3.5,5,I rented a van on line for a family vacation.  I had a great experience. The staff called and confirmed my rental two days before my trip. Picked it up and only took about 10 minutes. Everyone was fantastic. Super nice and friendly. Upon return they even shuttled us across the street because of all our luggage. I would use them again. Thanks guys
3.5,1,"Be careful when you think that your reservation means that you have a guaranteed van. This company will overbook reservations and not have the vans when you arrive. Instead of owning up for their mistakes and making it right, they are trained to just push you off to another rental company who will likely charge a lot more money...

I had reserved a van for a family holiday dinner and arranged to pick the van up a couple hours before the dinner. After we arrived and checked in at the Las Vegas location to pick up the reserved van, the customer service rep informed us that they were all out of vans and couldn't accommodate our reservation. We were brushed off to another company who charged double the amount, making us late for the dinner and costing us way more money. This is completely unacceptable as we had a reservation and because AVR overbooked and was unapologetic didn't suffer any negative ramifications. This was a terrible experience and I will never use AVR again."
3.5,1,Does not even deserve a star for this rental company... got ripped off on site for offering prepaid gas and insurance coverage... came there and still cleaning our rentals took  hour and half wait and all the personnel seems like they don't know what their doing... everyone seems like they are running around not focusing on each customer...
3.5,5,"Rented mini van for a month. Pick up and drop off were seamless. Staff was great...very accommodating. Van was  in good shape.
Rate was half of other rental companies. My experience was great. No hidden charges. Very pleased."
3.5,5,First rent a car service and everything went well. K. Marie was very helpful; she presented good and professional customer service to us.
3.5,1,"Do not rent from these crooks!  
I needed a van last minute for my business during x-mas and the rate was $252 -understandable.  I was told by the agent any other time the rate would be $60/day.  A week later I called again to inquire on the same van and it was quoted at $82/day with insurance- ok fair enough.  I got approval from my boss the next day and went to reserve it and the rate was now $130/day!  What the heck!!!!  We were told it would be a fixed cost, especially if we rented from them more than once a month.  Now we are told by the manager, it is 8 times a month minimum to get the corporate rate.  The manager told me I don't have to rent from them.  Thanks for your permission, manager!!"
3.5,5,Working with Andrew and his team at AVR has been fantastic.  I have used AVR multiple times now and will be a loyal customer moving forward with their competitive rates and clean vehicles.
3.5,1,"this was accidentally originally posted under the Los Angeles location but is from back in March of 2014.

After making the original reservation we called to change the driver name and make the pick up a day earlier.  The name was changed but the pick up time was not so there was no van ready when we arrived.  They did scrounge up a Kia which was ""just cleaned"" in spite of the stained back seat.  I suppose I should have been grateful for anything at that point is the impression I got from the lackluster staff. 

They told us the van would be ready the next day but when I called the next day they were not going to have anything until 1-3pm, in fairness because that was when our 2nd half of the group was getting In I told them, however you would think they could have worked out something to accommodate the people who had been so inconvenienced. 

Every phone call made was met with attitude and the feeling that I was the one being a PITA in spite of my best efforts never to raise my voice and merely express my discontent with the service.  

Just in the roughly 45 min it took to get the Kia while I waited I couldn't help but over hear customer conversations where they were telling people they were late getting vans back.  They told customers they would report the car as stolen, in spite of the customers telling them they had called the other day to extend the rental.  Clearly this is a dysfunctional company working out of a barred-winnowed-­makeshift-office.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Rent a couple of Tahoe's from Avis or Hertz because even though it's priced right here, ya get what ya pay for! 

9/18/14 - 
it should be noted that while the original post resulted in an immediate call from the LA branch to try and resolve the issue.  They told me someone from the Vegas branch would be in touch with me, this NEVER happened..we are now 6-7 months later, which is why when I reposted I reduced this from 2 to 1 star."
3.5,5,We needed a mini van for a trip to CA. AVR had the best rate. K. Marie helped us out with our reservation. She was very helpful and friendly. She even threw in WiFi for free.
3.5,1,"If I could rate this zero stars I would. We encountered mechanical issues with our van that we rented and when we called my phone call went to the call center. I was told that they were bringing us a replacement vehicle and I ended up on hold for over an hour they tried to tell me to go to ""pep boys"" to see if we can get the van fixed rather than send someone with a replacement vehicle when it was the transmission that went out on the van. They told me that someone were on their way and that they were going to call and they never did, then I called and spoke to the manager Maria and she told me she would call me back - but when she hadn't called after 45 minutes I called the office and they told me that she had left for the day. I then got put through to a woman named Mona who was extremely rude and hung up on me. I waited from 7 o'clock at night until 1230 in the morning stranded with someone who is handicapped and a nine-month-old baby and they didn't seem to care. I had to incur the expense of renting a hotel room and also I was on able to pick my relatives up at the airport which was the whole reason for the van rental. This resulted in us having to take taxis which of course was another expense that we should not have had to incurred.  The vehicles are poor quality, they are not maintained. The customer service is horrible. I do not recommend this company to anyone and in fact I am filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Because their lack of service and safety for the vehicle, it interrupted my trip and there was no remedy or offer to resolve the issue. 


Update - AVR responded that they were concerned and wanted to resolve the issue but never contacted me and don't return my calls. Again, all talk and no action, no follow through."
3.5,5,"Good service. Thanks Maria for superb customer service 
Only thing tho is that they dont have unlimited mileage. Over all efficiency and handling check out is great!"
3.5,1,"I highly do not recommand Airport Van Rental aka (AVR), they are the worst rental car I ever been too. I rented a van for me and my kids to go to California for four days to see their dying grandma and this people ruined my trip by giving me a older car that fall apart on my way there and than turn around and give me another car with NO power of anything. You know how hard is when you are a single mom with three little kids, and you have to go out to open the doors and close the doors every time you have to go out. Oh!!!!!and you just have to laugh at this....they ask me for a secure deposit for the car (which i understand), even though i pay the car full price online already. But what i don't understand is that they charge my debt card for this deposit ( which it was a little more then the total price of the rental), they will return to me in 5 business days, this what they told me after 3 business day that i didn't see my deposit back.
This people just made my day a little better every day.....NOT!! They are horrible...."
3.5,4,"I was also apprhensive since I too had read all the feedback on the hardsell on the extras. Just last week on 07/12/2015 I went equipped with all the proofs from my Discover card and my primary car insurer. Luckily none of those were needed, in 15 mins I was out with my 2015 Van and unto the Viva Las Vegas !"
3.5,1,"I wish I could give zero star. We reserved a 10 seat van on Priceline with unlimited miles, when I went to AVR to pick it up, they said they cant provide unlimited millage to local people!!! What?????"
3.5,5,Thanks to Socorro & the manager for giving great service & price on my upgraded van!  Great price & good service
3.5,5,"There was a mix up on my part with reservations and AVR was able to go in and fix it with no problem. In fact, they were able to commit to the lower rate for the bigger vehicle. Amazing company that is extremely helpful in fixing problems. 
The service rep that I talked to today was able to answer all questions, as well as give me pointers for specific areas to avoid future problems. I was able to hang up the phone with a sense of relief."
3.5,2,I booked a van with AVR because they were the best price for a van in Vegas. I can overlook the location (separate from Rental Cars building) but when I called for a shuttle my wife and I were picked up in a beat up passenger van and a young kid in his workout clothes. To add to my sub-par experience I was floored when the agent asked me to pay an extra $9/day for my spouse to have driving privileges. Experience left bad taste!!!
3.5,2,I thought we had a good rate until they added 35% for the 2nd driver at pickup. Will not use them again.
3.5,5,"Terri Z. Was very helpful and friendly and a happy person, been here few times in this place and has been always a pleasure to do business with them. Thanks to Marie and also."
3.5,4,"Few time a year, my church rents a van from AVR. Their price is very reasonable. However, I had a great experience, and I'd like to recognize a staff named Grace. I arrived there 7:00 am with my co-worker for picking up a van for retreat. Grace welcomed us with great smile. She was explaining every single detail and suggested to make a cooperate account which no one told me before. Also she was trying to find better van which a suitable for my usage. Usually they just showed a van and gave me a key.
However, my church began to use AVR for reasonable price and selections of van. But now I proudly recommend other church about AVR because of Grace. Thanks Grace!"
3.5,4,"Was pleasantly surprised by the service and quality of the vehicle (minivan) I received. It was clean, good engine power, and most importantly, great A/C! Will definitely return if I need an affordable, reliable vehicle in the future. Minor cons include: no USB charging ports, no Bluetooth for stereo, and the rental office is a half block away from the actual 'official' car rental area. Far from deal breakers though. Thanks Ace!"
3.5,5,"I had a quite good experience with AVR in the end of May for a family trip to grand canyon.  The price was good, the minivan was clean and the service agents there were nice.  It might be true that the system was too slow to print out the receipt when we returned the car but the lady who helped me to check out offered me the email print the next day.  And I didn't have any issue as other reviews said.  Honestly if I consider the long waiting time I should rate it a 4 star( because it did take more than 20 mins to check out) but considering the good rate and the nice agents I met it is a five star experience."
3.5,1,"Be conscious when doing business with this van rental company because the local staff will blame the call center reps for anything not right with your reservation. The local representative stating that they cannot guarantee a vehicle type that you've rented to even though your email confirmation states otherwise or has a nice new picture.

Also, the vans are in very poor repair torn seats, smelly , dings and dents all over including the roofs and sidewalls not quite sure if the vehicles even mechanically sound.

Local staff made all kinds of excuses and then referred me to whom I think is a supervisor by the name of Maria who tried to convince me or coerced me into a different van just because it was newer"
3.5,5,I had a great experience with AVR. I ended up going with this rental company because they had such wonderful prices.  I've actually never driven a mini van nor did I need one for myself and one other passenger but I just couldn't pass up the savings.  The dodge caravan drove better than my regular car at home. It was nice and clean and ready to go when I arrived. I will say the return process took a little longer than I had anticipated but they got the job done. I would certainly rent from them again.  Depending on how much you plan on driving it's probably cheaper and easier to just pre pay for the gas and return it with an empty tank. Just less of a hassle then trying to find a gas station in the area. (And they honestly aren't any close by.) they were great to work with when I called and needed to extend a day. They didn't charge me anything extra other than the extra day rents fee of $23. I will be using them again !
3.5,1,"Where do I start. We made a reservation and still had to wait like like 30 minutes because they said they had to clean the van. Really how is it not ready. They were also really slow.

Then she tells us she's gonna give us the nicest van. Oh great we thought. We walk outside toward the nicest one we saw, which wasn't all the fantastic either and she says oh no your rental is over here.  
We get over there the van is all scratched up, there was piece missing off the door. And the sliding door on the right side did not close properly."
3.5,5,"My company needed a large passenger van for some out of town workers. AVR has the best price. I was a little nervous because of the reviews I read online. It was such a great experience. The van was brand new, it didn't have even have license plates. When I dropped off the van Socorro was so helpful. I would definitely rent from AVR again."
3.5,5,AMAZING customer service! We accidentally left our property in the van we rented. So we contacted them on how to get it back. We kept setting up fedex pick ups which were failing because of our scheduling so the workers very kindly dropped the package off themselves! They had no obligation to do this but we very much appreciate it !
3.5,5,"Terri Z. Was very helpful and gave excellent customer service. Thank you for making my birthday special.  Go try AVR in Las Vegas. 
Kenya"
3.5,1,"Not very happy with this company.  Booked our rental on Expedia and prepaid for collision insurance.  Arrived at location to pick up our 15 passenger van and were told that insurance did not cover this vehicle and we would have to purchase MORE-- plus, the money we had already paid toward collision insurance to Expedia was not able to be used toward this higher amount and would have to be refunded by Expedia (which they did with no problem).  They also said they were going to place a $200 deposit hold on our credit card (which in the past I've only had happen when paying with a debit card), but that would be released upon return.

This van was rented for our stay in Las Vegas where there are a lot of parking garages... but most of them it doesn't fit in!  I guess that was our fault for not looking into it first before making the reservation.  Got that part figured out.

It's been 5 days since we returned the vehicle.  Finally saw the payment come out on our statement and guess what?  The $200 ""deposit"" charge was included!  When the rental location was contacted, my husband was told that it would take up to 7 days for that money to go back on our card.

Due to these things, I would NOT rent from this company again nor recommend them.  I'd rather go with a company that has higher rates than this one that has so many HIDDEN rates!"
3.5,1,"Never renting from here again. The office looks run down and sketchy and I should've known better when I went to pick up my rental that I should've cancelled and gone somewhere else, but I thought I'd give it a chance anyways. Big mistake.

The van we rented was a 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan. The agent kept emphasizing that it was brand new so it's in mint condition and it didn't even have license plates yet - it had the temporary registration taped to the windshield (which I thought was weird).

The van itself had no issues, but it was dirty. The inside had stains on the sides of the car and seats and was obviously not thoroughly cleaned before they rented it out to us. But we didn't mind because as long as the van got us from point A to point B and it wasn't disgusting, we were ok with.

But the main reason for this 1 star review is because after our rental period, we dropped off the car as agreed at 2 am the night it was due back - so it was after hours and we parked the van in the front of their office and dropped the keys in their after hours drop off box. This was Tuesday night. We noticed for the next couple of days that we hadn't been charged yet and thought it weird. On Friday, we got a call from them telling us the van has not been returned and asked us how long we planned on keeping it for. We immediately called them back to let them know when and how we returned it and they said they'd look for it. This went on all weekend, back and forth between me and a different agent and manager with each of them telling me the same thing each day that they'll look at their overflow and do the research and me telling them to look at their camera footage from that night to see that we dropped it off like we said so they could take the responsibility from us but none of them would do that. 

I finally decided to go to their office Monday morning and got to speak with the GM, Andrew Love, who had no idea what I was talking about because his agents and manager hadn't mentioned to him all weekend that they were missing a car. How responsible is that?! So I had to explain to the GM all over again what the situation was and told him to look at their camera footage and he told me they had GPS on all of their cars and could ping it to see where it's at, to which I thought why didn't they do that to begin with instead of hassling me all weekend?!

Eventually, Mr. Love called me Monday afternoon to let me know they got the GPS location of the van and found out where the car was. They probably rented it out to someone else before processing our return, which is what caused the entire situation to begin with.

Never renting from here again. This whole situation was a waste of time. The staff was very polite though and I appreciated the help from Katice and Andrew Love. Their manager Maria though told me she'd do the research on Sunday and let me know by Monday any updates, but when I called on Monday morning she wasn't even in the office and was off for the day, which is how I got to speak with the GM."
3.5,5,Had a grea experience with Cristian while renting a van. Highly recommend AVR as service and rental procedure was quick and easy.
3.5,5,"We had a pleasant experience with AVR. Julius was very friendly and helpful. He went above and beyond to make sure that we had the best experience. The weather was very cold, he even turned on the heater inside the van for us before delivering the car to us. Five stars services! Thank you Julius!"
3.5,1,"I was hesitant to rent from this place based on the bad reviews. Literally every other rental company didn't have a van, so I was basically stuck from renting from them. Overall the customer service was very good and so was the prices. My issues was with the vans. They are all dodge caravans and in horrible condition. The first van I got the ac was broke and beat up. They gave me another van and this time I was heading to California. I couldn't go over 60mph and it would shake if you went over."
3.5,1,"Rented a van through AVR using Expedia. Something I've done a million times, never had a bad experience...until AVR. They absolutely did NOT honor the terms and pricing that I booked on Expedia. When I asked then they said I should have gone to their site and read the terms and their pricing. While I've never done this (and it doesn't instruct to do so on Expedia when you read the ""company's terms and conditions"" that are specific to each company), I looked. It didn't have anything stating that what i booked on Expedia would not be valid or that they could change their prices for extra time etc at a whim. I had the Expedia rental email that gave pricing for additional hours or days and they would not honor it. They changed us $95 when the reservation said $25. I've tried calling customer service who said they can't help me and to call the local office. Did that, spoke to Maria who said she would investigate and call me back. This was March 25th. Guess who never called back...Maria!! POOR POOR customer service.

Our van was also dirty and had the previous renters (LAPD, copies of your badges and itenerary) information and paper work in the van...way to clean! 

NEVER again. While we were there March 18th. Another customer was having the same issue...so obviously this is their m.o. to make more money. ."
2.5,1,There are no electrical outlets for customers or overnight emergency breakdowns.  Worst Camping World ever.
2.5,1,"Do not buy from them. We bought a 2016 Coleman camper, and we're on our 3rd computer board for the furnace. They don't stand behind their products. They don't make it easy to get the camper in to fix it. They sent us to someone else to do the work who couldn't file the claim through our warranty. Now we have to work to get our claim paid. They sold us a lemon. I would never buy from them again."
2.5,5,"They are definitely as good as it gets!  We were traveling through Wisconsin in our Jayco Seneca this spring and one of the slides quit working.  We called ahead to Camping World and they worked us in.  The repair required us to stay overnight so they plugged our RV in and we spent the night.  They completed the repair by early afternoon the next day.  We were kept up to date with how things were going throughout the morning.  Very friendly staff and a big thank you to Joel in the service department and they guys in the shop.  We would highly recommend them.  Thanks Camping World, Lowell and Cindy Young"
2.5,5,"Traded in our Forest River R-Pod 179 / 20-footer for a new 2018 Heartland Mallard M26 / 32-footer at a Camping World in Byron, GA!
However, they completely mis-wired the Battery Disconnect Switch in Georgia, and once home to my guys at Camping World Madison, I got a complete ""REWIRE"" and ""RECHARGE"" from my brothers within hours.
Thanks to Justin Katz / Service Advisor and Dave / Service Tech for super fast, excellent work, to make things right!
They ROCK!!"
3,1,The worst!  The old man from the trailer was down right rude and the RV's didn't even appear to be cleaned. Most of them smelled musty & like animal urine. Very nasty.
3,5,"Bought my class B motorhome here, everyone was very friendly and informative. Got a great deal on a Rialta. I told him it looked like it could use new tires. And do you adjusted the price accordingly."
3,1,"They are underhanded crooks and their merchandise is fraudulently gotten thru the use of dishonest people. I believe that the Park and Sell is behind using these dishonest individuals. My advice, don't buy from them- it just allows them to stay in business!  By purchasing from them, you encourage the continuation of fraudulent behavior!"
3,5,New management very friendly and helpful
2.5,1,"I went through hell with this place.  Just know that if you buy an rv product from them, after the sale, good luck trying to get them to communicate with you. The ABSOLUTE Worst communication ever. This place only cares about the sale, and then you are on your own to get someone to help you with whatever your problems are.. I have never seen such a business in all my career. The owner is over his head and nobody under him gets communication from him. They are clueless at best. I feel for the staff. You've been warned. Bill"
2.5,3,"Purchased a 99 Winnebago Adventurer from their new location in Chandler on 5/16 and was excited to get a diesel pusher even though it was 19 years young it looked new! I drove 135 miles to see it. There was some differences in stuff that was said on the phone vs what I seen in person at the dealership. I was very disappointed that things where misquoted by Cris. But after 2 weeks of working with Ryan the owner they tried to correct some of the issues satisfactory to me. I would say that these guys do care but I think some employees think they're can say whatever they feel to get you in to purchase a used rv. In this day and age of social media this doesn't work. Remember to be honest to your customers and they will be loyal back and provide you with more customers by word of mouth. I truly hope that Ryan gets some of the bad apples out of his dealership before it's too late! Again I think Ryan can fix this issue! The service department guys also try hard to please their customers to. So please verify everything before driving long distance to purchase from Scottsdale RV! When at the dealership please don't make the same mistake I made! Please check everything before you sign on the dotted line. Verify RV mileage for your warranty! Do like Ronald Ragan would say ""trust but verify"".."
2.5,1,"Sure wanted to write a good review for this place, but have to be honest...I would not recommend buying an RV from this place and I would definitely never buy a Coachmen product again. We have only had our unit for two weeks and I'm going to get rid of it for something better! We took our Class C leprechaun out for the first time and had nothing but problems. Then the other problem with buying a unit out of state is that you will not find many local dealers willing to fix the problems that you will encounter... because you didn't buy it from them they won't help you! Another problem is that the buying process will go smooth with Scottsdale RV, but once you have the unit in front of your house you cannot get anything done by them. They don't know you any more. I will update my review soon with a link I will create so you can follow all the problems I have encountered. Hopefully it will save you from some of the grief we have experienced. 
Here are some of the problems we have encountered just in the first two weeks:
 - Can't get copies of our paperwork from the dealer.
 - Unit delivered with the stitching coming out of the seats, LED lights not working, GFI circuit keeps tripping off, awning coming off the side of the unit, Power mirrors don't work all the time, overspray everywhere, outside entertainment system not working, trim coming off everywhere, front end steering problems, and plenty of little issues I could live with if it were not for the big issues."
2.5,5,Unbeatable prices!  No hassle straight forward pricing.  Won't fined a better deal anywhere on their new coachman products
2.5,5,"This is my first time buying an RV and I couldn't be happier. I saw a 2017 model I wanted on their website for an unbelievable price, gave them a call, and they told me that that model had unfortunately sold but they would sell me a 2018 model at the same price. Scottsdale RV was beating other dealers prices by between $8-10K. I'm not entirely sure how they do it. They also gave me a great price on my trade in. My experience was excellent and if you're looking for an RV I would check this place out first."
2.5,1,"I really have no words to describe the service dept at Scottsdale RV.  I took my class A coach in for 6 repairs, all minor.  

We needed our AquaHot system repaired.  
We needed our AC fixed(it shut down prior to reaching the set temp)
We needed the motorized front shade fixed
We needed the central vac fixed
We needed a small hydraulic leak fixed
We needed the back-up beeper disconnected.

After 4 weeks they fixed exactly three of those items, the AquaHot, central vac and the Hydraulic leak.  However, the central vac was installed backwards so you can't access the side needed to change the bag.

They called me twice and said ""everything"" was done and to come pick it up.  When I did go, the ONLY thing fixed was the hydraulic leak.  That's it, one item.  The Aquahot system did not even turn on due to the way the tech put it back together.  He did it wrong AND he never even attempted to turn it on after the repair.  So at that point the only thing they had fixed was the hydraulic leak.

The coach is under a third party warranty and Scottsdale RV said they had worked with them before and it would be no problem.  This is lie #1.  I found out they had not.  Lie #2, they told me that the warranty company denied all of the repairs.  I called the warranty company and found out that was not true at all.  They were waiting on Scottsdale RV to give them more info about the needed repairs.  Later Ryan tells me that they were too hard to work with so he just quit trying.  Lies 3 & 4 were telling me that everything was done, twice.   

During the four weeks they had my coach, the communication was horrid.  I made 21 calls to them during that time.  The only reason I made that many calls is because they only returned my call twice.  Every time they said that Ryan would call me right back.  He never did, so after waiting the entire day or until the next day, I would have to call back.  My last couple of texts to Ryan explaining how badly things were going, have yet to even get a reply, let alone an apology(as of this review).  Feel free to contact me if you would like a screen shot of those texts.  In the end, they did not charge me for the three repairs they did.  I would estimate they had $300 in parts total.  However, not charging me hardly made up for the headache of dealing with them and now I still have three repairs I need to get done."
2.5,1,"I am done dealing with Scottsdale RV.  I bought a Coachmen Orion 20CB in August 2017.   Whenever I have needed to bring it in for service, I've had nothing but problems scheduling the visit.   Sure once you get an appointment, they will take care of you but scheduling is a nightmare.  The latest incident is why I am writing this review. I called on 7/30 and left a voice mail.  No response.  I called on 7/31 and spoke to Mercedes.  She said she would pass on my message to the service manager.  Again, no response.  I called back on 8/1 and spoke again to Mercedes.  She once again said she would give my message to the service manager.  It is now 8/2 and I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I don't know how they stay in business with such bad customer service.  I guess once you buy from them, they no longer care.   Go somewhere else to buy your re relational vehicle !!"
2.5,2,"I was really happy to get an RV I wanted for a great price. I upgraded and paid for a convection/microwave and was told it will be shipped later. 

PROS:
- The guys are really nice, they try to please you when you are actually talking face to face to them.
- They have great prices and give you decent amount for your trade-in
- The PDI showed an issue with the AC and they offered to put me in a hotel for a night since it took longer to fix than it expected

CONS
- Customer service and follow up is non-existent. You ask a question and they tell you they will find out and get back with you but you'll never hear back. Getting any solution, answer to your questions or solution is very difficult. It's not really an efficient place. 
- It's been over a month and my convection oven still has not arrived. When I ask about it, I get no answer. I still haven't gotten my title to register it. I am not sure what takes this long.
- My RV was delivered and driven nearly 2000 miles from IN to AZ and the muffler makes a loud resonating sound when you go faster than 50/hr. They didn't tell me this when I picked up my RV and I noticed it way later on the highway. This is really a Ford issue, but it would have been nice knowing about it, I would not have picked it up until it is fixed. Also all hub caps are crappy, making sounds, I had to take them off. I advise you to check your RV really well before picking it up and test drive it too."
2.5,5,"I was traveling 350 miles for a 2018 Coachmen Orion. I was dealing with Noah and Chris. Even though there were a few hiccups with the RV at first, BUT overall I am really happy with the service I got. They went above and beyond trying to please me. Then George answered all my technical questions. I got a great price on a brand new RV and they valued my trade-in based on the NADA wholesale value. Thank you guys!"
2.5,1,"We were at Scottsdale RV, in late February, discussing the new Coachman Leprechauns with salesman Cris, introduced who introduced himself as the sales manager.  During this discussion, he told us that the sales rep from Forest River was there that day.  After a lengthy discussion of what we wanted in a Leprechaun, Cris excused himself.  When he returned, he explained he had made a deal with the sales rep to bring in a Leprechaun slated to go to California for us if we were interested.  At this point, a sales agreement was written up by Cris on a plain sheet of paper because he explained that they had just moved the business to Chandler and were not totally prepared to generate a normal document.  We pointed out to Cris issues with our RV such as some exterior scratches and that there was a generator issue which turned out to be a 20 cent fuse.  He told us these issues were minor and could easily be corrected.  The sales agreement listed the trade in price of our RV, changes we needed in the Leprechaun and the total price to us.  He asked us to sell Scottsdale RV our RV so they could immediately start showing it to sell. We did so.  So at that point we no longer had a RV to use.  We were very emphatic that we needed this new RV by the first week in April as we were leaving for the summer.  We were told the RV was in the paint shop and would be shipped within 2 weeks.  After 3 weeks and not hearing from Cris, we called.  He did not answer the phone so we left a message.  Several phone calls later with no response from Cris, we drove to Scottsdale RV.  On this date, we spoke with Ryan, one of the owners.  He called Forest River and told us the RV just came out of the paint shop.  This was confusing as that was what we were told 3 weeks ago.  He told us he would send someone up that weekend to pick it up.  In the meanwhile Scottsdale RV is advertising our RV on the internet.   Two weeks lapsed without a call so we drove over again and as we were 5 minutes away from the dealership, Cris called to tell us the RV was there.  We did an inspection and found damages that would need to be repaired.  A week goes by and we call to find out that damaged parts have not been ordered nor have the double pane windows that we had ordered on the sales agreement.  We find out these parts cannot be received and installed until May.  We are now 3 weeks past promised delivery.  We are told parts would be ordered and shipped to a dealer near where we would be this summer and work would be done under warranty.  I called a dealer in that area and was told they would not do the work.  Cris promised that Carl would find a dealer near us who would do the work.  We agree to take the RV if we got assurances that would be done.  We are ready to take the RV and are told we now must do paperwork with Carl, whom we had never met.  Carl  enters the office and immediately tells us the book price on our RV dropped that day so they would no longer give us what Cris had agreed to give us for trade-in.  When I pointed out that we had a written sales agreement, Carl smugly told us that the sales agreement did not have their signature.  He continued with a list of things he found wrong with our RV even though we had gone through everything with Cris on the first day before the sales agreement was written up.  When we explained this to Carl, he would not back down.  His voice became loud and his statements were negative and insulting.  When I told him that I would write a review of the dealership and post it on the internet, he told me their lawyer would deal with me.    At this point, we left. The atmosphere in Carl's office was toxic and hostile.  Certainly not professional nor conducive to selling a product.  They returned our RV to us, which had the state safety inspection scraped off and the floor was extremely dirty with black tar imbedded in the vinyl.   Buyer beware of this dealership."
2.5,4,I bought a toy hauler from this place I love it. It's the second unit I bought from these guys I really like them. Pricing was excellent service was great.
2.5,3,"Anyone reading this review is probably aware of the challenge associated with finding reliable RV service.

The fact that this center is located so close to home, along with the new Meetup group they started recently as part of their public relations program, resulted in my deciding to give them a try when my motorhome required some routine maintenance.

My initial impression was very positive, primarily as result of the interactions I had with the staff, who were all very friendly and helpful.

However, when I returned after 2 weeks to pick up my motorhome, I discovered that this company is pretty much the same as all of the others I've done business with.

Although I had been notified by the service center that my RV was ready to pick up, the brief inspection I did revealed that the technicians had accomplished only about half of what needed to be done. Consequently, I ended up having to leave my motorhome with them for another week so they could finish the job.

Ultimately I decided to raise my rating from two stars to three stars because the service manager did make a genuine effort to get all of the maintenance items completed, the work was done properly, and the office staff seemed to be doing their best to be helpful.

I would not go so far as to warn potential customers to avoid this company, but rather to just be prepared for the usual amount of runaround that seems to be the standard for this industry."
2.5,5,"We chose Scottsdale RV to purchase a 2018 Coachmen Freelander RV because they had the model with the floorplan we wanted in stock, and they gave us the best deal, based on price and trade-in value.  As for service, we've had disappointing experiences with other RV dealers, so we kept our expectations low.  We were pleasantly surprised by the great service provided by the staff who set up the motorhome for us, showed us how to operate all the features of the RV, and made adjustments to correct minor problems.  Rick was particularly helpful in setting up the RV for us, and additional thanks to Allen and the other staff members."
2.5,1,"I went there today to pick up my RV. Observed another customer having the same issues as reported in all the past reviews. This place is moving to Chandler. Good luck. I felt for the customer today. Trying to get his trailer and had made several calls and informed Scottsdale Rv that he would be showing up before noon today. This man, who was very calm, was told he couldn't be helped. He asked for the owner, of which nobody would give him Ryan's number. Customer was over 1 hour away and was totally inconvenienced. Ryan the owner does not call you back or communicate and nobody else can help you. When I tried to get my motorhome, I was told that others were broke down in front of mine and I couldn't get it today. I complained and was told by Noah, (a subcontractor to leave). Finally a Chris, the salesperson intervened and went and was able to get my motorhome freed up so I could take it. Ryan wouldn't return my calls, and the employees were communicating with him via text. If it wasn't for Chris, I would not have been able to pick up my motorhome today. Chris is wasting his talent at this place. On top of all that has happened here to me, I find that a brand new 25 pound filled propane tank and quick connect hose were missing from the storage compartment of my rv. So if you have an rv their for any reason, make sure nothing of value is in it. Could only be internal. Gates are locked and keyed. Bad customer service continues and more customers get the shaft. Scottsdale Rv should close and save all customers the hassle. The worst experience in a business ever. An absolute nightmare. I will be contacting Channel 15, Joe Ducey and the State Attorney generals office to lodge complaints.God help them."
2.5,1,"We bought a used rv there almost 2 months ago.  The salesman didn't know crap about the rv.  The mirrors didn't work and the coach overheated 3 times in 250 miles while going home.  We called and told them and we were advised to take the coach to a repair shop near us.  Their choice.  We took the coach and the guy kept it overnight and told us that because it was taken apart,he didn't know what to do.  We got a bill for his time for almost $300.  We submitted the bill to Scottsdale RV and the CFO said they will not pay it.  We would have never taken it there had Chris not told us to.  No was very very helpful, and tried to help us, but that was out of his hands."
2.5,1,If you are in the market for a new or pre-owned RV I strongly suggest you stay away from Scottsdale RV. They promise you the moon and the stars to get you to buy their products but the second you sign on the dotted line the moon and the stars disappear. And you never get anything done this is the worst buying experience I ever had in my life and this is my third Rv. So please stay away from Scottsdale RV if you want to avoid any Financial headaches.
4,1,"Brought my RV in to have the transmission filters changed and new fluid along with the fuel filter. I had the filter with me so they changed it. They had to go get the transmission filters. They put the new transmission filters in with out adding the transmission fluid. I picked it up drove around 20 miles got out and checked the dip stick there was nothing on it. So I called back and they rushed someone to add 1.5 gallons of fluid. Called in and talked to the manager and the owner."" We made it right we rushed out to add the fluid any damage done is speculation"" The owner said mistakes where made. So he offered a 10% refund and then a 20% refund if we don't give them a bad review. BBB gives them a D- as well watch out if you plan on getting your RV serviced."
4,5,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Lance was very attentive and understanding of my requests, he went above and beyond to provide me with the information I needed.  Lance's professionalism and service is greatly appreciated and I would/will most definitely recommend Arizona RV Supercenter to anyone on the hunt for a RV, seem to be the go to professionals in the industry!"
4,2,We saw that this evening service center had a four star rating. We found it to be very pricey compared to the numerous times we have had it repaired in the past and we were promised it on a Friday morning and did not get it back until mid-afternoon after going there as we could not get info over the phone. We would not recommend it.
4,5,"This place was great!! I actually wasn't stopping there to buy anything, i just happened to stop in for help and there they were. It was the third place that day i stopped looking for help, and they were the ones who took time out of there busy day to make sure i was taken care of. My car died and we couldn't jump it, so i started looking for a jump box which are at most dealerships. Otd good to see people still care."
4,5,"AZ RV Supercenter had a lightly used RV/Toy Hauler that was exactly what I had been looking for for months. Since I was 200 miles away I inquired via email and received a response quickly. They were not pushy and answered all my questions. A friend went to check it out for me and said it was indeed in great condition and ""lightly used"" per the info on line. I did a lot of homework and research to determine what I felt was a fair price on the vehicle. Kyle was great and we quickly negotiated a price over the phone. I drove the 200 miles to pick it up and the technician went over how everything worked in great detail, which I appreciated. The tires had great tread but were several years old. By the time I arrive at my destination, 200 miles later, I went straight to Discount Tires to have them balanced and checked out. Discount discovered that between the age of the tires, the heat (110 degrees when I left Mesa) and the trip itself, the tires were starting to separate. I ended up purchasing 5 new tires. 

Here's the amazing and impressive part - I emailed Kyle about the tires and stated, even though I did sign a buy ""As Is"" agreement, I felt I should be reimbursed for the tire purchase. Kyle discussed the situation with management and they sent me a check for the tires THAT SAME DAY. I was ready to do battle but Arizona RV Supercenter did the right thing immediately. What a pleasant change from the way many business operate these days. 

I am not easily impressed but I will recommend Arizona RV Supercenter to everyone I know for sales, rental, service and parts/accessories. Kyle was great to work with in the sales dept. He stayed in touch with me, answered all my emails and phone calls in a very timely manner, and went to bat for me with the tire issue. Very Impressive business!"
4,5,"I know why this place has 5 stars. I'd give it more if I could. We were helped by a very smart service man. I wish we'd gotten his name. We just needed assistance with our microwave, tv, and hitch. He spent about 30 minutes helping us work out some kinks and  adding two lock washers on the trailer hitch. There was no charge!  What?  Great service and a very nice employee. We left very satisfied and recommend this bisiness highly. If this is how they treat people they are above the rest in my book

I wanted to add that we from out of state."
4,5,"Great customer service ! They are creative.
Thanks Anne Marie and Wade"
4,5,"We took our 1999 Chevy Silverado in to Arizona RV Supercenter because our camper shell was leaking between the shell and the cab of the truck. On a summer trip to the east much of the contents got wet due to this leak. I wouldn't have even know this business existed except I discovered them while walking down Main St in Mesa one day. I walked in and asked if they would do a little job like mine since it appeared they just worked on and rented the large RV's. We were very frustrated with this problem because we had already had it in for repair at Little Dealer Little Prices in Mesa. They charged us much more, and it didn't even fix the problem so decided not to take it back there. Arizona RV Supercenter completely fixed the problem, and all for only $100. I can't say enough good things about this business."
4,5,"Service department great. Took our RV in for check on the refrigerator, They had it checked out and ready to go in just 2 days. Also had it washed and it looked great. Very professional and friendly. Will be using them for all our RV service needs."
4,5,"This is an RV rental & sales company that has an actual repair facility on site for any type of RV service. Our RV's wheel bearing seized & lost its tire on the interstate, 60 miles north of Phoenix. We needed new axels, wheel bearings, brakes, tire, hub & bodywork. This is the only RV center that could & did take our RV & was willing to help us. They had a technician wait for us & make sure that we were ok & settled. No one else did that. 14 phone calls from the side of the interstate & that many ""sorry we can't help you!"" Anna Marie was calming & very helpful during our time of need. The whole crew has taken excellent care of us during a very dark hour. We are from out of state & live in our RV. They were all genuinely kind & caring. Thank you!"
4,5,"We recently purchased a new toy hauler and wanted a bed lift system installed, something that is typically done at the factory but in our case it wasn't included. 

We first tried working with Camping World...what a mistake. After meeting with the service reps at Camping World and being promised that they were working on getting the required info from suppliers, etc to be able to order parts, there was not any follow through. After 2 months of waiting and 4 trips to meet with them in person we finally gave up on them. There was no follow through from Camping World, and they had nothing but excuses. We will never go there again for any kind of service.

After searching the Internet for other places to go, we ended up choosing Arizona RV Supercenter. Being a little apprehensive based on the negative Camping World experience, we were very happy with AZ RV Supercenter from the first time we walked in the door. The place has a small town, family ran business aura about it, and the employees will actually talk to you with a smile and give you a sense that they truly want to take care of whatever RV issues you might have. 

From the first day, we interfaced with Anna Marie, and we can't say enough great things about her. She would continuously call us with the status of our modifications, and we always knew how to get in touch with her if we had a question or wanted to retrieve the trailer for a quick trip while we were waiting on parts to be delivered.

In addition to installing a bed lift system in the back ( which they had to interface with suppliers that were generally unhelpful), they also designed and installed a custom screened in room that we can use to enclose the back of the toy hauler when the back ramp door is opened and held up by cables to make it a deck. 

All in all, the service at Arizona RV Supercenter was excellent, the prices were reasonable, and we would highly recommend them to anyone that needs any kind of RV service or modifications made to their trailer....and by the way, they rent and sale trailers and RVs as well."
4,5,"It has been a couple of months since our oil change and generator in our coach. We wanted to thank Ann Marie for getting us in right away.  We are fulltime RV'ers and we do appreciate good work and customer service.

I ran my own business for years, and customer service is #1,  Ann Marie is it!!!!  The crew is also very helpful and meticulous.

Thank you so much once more.

4,1,"I traveled all the way to this so-called ""supercenter"" based on the positive so-called reviews and the seller's so-called statement on their website that they have a ""large current inventory"" of Class A & Class C motorhomes. Please look at the photo I took of their sales lot when I arrived today. THIS is their ""large current inventory"".

Mesa and the surrounding communities probably have more RV dealers than most places in America and even the tiniest dirt lot dealer has at least several dozen units on display. But not at AZ RV Supercenter, come on, ONE RV? What a waste of my time coming here, how is it even possible that there are people reviewing this place?"
4,5,"As we are pretty new to RVing I was worried if we could get appointment fairly quickly and how much the work would cost. I've read horror stories on line. Anne Marie was very helpful and got us right in, the work was done pretty quickly and we thought reasonably priced. The customer service was excellent - nice people to deal with!"
4,5,"We had a problem with our camper leaking, and I thought we were in for a big repair bill, since it appears that the previous owner 'bumped' the top front end at some point. We were passing through Phoenix in a rainstorm, and stopped at the Arizona RV Supercenter. Chris F. examined the camper, and fixed the leak within 10 or 15 minutes. There was no charge. What a pleasant and welcome surprise! 

Chris F and the other staff got us in quickly, were pleasant and courteous, and took care of the problem, and sent us on our way. I couldn't be happier!"
4,5,"Wade was a very knowledgeable salesman. Wade educated us on RVs during the process. I think this place would provide good maintenance on an RV and sell you something without lots of broken items.  My husband and I bought elsewhere because we found a used unit that fit our needs better. Wade was a great start, and what we learned after going to many locations, is this location also specializes in servicing RVs. We will happily take our RV for service here. (Not where we purchased from)"
4,1,I attempted to reach their service department 3 times in 2 days and never received a returned call.  I tried to reach them twice by phone and left a message after the phone rang many times and rolled over to the main number.  They took a message but the service department never returned my calls. I then tried the service request form on their website and still have not received a return call.  So I'll just take my money elsewhere to get my repairs.
4,4,Anna Marie was very nice.  She went above and beyond in trying to find a part that would work for me.
4.5,5,Frank and Anna are super fair and super great work for me. I am a repeat customer and recommend them to anyone looking for superior work at a great price!!
4.5,5,"A great place at reasonable prices. Had 2 different projects completed here... Took my restored 1962 Shasta camper seats here, had them make new ones for me. I bought the foam, they did the upholstery. Way better than I expected, super professional job, and I was more than happy! Then, I took my tall patio chairs in to be recovered, and they did another perfect job. They look fantastic. Friendly staff, super thorough. highly recommended!"
4.5,5,"Nearly two years later and the other seat split. Jesse not only made my seat look new again, he rushed the job and finished in two hours so I could make it back uptown in time for a lunch meeting. They were busy, too, so I know this was extra effort on their part. Palacios is personal, efficient, reasonable and friendly. No need to look elsewhere."
4.5,5,"Searched numerous upholstery places and was reluctant because someone reviewing on Google said they were unhappy with the quality of work recently.  However, out of numerous upholstery places (some of which never returned my calls or emails) Palacios had the shortest turn around time and the same price quote ballpark.  Additionally, they were the most prompt responding to my emails.  I decided to have them reupholster an accent chair with a complicated pattern and we couldn't be happier with the quality of work.  They also were able to rush the reupholstery process, so the chair was available for a party.  I would recommend them and I will definitely return."
4.5,5,"very great customer service, the lady who answered the phone I didn't get her name was very helpful will deff be taking my furniture here.!"
4.5,5,This was my second visit to Palacios for auto upholstry repair.  The quality of their work is excellent and their customer service exceeded my expectation!  I just called to schedule a repair on my other vehicle.
4.5,5,Jessie is a master in his profession!  I took him an old RV and it came out looking amazing.  All new upholstery and a new entertainment center.  The value I got for my money was beyond what I could have expected.  Thanks Jesse!
4.5,5,"Great place! They have redone several of my boats.  Awesome work, super price.  Highly recommend."
4.5,5,I had a chair redone here. They were so nice and knowledgeable. I loved the choices they had and they helped me to pick out something awesome for the chair. I will be having more done soon.
4.5,5,I had hardwood floors installed in my RV. They also reupholstered my couch and bench seats in leather. The price was right and the work was fantastic! I went back a year later for a them to install a flat screen and refinish some cabinets. Could not have been happier with the results. Great family business.
4.5,5,"Family owned-business. Easy to find, great work and excellent customer service!!

I was looking for a place that could help me put in a grommet on a college mascot flag. I first went to Paul's Ace Hardware because they are great - always so helpful. Unfortunately, they would have to sell me the grommet AND the tool to put it in. I really didn't want to buy the tool since it would be for only one use. 
So I headed out for an upholstery shop and found Palacio's. Not only did he install the grommet while I waited but refused to charge me anything. They recognize the value of word-of-mouth advertising and, in my experience, those are the businesses that provide the best work and customer service."
4.5,5,I have had work done by Palacios Upholstery twice - great work each time.  Highly recommended
4.5,5,"This company is fantastic. I had a small tear in an outdoor cushion. I took it in, expecting to have to leave it. They repaired it on the spot in less than five minutes and the price was unbelievable! I recommend this company highly."
4.5,5,"My name is Patricia Bustamante and I rating Palacios 5 Stars with no reservations. The quality of work is superior. The staff is friendly, helpful, and professional. I brought my car to have my car aeat, and one rest arm reupholstered. The work looks brand new. I highly recommend Palacios for those customers looking for high quality work."
4.5,5,"I was referred to Palacio's by a friend who had them put a wood floor in his R.V.  I have a 4x4 van and wanted the seats rearranged for my kids and for camping.  Jesse was friendly, and worked with me to get the price into a range my wife could tolerate.  Haha!  We only did half the work so far, but I am more than pleased.  Even my wife said to me, ""Wow honey.  It looks really nice.""  I would definitely recommend Palacio's."
4.5,1,"I took my car there to get a small hole repaired. I asked them three times not to make it worse. When I saw the repair it was terrible. Then they ripped me off for 70.00, don't go here as the owner didn't care that I was unhappy. This place sucks I would never recommend it. All there good reviews are only from family members."
4.5,5,"My husband and I took our travel trailer to Jesse at Palacios Upholstery a couple of weeks ago. I read many great reviews on Yelp and called to schedule an appointment.  I didn't like the fabric on our jackknife & dinette cushions and wanted to change it.  I couldn't go with my husband to pick up the trailer, and when I got home from work, I was very pleased except for two things.  I called and spoke to Jesse and he said to bring it back in and they'd take care of it.  Probably for most people, they wouldn't have noticed anything, but unfortunately I am pathetically picky.  We were so pleased with their ethics and professionalism that we decided to have the tear in the driver seat of our Jeep Grand Cherokee fixed as well.  So yesterday we took the Jeep and the trailer back down and both were fixed the same day and we were extremely pleased with the work.  Jesse put a rush on this as he knew we were moving out of state in two weeks and we had a lot going on.  He also thanked me for pointing out the two issues I had and apologized for not catching it himself, but like I said, most people wouldn't have even noticed.  What a great business owner...professional and ethical.

I would highly recommend Palacios Upholstery."
4,5,"My 8 year old vehicle looked many times better after this company finished detailing it today (approx 3.5 hours). I thought my gray leather seats would never look good given the wear and tear over the years, but they now look very close to when I got the car! This company was professional, they took their time, communicated throughout the process and were very knowledgable. I definitely did not feel that I was just a number on their list, they truly wanted to make sure they did a great job and that I was happy with their service. I appreciated the friendly service-oriented nature and I definitely will use this company again! I will also recommend to friends."
4,5,"Car looks good, wash, shampoo, wax, condition, and cleaned.  $150 well spent.  Came back a few days later to clean under the hood.  This was the second time we used this business for a detail and will use again in the future."
4,1,"I scheduled, then re-scheduled to have my vehicle detailed by this Company, but unfortunately, he never showed. The first time (last week) he apologised and re-scheduled. Today, he called to say he was on his way, then never arrived. I made several attempts to make contact, left voicemail.... Silence. It's not as if I had some coupon he didn't want to honour!?! 

I could understand another, high-priority job coming up, but communication is key...

Ultimately, I would not know if he does a excellent, good or poor job, since he simply never shows up. Not the way to run a company."
4,5,"I bought my car in 2008 and it has not been professionally detailed since. Needless to say, it was a hot mess. These guys did such an amazing job! They made my car look completely new again inside and out. Service was incredible and they couldn't have been any nicer or more accommodating. I'll be back!"
3,5,"They come to you, kind and courteous. Very knowledgeable. Fixed my car I had sitting for 4 years in the garage. My car now runs with the best of them and its 20 years old. Never ever will go to another place again. Oh and Scott is the BEST EVER!!!"
3,1,"WOMEN BEWARE!!! Can I leave 0 stars? I have never dealt with such a sketchy company. I called about a dead battery that needed a jump. And was quoted between 165 and 190 to have someone come fix it which was fine, I was at home with my baby and had no choice. After the mechanic was done he gave me a bill for $290 and billed for a new battery and an hour of labor on my car even though he was literally there for seven minutes. I know because I was standing holding my child at dinner time looking at the clock because I had to get her to bed. He kept trying to get me to go get him cash even though I explained I couldn't leave the house with my little one. He made me feel extremely uncomfortable and he said he no way to take a credit card. I tried for a half an hour to call the main line listed and no one was answering even though it states they are open until 9pm. After I told him I had left a message at the main number, then he somehow was magically able to pull up the invoice sheet that had a place for me to put my credit card information. I filled out my information and told him even though it was twice what I was quoted I was going to keep trying to call the main office because I wasn't given the AAA discount I was promised nor was this the agreed-upon price. But because neither one of us can get a hold of the main office I told him I would take it up with them. I went back into my house. Five minutes later he called me and asked me for the phone number to my bank because he said he couldn't get my credit card to go through and he wanted my bank account information. I told him I was not going to give him my banking information number over the phone and to have someone at the main line listed on the website call me. He then gave me a different number to call, not the business line listed on their website but someone he said would ""help"" me. I spoke with that person on the phone who said that my quoted price was wrong and that the person who took my call should have explained how the billing works. I told him that his poor business practices were not my problem, and that they could go ahead and run my card but that I would be disputing the charges with someone at the main office and my bank because the whole thing seemed like a phishing scam. I then told him I was going to have the mechanic escorted off property by security because the whole situation was making me feel very uncomfortable. If you are a single woman, or somebody who has small children I would stay away from this company, these men seem predatory. What kind of company asks for your banking information over the phone? And tries to take pictures of your credit cards? Not a legitimate one if you ask me."
3,1,"We were travelling through Las Vegas in our RV and the dash AC stopped working and one of our rooftop AC units went out. Kameron , the mechanic came out and charged our AC in the front dash, we were quoted $265 from his boss on the phone but Kameron tried to up charge us an additional $200.  I should have known not to let him come back and work on our roof top AC unit!  He quoted us $1850 for labor and installation for the roof top AC unit.  It took 2 days of talking to him on the phone and waiting for the unit to arrive in Las Vegas. He showed up late in the afternoon, spent 1.5 hours installing it and then charged us $2345, $495 more than was quoted.  I should not have paid the additional $495 but we were just too tired and wanted to get on the road.  I am sure some of the other mechanics that work for this company are honest but if Kameron shows up, turn him away!!!"
3,5,"From my dad Danny,
Larry was awesome!! Great service, timely, friendly and exceeded my expectations."
3,1,"The price they charge for parts Are more than any where in the town..
For 125$ starter they charged me 389$...
Never call them... 
When I called them to ask why the price is high? He was mad on me... And he told its ridiculous to pay and ask for money back...
I didn't like it at allllllll"
3,5,Last night this place saved me! I went to my mom's and noticed that my car leaked a bunch of coolant. I didn't want to drive my car and damage the engine so I called accurate mobile mechanic and they said they couldn't come till 7. I called at 8pm and left several voicemails and none were returned. So I called here and they told me they couldn't get anyone out until the morning. I think they heard the desperation in my voice and they called back and a friendly mechanic came out in 10 minutes. I think his name was Cory but I'm pretty bad with names. He was able to fix my leak and make sure nothing else was leaking! I would totally recommend them to everyone!
3,5,"Blake did an amazing job for my wife and I tonight when we had a roadside problem here in Las Vegas.  Blake was fast, thorough and great to deal with.  I cannot recommend Mobile Mechanics of Las Vegas strongly enough.  I'll use them again anytime the need arises and I'll specifically request Blake.  

Peter"
3,4,"These folks seem pretty available. When I called, they told me they could have someone to me in an hour. It took quite a bit longer, but these folks can save you the expense of a tow! If you're ever somewhere and need your car jumped or a small fix, I'd call them first!"
3,5,"Mobile Mechanics arrived on time, did quality work, showed interest in fixing the problem properly. Keith the mechanic was professional and quite knowledgable. I highly recommend Keith and Mobile Mechanics. 
I'm usually suspicious of mechanics, but it was obvious Keith assessed the problem, then executed a plan. I'm a satisfied customer."
3,1,"If I could give them a -5 I would!  This place cost us $6,000 after they worked on our RV.  A job that we were quoted as taking 4 hours took 4 days and after day 4 they ruined our RV!  We asked them to replace the bearings in our front wheel they discovered that they brake line had rubbed and needed to be replaced.  So we had the replaced it.  After their work our brakes did not operate correctly, mind you no brake issue prior to their service.  We found out that the ABS is now shot.  Due to the manufacture of the RV this would happen if the brakes were bleed incorrectly.  Well this company has refused to take any responsibility to the damage that THEY caused.  So we now need to fix what the broke plus we are out the money for their time that we paid them to break what wasn't broken!!!  We may need to seek legal action against this company."
3,4,"These guys are great .  Our Classic Chevy Van would not start . We called mobile Mechanics of Las Vegas and within 1 1/2 hours Kevin showed up at our house. He found the problem and reset our ignition switch and the Van ran fine. They did not try to sell us a starter or a new switch he just fixed our problem. We will eventually have to replace the switch and when we do we will call. Mobile Mechanics of Las Vegas.  Thanks Kevin

Scott Harris"
3,5,"Great experience! New to Las Vegas so had not found a local repair shop yet. Found them online and called to get more info and was treated so well, answered all my questions and had someone dispatched to my house within 45 minutes. Scott showed up and found out my battery needed replaced. We are keeping this number! And I will recommend Mobile Mechanics to anyone that needs help. Thanks!"
3,5,"I highly recommend Mobile Mechanic! We were about to head out of our house yesterday and our car battery died. We were trying to move the car out of our garage in order to jumpstart it with our other car when a Mobile Mechanic van happened to drive by. Kevin, the driver, saw us and immediately stopped and said: ""Which car needs to be jumped?"". He helped us get the car started in 5 minutes flat, gave us his card and was on his way. What luck! And Kevin was super nice."
3,5,"I know there are negative reviews here...but getting your vehicle repaired on a holiday, while your stuck far away from home, and having a guy willing to do it in 110 degree heat, has to mean something.

We had an RV with a loose exhaust manifold that created a burned spark plug keeping us from traveling faster than 20 mph on grades.....Patrick came out on Labor Day and tightened the loose manifold and replaced the bad wire...even left me with a spare spark plug wire if it happens again.  He had to crawl under the motorhome in 110 degree heat...and dismantle parts of console on top of the dog house to get to the parts....and we're on our way home.  

Was it expensive - much more than it would have cost at home with our mechanic?  Yes..very....was it cheap in light of where we were and the fact that it was Labor Day?  Very...thank you Patrick!"
3,4,"My used RV needed new air bags for the suspension.  Setup the appointment and was quoted a price.  Ryan and Darrel came out promptly at the time of the appointment and began removing the old air bags.  After removing them, Ryan explained that he was going to head back to the shop to get the parts.  Unfortunately, they did not have my air bags in stock, and the only place in town that carried them wanted about what the original quote was, without the labor.  I would have given 5 stars, but we had some miscommunication.  So, Ryan and Darrel had to come back out, and put the old air bags back in, just so I could at least move it.  This was at 9pm.  Didn't think they would be able to come back that late, but they did.  Also, Ryan did an inspection on my radiator and showed me what needed to be done.  And he took a look at my brakes just to make sure they were alright.  This is our first RV, and I have lots of questions.  And Ryan was more than helpful and informative on things to look for with the RV, and what type of PM I should be doing for it.  I ended up having to order the air bags from out of state, and when they come in, I am definitely calling Mobile Mechanics, and Ryan and Darrel back to replace them.  Couldn't be more pleased."
3,1,"If I could rate them -1 I would. Do not call these people to fix your vehicle! It's more convenient to take your car in some where. At least you will know professionals are taking care of your vehicle. These people are over priced, unprofessional, and have no idea what they are doing. Please save yourself the hassle to go elsewhere for your car repair !"
3,1,"I would give them negative stars if I could. This place refused to honor their guarantee. Claimed I never called them, that they didn't do th work. Finally he realized he did and tried to get me to take it up with his employee. WhenI told him it was his responsibility, he told me to change my attitude or I would get nothing. Cslled me a f##king b###h and hung up on me. I file a complaint with the BBB. He already had 8 complaints, 4 in the last year. Avoid at all costs."
3,5,My sons car died in a 7eleven parking lot and mobile mechanics of Las Vegas just happened to be parked in the lot. We asked him to look at the car and he diagnosed it as a bad alternator. We went to O'Reilly auto parts and got one. We called in and ordered service. They were very prompt and called us right back. The technician was there in less than an hour. He discovered a broken bolt and I quickly went to the hardware store and got one while he patiently waited. Brought it back and he replaced the alternator in just a few minutes. He then jump started the car and checked the battery. Price was more than reasonable and we were very happy to get back on the road. Did I mention it was over 100 degrees outside? Thanks to Derrick! We are very pleased with the service we received. I definitely recommend this company.
3,5,"Unlike some other reviewers, I had a good experience with mobile mechanics!

My bf and I were driving through Las Vegas in our RV on our way to Arizona during Memorial weekend. Unfortunately for us, after stopping for a breakfast buffet, our rv motor started idling strangely and would then die. We found ourselves stuck in a random shopping plaza with the outside temps rising. Of course, I started panicking thinking our weekend plans were ruined and we would be stuck in LV since so many other repair places were closed.

But Scott with mobile mechanics came to the rescue and with some macgyvering of our carburetor, we were on our way in a couple of hours! Scott was great, had a lot of good advice and info for us and put us at ease that our plans weren't ruined. Thanks Scott!"
3,5,"My car wouldn't start and I wasn't sure what to do. So I looked up Mobile Mechanics since I needed someone to come and check it out for me. I was so impressed with the service I received. 

Ryan the Mechanic showed up and found the problem right away. I was so relieved to find out it was not a major issue. He was able to get the part I needed quickly and my car was back up and running. 

Great customer service all around from the initial call back to when Ryan showed up. I will use their services again. Keep up the great work."
3,1,"WORST MECHANIS EVER DONT USE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! them  ever they dont know what they are doing we had a broken injector and the mechanic didnt even lube it so while replaceing it broke it he also pulled our airfilter out to use as a arm rest and then broke our radiator while leaning on it told us he has no money to replace it so we gave him $267 to get a new one when returned with the new one we called him out on not properly installing the injector and he argued with us and then left with our radiator and never retured and stop answering our calls the owner said well this went to shit and said he would get him to come back we told him we did not want his mechanic touching any more of our truck we just wanted our money back or the radiator .then he stopped answering our calls we had to buy another radiator and injector and some local guys helped us get it fixed . monday we called the owner back and he said we didnt give them a chance to fix it so they will not refund us the money on the raditaor 
sloppy and a scamming company DONT USE THESE GUYS THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF we were from out of town and these guys showed no compassion and was just worried about getting paid for breaking more than what was wrong to start with 
BAD BAD BAD THEY DESERVE NO STARS"
3,1,"If it was possible for me to give no stars I would. I called to have on site battery replacement. After waiting for over an hour thinking someone was on the way. I called back to find out no on was on the way and that I would have to wait another 45 mins. When I asked for a discount on the service for having to wait the ""manager"" told me ""no I can't discount the service"" when I asked why he followed with ""uhhhh because I don't want to."" 

You'd be wasting your time and money on these people. They don't have the customer service skills to keep people coming back."
3,1,"NOT 24/7.
We needed a belt change and fuel filter. Told them we were in a hurry.  They were deceitful about timing Spain 1-1.5 max. After waiting an hour on them I called and told them we would walk across street and grab food.  They showed up about 30 minutes later and got part numbers, took money in advance (big no-no), then said he would be right back.  An hour later we saw him still in or park collecting money from another guy.  We since discovered this is their business model. After 4 hours I paid him to leave and we fixed ourselves! Very frustrating experience.  Mechanic blamed greed boss! They know RVers are usually desperate and take advantage!
0 STARS!"
3,4,I just worked with Larry. He helped get my brakes fixed on my 2014 Honda Crosstour. He was super friendly and showed me exactly what was faulty on my brake system and showed me the step by step process of what needed fixing. I would use this service again.
3,1,"I called Mobile Mechanics for a second opinion after the first diagnosis of a blown headgasket and recommendation for a replacement engine (my car had less than 90K miles at this point) at a cost or $4K. The mechanic confirmed the diagnosis and noted a single error code on my receipt indicating a faulty temperature sensor. I spoke to the owner, who stated that the gasket could be replaced and the engine rebuilt at a cost of ~$2K. 

This began a long ordeal with Mobile Mechanic and the shitty shop he contracts out to in N Las Vegas, Garcia Auto Repair (http://www.yelp.com/biz/garcia-auto-repair-las-vegas). I had 2 subsequent breakdowns leaving me stranded in the middle of Vegas each time after less than 25 miles of driving. 

The bottom line is that they failed to replace the faulty sensor, which resulted in the head gasket blowing a second time. Because the engine block could only take one round of resurfacing my engine was irreparably damaged due to their negligence. Mobile Mechanic forced me to pay for parts for the second head gasket even though they gave me a 1 yr, 10K mileage warranty. The head of the shop told me, ""You can just keep bringing it in when it breaks down."" The Mobile Mechanics owner refused to take my calls at this point, so I was screwed. I was afraid to drive my car lest I be stranded in miles from home, so I ended up having to spend the $4K to get the engine replacement at the first shop."
3,1,"This was such a bummer of an experience. We drove from California out to Vegas to go buy a car and we wanted it inspected. We called and set it up earlier that day with whoever answered the phone. My red flag should have been when he said call 30 min ahead and remind me. Anyways, I did call. He never showed where he was supposed to meet us for an inspection at the car dealership. I called 5 times and texted. Not only did we not purchase the vehicle, we felt like we were inconveniencing the guy at the car dealership because he were all waiting. 

I own a small business myself, and having some customer service experience i can't understand for the life of me why he couldn't just call and say he wasn't gonna make it. I would not recommend someone this flaky to be trusted with fixing your vehicle. Plus, I'm sure there's much better businesses out there to work with."
3,2,"I called and was told they would be there in an hour. I waited 2 hours, called again, no answer. Another hour, called again, no answer. Another hour someone shows up. He couldn't install the serpentine belt, said I had purchased the wrong one. I told him what to do and had to help him. So we got the belt on. 
He was 4 hours late, spent about 5 to 10 minutes, I had to tell him how to do it, I had to help, I paid him $85 (up front by the way), and he left without even offering to put my tire back on or anything.
Not a good experience."
3,1,The owner is a bullshitter and a liar. He way over charges and doesn't get the job done. Stay away!!!!! Wicked douchebag!!!!
3,4,We had Steve and his mechanic fix our bob cat  ( large equipment) about a week ago. We were satisfied with the service. We had called others who were a no show.  It took only a few days to get some parts and all parties were happy. GOOD JOB!
3,1,Was upset because the guy claimed to know what was wrong my car for why it wasn't starting and what he claimed wasn't even the problem ! I payed for the labor fee twice and for parts that I didn't need to be fixed ! Overall I spent close to 500 bucks to end up seeing my car not be fixed ! I had my car towed to a shop for 60 bucks and they found what was really wrong with my car in less then a hour and they offered me a payment plan ! My car was fixed in less than a week and it's running just fine ! I don't really recommend these mobile machanic people . Horrible !
3,1,The guy they sent to my house was very nice (Kevin) He replaced my sons power steering pump on his car on 9/17 a couple days later on 9/19/15 I called Mobile Mechanics because the car was making this grinding noise again to see what they suggested I do. Still no call back as of today. So my son took his car to pep boys because of the same noise as before and they said it was only because he didn't let it idle. My complaint is customer service stinks if a customer calls a 24 hour establishment they should get a call back what if he were stranded somewhere.
3,5,Brandon fixed a service truck for my husband that was stranded at an autozone and did an amazing job. He was very polite and quick. Didn't overcharge or make us pay for anything unnecessary. Very professional company. We were on a very strict time constraint and they weren't bothered by the multiple times we had to call and check in with them to see about an ETA. Easy to deal with and he did an awesome job!
3,1,"I used these people on sept 13/2016 they did a front brake job on MY suv the price was 
right the service was fine but I paid with My bank debit card the mechanic that did the 
work got all My information today sept 20/2016 someone is using My debit card fraudulently
the only person who had that information was the mechanic that came to My house if anyone
uses this company make sure You pay them only with cash otherwise You will get scammed
I know I did  be ware of this company"
3,1,This company is horrible do not use them. They completly took my car apart and left everything in the engine while I was inside looking for a part at autozone. They have horrible service and arrived an hour late. Preston and wayne were the mechanics PLEASE DO NOTBUSE THIS COMPANY. They evenbgave their numbers to do side jobs and they are not supposed to. Their boss Steve will no longer answer the phone and I will be taking them to court. Prestons number is 2186844392 and wayne is 7027048305
3,1,"i called mobile mechanic to fixed my car, when he arrived collect $85 for fee upront this guy name kevin put the diagnostic code reader to find out whats wrong with the car when he found out he told me that he cant fix the car and he cant do anything about it...dont call this mechanic again they dont know what are they doin, bad costumer service especially the manager when i called let them know about my disappointment and he told me that he cant help me anymore and hang up."
3,4,"Our car battery died, and after a jump from AAA, it wouldn't hold a charge.  AAA didn't have the starter battery available.  Steve had us meet the mechanic at the auto parts store so the mechanic would be able to install it right away.  Turns out the auto parts clerk had the wrong part.  The mechanic was awesome.  He spent the next two hours running my boyfriend to another parts store, trying to rig an alternate solution, and attempt to jump the car again and again.  At the end, it turns out it is a specialty part and we were stuck in Vegas until the dealership opened 2 days later.

Steve and his team were incredibly patient and the mechanic was incredibly patient and went over and beyond what was required of him.  He felt so bad for us and was incredibly human.  Will recommend them to anyone!"
3,1,"I cant see this company staying in business for long. My car was leaking oil so I began my mechanic search. This place was the first business to pop up on google so I decided to give them a try. Wow was that a HUGE mistake. They said they would pick up the car in an hour. 4 hours later I called to confirm my address and they were extremely rude but said the tow truck was in route. Going against my judgment I allowed them to take the car ( 5 hours later). The estimate called for a week and a half and I was quoted $1,500 for repairs which was a great price until they called a week and a half later and said it was going to be $3,700 and they needed full payment to finish the car (never heard of that before) so I said I would pay for parts only. They agreed and we set up a meet time at an address they claimed was their office. When I arrived at the address I was given it was at a UPS store. Turns out that is their PO box and not a real office. I waited outside and after many phone calls and waiting for 2 hours to confirm I was in the right place the owner Steve said he was at another job and couldn't make it. We agreed to meet at the same place the next day with the same outcome so I began to get very worried I might have been the victim of a scam. I started to search his business license number and nothing came up anywhere nor any actual address of an office or shop. After leaving many messages with the company the owner finally got back to me and said they wanted the total balance again in order to finish the car. I explained to him that this is not how you do business and it is time for me to take legal action against him and his ""business"". He called me every cuss word imaginable and said I would never see the car again then hung up. I called the police and they explained how they would come with me to get the car back but only one problem, nobody knows or can find an address on the internet for Mobile mechanics of las vegas. After a week goes by the owner calls me and we have a good talk about the actions im prepared to take in order to get my car back. He agrees to just fix the car as planned and I could pay the full amount when the car is finished. He says the car will be done in a few days his ""shop"" is almost done. He called me on the third day and said he needed another 3 days (really?). He called me the third day and said he will meet me at his"" breakfast spot"" and I could follow him to get my car. I showed up at the ""breakfast spot"" and he was there with his whole family at the table and he introduces me to everyone then says "" so, I need some money?"" I told him absolutely, after a test drive with you driving and me in passenger and I will hand the cash right over. He says "" if you don't put the money in my hand right now you will never see your car again."" I laughed a bit and asked if he was serious that I cant even see the car until he is payed? He started with his cussing routine and said thank you for the car. I stood up and said good luck to you, Sir. I walked out of the restaurant and headed back to work. He called again about an hour later and I answered telling him our conversation is being recorded. he then begins lying about everything and how his guys need to get paid and hes losing money blah blah blah. I told him it was very simple, if you allow me to go along for a test drive to prove the car is in working order I will pay. He agrees and says he will do that and to meet him at his office right away (UPS store). After waiting for 2 hours he shows up and says he needed the cash before he can take me to his shop. I started walking away and he said I will give you a 90 day warranty before you pay. I agreed and said fine take me to see the car and you will have cash in your hand. I follow him to the run down house in the middle of nowhere off Pecos st. and he walks to the gate and says your not stepping foot on my property until you pay. What!!? so after arguing he agrees to let me see my car and he hand writes on a piece of paper a 90 day parts warranty. I hand him the cash then he tells me that when they installed the oil cooler parts they take a lot of oil so I will need to add a quart and that some radiator fluid was spilled so I would need to top that off as well. I looked at him and smiled and said thank you. As im driving all the lights on the dash pop on again and the car begins to over heat and smell of burnt oil and radiator fluid. I pulled over and noticed a series of deep scratches on one of the quater panels. The car is now at the Mercedes dealer being inspected and I am taking proper legal steps to make sure this never happens to anyone else. If you need car repair please for the love of god never ever call Mobile Mechanics of Las Vegas."
3,4,Thank you Scott and Deigo for your hard work and time on replacing my alternator while we are visiting family in Vegas. It was wonderful that you could come to us at a hotel and saved us from having to tow our vehicle to a shop on a holiday weekend.
3,1,"Extreme disappointment in the manner in which my transmission leak was(not) handled.& months have passed and the mechanic Kevin has been out here 3 times and the hoses he allegedly repaired are still leaking. I spoke with the owner Steve 4 times and he apologized and called the mechanic (Kevin) numerous times who is not responding to my calls or even the owners call. He did agree to reverse the entire credit card charge of 273.00 while I was logged into Capital One.  I have been unable to drive my car for 7 days due to the negligent work Kevin performed and am afraid to drive the car still as the leak is even worse and my transmission could be ruined by driving it.(my garage floor is covered in transmission fluid as well) . To be fair he agreed to waive all charges(273.00) which is the fair thing to do and I  logged into my Capital One account while I had him on the phone and disputed the charge for services not rendered and selecting the option that owner is not disputing the charges and advised him that I had completed the dispute and stopped the charges per his agreement/word. That is fair and appreciated, yet then told me I would have to now work out a price with the new mechanic he was sending out between 3 and 5 today??? This is a strange dichotomy as he agreed to waive all charges, yet now expects me to work out a price with another mechanic he would send out. I feel like the entire cost should be absorbed by the owner as I have been without transportation ALL WEEK and the leak is worse now than it was before the work began on my car. He told me that he could not do that as they had to be paid as they are independent contractors even though he is the company owner. That may be the case, but to be fair it is not my responsibility. I have been more than patient as the mechanic apologized on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and told me to call him if there were any other problems. The bottom line is my car is still not repaired (the leak is actually worse) and now I am being asked to work out a price with another of his employees? I am now going to have to make arrangements to get a ride to my dr appt this afternoon as well as find someone to repair a leak that is still not repaired after waiting  a week WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION. I am extremely disappointed as I will have to find another mobile mechanic company as I am disabled and driving is a considerable challenge.(Going to dr appts and the grocery store are the only times I drive as I live alone and have no choice. I chose this company due to all the positive reviews, yet my experience was the complete opposite of the positive reviews. Again, I appreciate Steve(owner) agreeing to reverse all charges, but I am still unable to drive my vehicle. I wish things had worked out differently as Kevin presented himself as a very competent and professional mechanic; sadly this was not the case. I am having my vehicle towed into a brick and mortar shop tomorrow (85.00 tow bill using AAA) as I am afraid of further damaging my vehicle and will update this review once my car is repaired. I was impressed by the majority of positive ratings and am disappointed that my experience could not have been a 5 star and completed in one day as agreed.

 UPDATE. 6/7/ and 08/01 After having my car repaired by a brick and mortar shop,  for 398.00, I have been hospitalized since March 7th .Upon returning home, I was advised by my family in Dallas that my Dad had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was going into hospice. I returned last week and while going through my mail, Capital One advised me that the owner was now disputing the charge of 273.00 which he had agreed to reimburse me since the work was never completed (the leak was actually worse) and as stated above, I had to have the service performed at a brick and mortar facility. I am extremely disappointed that the owner agreed to do the fair thing and reimburse the charge of 273.00 since the work was never completed and his technician never returned my calls or the owners. I am contesting the charge once again as the owner decided to recharge me 3 separate times despite Capital One reimbursing the charge on March 1 after apologizing and assuring me he would refund the full amount I was charged on February 7th. This is a sad commentary on their business model as my statement showed that my refund was processed per our conversation on Feb 7th.
UPDATE 1/4/18 Despite numerous calls to owner and submitting documentation showing the work described above was never performed, I have still not had the owner honor his word regarding refunding the disputed amount of 273.00 Also, it should be noted that I paid up front in good faith as I was told that the parts would have to be purchased.  The owner is a spineless liar who assured me he would refund my cc charge, I have reported them to the BBB as well. STAY CLEAR OF THIS CLIP JOINT and go to a brick/mortar service that is ASE certified."
3,5,"Patrick is wonderful. He drove 45 minutes to fix the fuel pump in my car and it took him just about all day because my car is a problem child. Even my dad, who does nothing but complain about mechanics, was super impressed with Patrick and the Mobile Mechanic service. It probably cost more (or less, actually) than calling a tow-truck to get it towed to a shop and nothing was open today anyway so super grateful for this company.

We both highly recommend Mobile Mechanics and Patrick :)"
3,1,"I would not suggest this company.  I scheduled an afternoon appointment for 3pm thru their office.  At 3:15 I called their office to ask where was their tech?? They told me that he would be there in 15 minutes.  At 3:45, there is no tech and no phone call from their office.   I called them again and cancelled the appointment. 

In my opinion, they have poor customer service skills.  Also I was told they wanted payment in cash, if a credit card is used they will charge an extra 7% service fee."
3,1,"DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICES!!!!!!! They charged me $150 to come out and bleed my clutch, they then broke the bleeder valve off my brand new slave, I had just installed. I then had to drop my tranny again, get a new slave put in, then I called them to see if they would come back out, the owner was incredibly rude, hung up on me mid sentence after telling me to call the mechanic that worked on it. I called him(nice guy), he said he has to talk to his boss, he calls me back saying his ""boss wants another $75 to come out and try to bleed it again."""
3,1,"HORROR! These people are ridiculously over-priced, rude. inefficient and they do strange things with credit cards - then when you get in touch to clarify they disappear...:(( 
But they know how to inflate a tire!
NEVER AGAIN

Push your car back home if necessary.

3,1,"so sat we called the mobile mechanics of las vegas at 12 noon we were told they would be out within 20 mins 5 calls and 3 hours later they finally showed up the mechanic angel and his wife .he was very sloppy he even pulled the filter out to use as a arm rest . he didnt even know what he was doing he put the injector in wrong which lead to cracking the new injector then was leaning on the radiator and broke our perfectly good radiator then expected us to pay for it cus he had no money so we called the owner steve and said he o wow this went south so we gave the mechanic money for a new radiator and when he came back and we explained he broke and put the injector in wrong they were just worried about the money and left with our radiator that we paid for when we finally got back withthe owner he said he would send them back we said we just want our money back or the raditator  that we didnt want him to work on it any more they never showed back up at this point it was 9 oclock at night the owner never called us back we had to go buy another radiator and injector and had some help from a couple of local guys to fix it to get back on the road at 2 am to get home 500 miles away  it is now monday and still havent heard back from them and out $260 luckly my husband new what was wrong they could have really taken advantage of someone 
worst experiance ever dont trust  these guys"
2.5,3,"This is far from my favorite RV park. Although the grounds are clean and there are lots of amenities,  the office staff is curt and cold. In addition, both their and Good Sam's website advertise WIFI . What neither site tells you is that WIFI only available in clubhouse. Why would anyone want to stream movies, Netflix, etc, in an activity center? We will not stay there again"
4,5,"Thank you for all! Good RV, gentle staff ...great time. I hope to rent another time.  Hi from Italy"
4,5,"This is absolutely the best place to take your RV to get repaired, and I think that is mainly because of Becky at the service desk. She worked hard with us to get our motorhome fixed and on the road before May Long. She's resourceful and kind and she got our motorhome shower done on time. We trust her with our coach!"
2.5,1,"Horrible communication, 3 hours late and management at the office answering phones/booking appointments were incompetent and made the lamest excuses. Incredibly unprofessional in every aspect.

STAY AWAY from these guys and look elsewhere!"
2.5,5,"Have to say this is one of the most professional repair shops ive ever been too. Me and the girlfriend decided to have a weekend getaway so we decided to drive over from California. I recklessly forgot to tune up my car for the drive which lead to an issue with my motor. 

I called dozens of tow truck services who claimed they would be there within the hour and when none showed up i called here and was picked up in about 15 minutes. Staff was very friendly and super helpful drove us to the repair shop where the head mechanic inspected my vehicle and proceeded to tell me what was wrong. We went over prices for parts and they went in detail over my options (price range, parts and labor). The entire time we were there the staff offered us cool drinks, cool waiting area. Not your stereotypical greasy grimey shop super clean and again very proffesional. My repair was done in a timely fashion and when i went to pick it up it was spotless! This business truly does know the meaning of customer service and if im ever in the area and in need of repairs this will be my go-to spot! Highly recomend!"
2.5,1,"Called around to see if there was any place that had a scanner for a 7.3 power stroker The best thing I liked about this company as they have a mobile repair so they'll come out to your house the only problem was it's $100 just to come out and then to Scan the vehicle was $60 which wasn't a problem, i'm disappointed in the fact that they couldn't pull up in the information on my truck and told me that I need a new batteries which sounds very absurd so now I am out $160 for the things that I already knew."
2.5,1,"Patriot mobile repair also advertised as Arizona Sprinter Van Repair is a terrible company to deal with, I would give them no stars if I could. I spoke with Roger the owner and he seemed professional on the phone, but after my van sat there for a month and they would not return phone calls I was frustrated and set a meeting with Roger. I show up and he blew it off completely after I drove over there from the east valley with no phone call or anything. I cannot cautious enough on how unprofessional and a waste of time my experience was. Avoid at all costs."
5,5,"I rented the Eclipse for NASCAR and it was a great experience. I travel a fair amount for work and had a couple things come up that caused my pickup days to change. John was great working with me and accommodating my schedule. It is also the easiest as far as picking up and dropping off; his location has water and a dump station on site so you don't have to hunt around finding a place to fill up and empty the trailer.

The trailer was fantastic. I have rented from a few other people before and his trailer is by far the nicest. The slide in the eclipse really makes a big difference in the interior space as well. It really makes the difference having new trailers fully equipped with all the camping gear."
5,5,"After having rented from a different RV company last summer and having had a terrible experience, I was skeptical to rent again. My husband and I got in contact with John and could not have been more pleased with our experience. In fact, they exceeded our expectations. He provided a beautiful clean and stocked toy hauler for our family, excellent communication and service to the vehicle prior to us hitting the road. We will absolutely rent again and highly recommend this small, local business."
4.5,5,awesome customer service- rented a new rv everything went great :)))
4.5,1,Horrible! They made a mistake on our reservation and we now are stuck with out an RV for our spring break trip! Don't count on them if your trip is important!
4.5,5,"My Wife and I have always been tent camping people but this past weekend we went to Overland Expo in flag and we decided to rent a trailer, Not ever doing so before we were a little nervous about what to expect and the people at RV rental couldn't have been more helpful and reassuring to make it an awesome trip.  We are now trailer campers.  One person in particular took the time to make sure our truck was totally set up with all we needed to pull a 3500lb trailer, his name was Jamey and he was the biggest help in making us very comfortable.  We would definitely recommend RV rentals to anyone wanting to rent an RV!!!"
4.5,4,"Never rented an RV before - took a bet on RV Rental Outlet.  If you do, ask for Lance.  He was excellent from start to finish.  Walked me through the booking process easily enough, recommended the right additional options and helped me sign anything I'd missed [in advance] on the day of the rental.  Actual RV was as described at time of booking (pretty new and in great condition).  Good walk-through from Tim (I think) before driving off.  No issues in 500 mile journey - everything worked fine.  Lance inspected and closed out paperwork quickly on return.  I'd definitely use these guys again."
4.5,5,"I have a great experience with RV rental outlet. Their RV is nice and clean and they tried so hard to make your vacation into the best one. It's easy that you can add additional items to your rental, even it's the day before pick up. If you forget some paperwork. No problem. The staff are awesome and helpful. One of them that I highly appreciate is Lance. He is very nice and take you as his true good friend. This is my second time that I rent the RV from them. They are always the top choice. I would say this is the best RV company in the valley!"
4.5,5,"I am in the market for a toy hauler and want to rent a couple of times before I buy one.  
I did quite an extensive search for RV (Toy Hauler) rentals in the Phoenix area and arrived at RV Rental Outlet.  I had a hard time getting many other places just to return a phone call.  These guys answered every time.  They are a very professional outlet, have good well maintained equipment, and have good pricing.   They answered all my questions on several calls, including taking measurements so that I could verify that a side by side would actually fit inside.   
I  live in California, so did most of my dealings with them online and over the phone.  Their web site had most of the information that I needed, and phone calls got the rest.   I happened to be in Phoenix a few weeks before the rental , so I stopped by to pay the balance on the rental.  I was able to tour the unit I was renting and see many of the other equipment that they had, and they have a lot.  They also have a Huge maintenance shop.  There is no question that I was dealing with a solid company.
When I came in to pick up the toy hauler, they took good care of us, even though I was 2 hours late getting into town on the busiest rental day of the year, two days before Thanksgiving.  They test my trailer plug, installed a load leveling hitch, hooked up the trailer and got it all ready to go.  The toy hauler was clean, full of fluid, stocked with the linens, kitchen kit, etc that I had requested, and I was ready to go.
No problems at all on the trip.  Everything worked fine.  The return was fast and easy.  Since I am from out of town, I got the drop and go deal.  Worked out great.  Did not need to  spend vacation time cleaning, or dumping the tanks.
If I need to rent again in the Phoenix area, I will definitely call RV Rental Outlet."
4.5,5,"I found these guys 10 days before our road trip. They were hands down the most helpful and courteous individuals. Their pricing is extremely fair and we went with the GeoPro which worked very nicely with our SUV. We didn't even need to install separate brakes and it ran off our car's brakes. I felt comfortable driving the RV through cities and mountainsides. 

Jamie their handyman set everything up for us and went through the entire RV explaining how everything worked in detail. We were also given numbers in case anything went wrong. Their contract was very thorough which made me have full confidence in their company. 

I cleaned the trailer after the trip and we got our deposit back! I highly recommend these guys because they made our adventure forever memorable."
4.5,5,"We rented a towable for this past vacation.  The team at RV Rental Outlet made sure everything was hooked up properly prior to leaving and showed me how to work all the features of the trailer.  While camping with the trailer everything worked perfectly just as it had in Mesa before we left.
Thanks and we will be back."
4.5,1,"I reserved an RV in February of this year. I paid a 200.00 security deposit. Unfortunately, our plans changed and I called to cancel. When I called in the gentleman I spoke to said they will only refund 50%. Was not happy about that but, it is what it is. 

I called to cancel first week of March. I have not received my refund. It is now April 11th and I have called 3 times and cannot get a returned call. Take your business elsewhere... these guys are crooks!"
4.5,5,"Just finished a family trip and our experience was wonderful. Brand new and really clean RV's. Also, the staff was really nice and helpful. The whole experience was 5 star."
4.5,5,"I highly recommend RV Rental Outlet for your RV/trailer rental needs. They are trustworthy, reasonably priced, thorough and have a vast selection of RV/trailers. I dealt with Lance and couldn't be happier with the excellent customer service I received. I felt like I had a friend in the RV business. Jayme also walked us through the trailer on the pick up day and took the time to answer all our questions so we felt comfortable with how to operate things and all the features the trailer had. 

Originally, my wife and I tried to rent a trailer through RVshare. However, the guy on there tried to rip us off and nearly ruined our vacation. RV Rental Outlet helped us save our trip. Don't waste your time on RVshare go to RV Rental Outlet and get the RV/trailer that's right for you with the peace of mind you deserve. 

If I ever rent/buy an RV/ trailer I will be sure to come to RV Rental Outlet. Now I recommend RV Rental Outlet to all of my friends. Thank you RV Rental Outlet for helping make our vacation possible and much more enjoyable!"
4.5,5,Konnor Jackson is the man to see! He hooked us up with an awesome rv and now our trip is going to be extra rad!
4.5,5,"Had a nice experience thus far with RV Rental--we had a last minute need for a production office and Konnor was super helpful.

Highly recommend"
4.5,5,"Great experience dealing with a nice group of people.  It was very nice dealing with Lance and Jamey.  Easy/quick technical instructions by Jamey.  My first experience with a C Class was a pleasure / easy to drive.  Because they only stock new model RVs milage is limited, so regional trips are best, but if you have to go over the 125 miles alloted a day their price per mile is reasonable.
Tip: Be sure to know where to fill up the internal propane tank if you camp somware cold, this is your only heat source.  Filling locations can be hard to find in certain locations."
4.5,5,"My husband and I rented an RV for thanksgiving, we only needed it for 3 days but because of timing with scheduling a pickup or drop off, we needed to have it for longer. Because of the holiday and the fact they were very busy, we were given the RV for a full week! Paid for 3 days and got 7! I feel beyond blessed! They were so accommodating and easy going-I just couldn't believe it! Lance was awesome to work with and so was everyone else I talked to. Just great people! I didn't even have to go pick up or return the RV, their team came straight to me and it was so easy!
RV condition:
..Was great, normal wear and tear is expected. We did have outrageous rattling when we drove it but realized it was the microwave that had a missing screw so the whole metal piece was making some crazy loud noises and close to falling off. I had to duct tape it to stop the noise. The light above the driver seat was broken and never turned off so we had to use duct tape to cover the brightness so we could see to drive at night. The door handle of the bathroom completely fell off because of a loose screw...
These issues were minor but they just might need to do a few more often than maintenance checks for things like tightening screws and checking lights. 

Overall the RV got tons of complements and many of our RV-owning family members are now considering upgrading theirs to a similar model!!! We were the envy of the group! 


Thank you RV rental outlet! We will definitely be using you again next thanksgiving!"
4.5,4,We worked with Jamey to learn about the features of the camper...he was awesome and made sure we were comfortable with everything before we left the lot. He met us upon our return to check us back in.
4.5,5,We rented a tear drop and it was perfect for our needs. Very adorable. Jamey was very helpful. They made sure we had every thing we needed. We will definitely be repeat customers!
4.5,5,"Renting from this company was an absolutely amazing experience. Lance literally saved the family vacation that was planned months in advance, with family coming in from New England. After another company was unable to follow through with the reservation, my wife called Lance and got us an RV that day, which was no easy task as Country Thunder made it difficult to find RV's to rent. 

Lance is an example of someone who cares about his career, company, and customer service. The RV he found us was near new and fit all the needs for 7 people road tripping it. 

A++++ and 5 star service. 

Thank you Lance!

Ryan + family"
4.5,5,We have rented twice now from RV Rental Outlet.  Both times we have had a great experience with no issues.  The trailer we got was properly outfitted and they gave us a nice walk through of all of the features.  We will definitely rent from them again for our annual camping trip.
4.5,5,We rented a Mighty Lite travel trailer over the July 4th week and had a blast.  This was our first time ever renting an RV but Lance made the experience fun and his attention to detail gave us the confidence we needed to venture out.  We had so much fun we have already booked our second excursion and are looking forward to many more in the future.  The customer service that Lance delivers makes this a great company to rent from!
4.5,1,"Would never rent from them again. We rented the Sunseeker 26ft motor home for 3 days Labor Day weekend. Generator went out after 2 hours. Called. No help. I finally figured out it was the breaker. The cover which is supposed to close on the bottom of the toilet did not fit right.....so fumes of poop filled the RV and flies came crawling out of the toilet. We had to put a towel in the toilet to stop the smell. We couldn't use the toilet after that. The dump hose for the grey water and the sewage had 20 cracks in it. So when you dumped the water, it poured out all over the ground near your RV. Big mess. Water was pouring out of side of the RV, where you connect the to the water tank. So the water tank was always empty. So we had no water, unless we were connected to the campground. Basically, the whole weekend was a big disaster. When I returned the RV. They didn't want to do anything for compensation. Finally they gave me $75 refund (which is pennies considering the amount of money I just spent) after I complained and waited around. Very bad attitude and bad service and total apathy to my headaches. Oh yes, while I was waiting for my big $75 refund. The man next to me, was complaining that his RV had a flat and there was no spare tire in the rig and the jack was broken! The sales person handed him a coupon for a free day rental. That is ridiculous, not to have a spare tire and a broken jack. Big safety issue!"
4.5,5,"Great Experience!! We rented a toy hauler for the family to camp up the mountains this Labor Day weekend. The unit was clean and performed well. We slept 6 people in in the toy hauler and all were comfortable. The price was good, compared to others in my the area. A special ""Thank You"" to Lance. He was awesome in helping us select a camper and working with our busy schedule. We look forward to renting again from this business. Highly Recommended."
4.5,5,We rented an RV from here for a camping trip over Thanksgiving and had a great experience. The people in the office were extremely nice and helpful. The RV was in great condition. The staff were very helpful in making sure we knew exactly how everything worked before we drove off the lot so that we didn't have any problems when we were out on the road. I will certainly come back the next time we decide to take an RV trip.
4.5,5,"I knew from the second I got off the phone with them that I had found my place to rent an RV.  I started off with submitting a request online with a few RV companies in the area.   Lance from RV Rental Outlet was the first to call me back from all of these companies and was more than helpful about leading me in the right direction not only with the RV to rent, but some assistance with my trip as well. 

Once I arrived, the entire staff there was excellent and extremely informative.  Things were done quickly and they were able to give me a great tutorial of the RV and how it worked.  In addition, they were available IMMEDIATELY whenever I had any questions about the RV, even if It was late at night.  

I will without a doubt go back to them for any RV rentals in the future."
4.5,5,"GO HERE FIRST.  You wont be disappointed.

Just a quick note to say that I had a great experience with the RV Rental Outlet.  These folks rent quality equipment and they are great to do business with.  I am a return customer and have to hand it to Kam and Lance.  Both of these folks take the time to make sure you have the best experience possible.  Great customer service."
4.5,5,"Great customer service. Really organized. We rented a few times from them with great success and convenience. Tim was really friendly and easy to work and hooked us up with a fair deal. The RV's were in really great condition, clean and spotless. Felt like it was my own vehicle. The service guys step you through the basics and are also very professional and friendly. We trust them and will continue to rent from them."
4.5,5,"The guys at RV rental outlet were absolutely wonderful. We were driving from San Diego to pick up the trailer and hit some epic Phoenix traffic. Even though we arrived just before closing, Jamie couldn't have been nicer. He gave us a tour of the trailer & set up my SUV with a hitch and hooked the trailer up. . . Only to find out that my truck had electrical issues.  Lance & Roger got out of their cars and came to our aid but they determined that it couldn't be fixed, and there was no way we could tow the trailer. Kam generously offered to tow it for us, all the way to Glendale. Lance, Kam, Jamie and Roger all went above and beyond to make sure that our vacation wasn't ruined. You just don't get that kind of treatment with most businesses today. Thank you so much to everybody at RV rental outlet."
4.5,5,"Lance did an awesome job for us.  We are new to pulling a trailer and he went over everything, answered all the questions and was always helpful and thorough.  Great experience and we have already booked out next rental!"
4.5,5,"Second time I have rented from this business.  Well, outstanding customer service from Lance Gorder.   I mean the guy did me a great favor and was flexible in my return time.  Plus Lance actually engages the customer and we had a few laughs.

The campers are always in working order for me and clean for the most part.

Question you maybe asking is, ""would I rent from them again?""  The answer is yes!!"
4.5,5,"Lance was really a great help, I was able to make the reservation ONLY a couple of hours before I needed the RV. I've rented many RV's in the past and it couldn't be any smoother!

I'm definitely coming back"
4.5,5,We just got back from our trip to CA and everything went great.  We really appreciate the personalized service we received and the large selections of motor homes to choose from.  I would definitely recommend using RV Rental Outlet.
4.5,5,"Hi this RV  rental is the best in Arizona. All the stuff is helpful and that is a guy his name is Lance he helped me a lot and he gave me a discount on me RV. 
Thanks Lance."
4.5,5,"Lance, and the personnel are excellent. Great experience! The rv were in excellent condition, everything work out grea!"
4.5,4,Lance took good care to make sure I had everything needed for a hassle free week camping in the woods with my family! Thanks
4.5,5,"Lance, Kam and Jamie really took care of me! I had an early November Deer hunt and the wife threw a last second requirement on the trip.... indoor plumbing! NASCAR was coming to PIR and all the RVs and Trailers were reserved. I searched the valley for something affordable and with only a couple days left before the trip Kam was able to secure a Mighty Lite M12 travel trailer with a complete bathroom (with shower!). When I arrived to pick up the trailer I had the wrong sized ball hitch... and I left the anti theft lock key at the house... no worries! Jamie helped swap out the ball so I was still in the game. Check in and check out was a breeze. Lance had everything set up with the paperwork. If I hadn't talked his hear off about deer hunting and gun calibers I probably could have been in and out within 20 minutes total time! Even though I struck out on deer we had a great time. The trip was a success! All thanks to the guys at RV Rental Outlet in Mesa. I posted this review after my trip but I noticed it wasn't on their Yelp reviews. Pretty sure it was my fault, I just want to make sure they know I am grateful for the great customer service!"
4.5,5,"I had a wonderful experience using RV rental outlet. I have never rented an RV and they were able to accommodate my small suv with an appropriate sized trailer. They even fixed my trailering light connection. Unfortunately, when I got to the campground I found that the battery was dead. I called Lance, who quickly directed me to a local store where I could change the battery. He offered to send somebody out to do it for me, but it wasn't necessary as I could change a battery. When it was time to return the RV, Lance offered to have somebody pick up the trailer from my home as compensation for my troubles. I thought this was above and beyond good customer service. I would absolutely rent from them again and refer any of my friends to them for RV rentals!!"
4.5,5,"Back in Dec 2016 I was trying to find a RV rental company that would rent a camping trailer to my wife and I to take a 6 week trip starting May 1, 2017 through June 14. Nobody would even consider renting to me once I said I have dogs. When I found Rv Rental Outlet in Mesa, AZ it was amazing. I spoke with Brittany Khalil who was so awesome! She explained that as long as there was a security deposit I could take my two Labrador dogs. Not one company would even entertain the idea of security deposit when I shopped around. And here is the amazing part. Rv  Rental Outlet totally kicked Butt on the rental price beating all other quotes I received. Brittany went out of her way to make our rental experience so great that I can't say enough good things about them. Please, if you need to rent a camper or RV, contact Brittany at Rv Rental Outlet, she will go out of her way to take care of you!"
4.5,4,"I rented a RV through RV Rental Outlet for Burning Man in 2014, so this is a belated but heartfelt good review. Lance was the main person I worked with and he was fantastic. He is customer oriented and was great about answering my endless questions and about returning calls. He was professional, helpful, knowledgeable and always a pleasure to talk to. He provided A+ service. I also had the pleasure of having other folks at RV Rental Outlet help me, and everyone was always eager to please.

The RV itself was in decent condition and the team did their best to ensure we were in good shape to travel. There were a few kinks, but honestly, nothing to complain about. Those kinks are just the only thing keeping this from being a five star rating. However, Lance and the RV Rental Outlet team did everything in their power to get us spiffed up and on our way. They couldn't have been more accommodating. I've rented RVs from a few different sources, and I have yet to rent one that is perfect. That said, the service here was perfect, and that counts for a lot.

Many outlets won't consider renting to Burners, and if they do, they try to gouge them in any way possible. I felt these folks treated us with respect and like their regular customers. If you treat their RVs well, they will treat you well.

A thumbs up for RV Rental Outlet."
4.5,1,"We were looking at the little tear drop ""Five-Wide"" trailer. A friend has one and we covet it every time we see it.  We found one on RV Rental Outlet's website and after three calls connected with someone to talk to.  The price on the web is $165/weekend, but the online booking tool calculates it as $165/night.  The very pleasant person on the phone quotes the price of $165 for the weekend but added a $29 ""prep"" fee.  And of course tax.  The prep fee is not optional, so the real price is $195.   

This deceptive pricing infuriates me; if they lie in their advertising, what else do they lie about? We won't be renting or buying from this outfit."
4.5,5,"I just rented a 26 ft Class-C rental from RV Rental Outlet and had a great experience. The process went smoothly and the staff was very professional. The RV's they rent are new and the one I rented was a 2017 with 6,000 miles on it. I had never rented an RV before and they gave a nice orientation on the RV to go over everything. Their rates were also very competitive. Definitely will be coming back to rent for future trips from them."
4.5,5,"These guys are outstanding. The service and quality of the RVs is top notch.  Our trip was the first time for us to rent and everything went great.  We took a trip up to the Grand Canyon and then over to Monument Valley. Lance and the rest of the crew are terrific and made sure we were completely set up.  Don't risk going to another supplier, these guys are the very best. Highly recommended and will use them again."
4.5,5,"Super friendly and helpful team.  As first time RV renters, Lance helped us navigate the entire process.  Big kudos to Shauna for saving our daughter's beloved toy pet dog we left behind in the lobby--traumatic melt down avoided!  Thank you for all of your help team!"
4.5,5,"Rented a 24' C Class for 4 days over the Fourth of July. This is the third place I've rented an RV from, and far away the best experience yet. Lance is awesome. Easy pickup and drop off and no BS or hidden charges. If you're in the east Scottsdale vicinity, head south to rent, not south east or north west (:-))"
4.5,5,We rented an RV for 3 nights for spring break and were very happy with it! The service was great - professional and helpful. We also loved the RV itself - we cooked a lot in it and it comfortably fit our family of four (my kids loved the side pop-out feature). We highly recommend RV Rental Outlet!
4.5,5,"This was our first time renting RVs for a family vacation and we were not disappointed.  Seven us flew into Arizona from Connecticut and met up with 4 more people from Mesa.  Together we rented 2 bunk house RVs and traveled to the Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde Colorado and Sedona.  5 adults and 6 kids -ranging in age from 7 to 15 - had the time of our lives.  Camping in these full service RVs was fun and relatively worry free. We had a minor glitch with one of the generators but Lance and his team were very responsive to our issues.  We would recommend RV Rental Outlet to any of our friends looking for an adventure and would definitely do this again!"
4.5,1,"We had a very unpleasant experience renting from RV Rental Outlet in the spring of this year.  We chose this place as they were one of the few that had smaller trailers for rent.  When we got to our first night's destination (about 15 minutes away), we realized that the awning did not work (90 degrees plus weather),  the table was broken and not usable, the fresh water connection had a major leak due to a missing washer, the dumping hose provided in the unit had a collar pulled loose from the connection.   To their credit, a technician was sent out within a few hours but he wasn't able to rectify the awning issue.  The next day we called the outlet and it was insinuated that we had done something to damage the awning on our 15 minute drive to our destination via city streets.   This really ticked us off; they didn't want to accept any responsibility.  The awning couldn't be fixed so we proceeded on our trip and found these additional deficiences:  1)  no radio as advertised  2) leaking faucets and broken shelves  3) filthy cutting boards  4) wrong size spare tire requiring an additional trip back to the agency  5)  clean water hose and dirty water hose stored in the same bag/ very unsanitary.   We've rented units before and have never had issues such as these.  

Also to their credit, they did give us one day's rent reimbursement for the hours we had to spend waiting for several techs to come out plus driving back to the agency for the correct spare tire.  For that, we're giving them one star.   We're thankful we didn't have any issues that compromised our safety but we would not rent from them again."
4.5,5,"I've rented from RV Rental Outlet twice.  Both times we drove from San Diego in our truck, picked up our Travel Trailer in Mesa, and then drove to Rancho Sedona RV Park.  We love not having to pull the RV for the entire trip and being able to drop it off and go.  Great prices, great service.  Staff does a run through on how to work everything before you leave.  We have our next trip for 2018 reserved and ready to go.  Both times, everything was working in the RV and trip went as expected.  Love RV Rental Outlet and looking forward to our next trip.  As expected, you need your own linens, pans, etc, but I think they might have a package to get everything you need if you don't want to bring your own."
4.5,5,"Just got back from out trip to Havasu. We rented a R.V. with the help of  Lance G,and  he was very helpful and worked with us to help find the perfect R.V. My family and I had a great time. R.V. was very clean and in great condition. We will definitely rent again from RV Rental Outlet in the near future. Once again, Thank you Lance G for everything you do for our family."
4.5,5,Kam took my reservation for an RV over fall break 2015.  He was awesome. Super friendly service.  For a 2013 Coachmen the rental was in pretty good shape. These guys are awesome!  Will return in the future.
4.5,1,"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY. Rented an rv for 16 nights.  Day one, took 3 hours to get the coach.  day 2, Traveled from Phx to Lake Pleasant Rd before the first breakdown..sat for 4 hours waiting for a repairman. leaky fuel lines which was a known problem the week before but the company chose to only replace 3 of the 6 lines. After repairs we traveled 40 miles before all power was lost. this was due to fuel shorting out the ecm. again could have been prevented. we sat 4 1/2 hours..The company brought us a new coach and was so proud because this one was supposed to be superior to what we rented..of course we had to ignore the sewage smell because they did not have the part to repair the fan before bringing the rv to us..they also did not have time to clean it.
 We were able to travel to Utah before finding out both steer tires were bad. replacing tires $1500. 
Bought Rv back and spoke to owner Mike Ciardullo. He said ""sorry"" didn't seem like he meant it tho. Explained how we just got unlucky, all this has happened to him, just on multiple trips. After all it is summer and they are busy.  so for endangering our lives,  my granddaughters lives, our inconvience, and smelling sewage for 15 days we asked for $1500 refund. Mike thought that was excessive and offered $1000.00.
We accepted his offer since he has to take care of his motorcycle and just paid $20,000 to fix his boat..wouldn't want to put him in a bind financially.

Also advised him the roadside assistance program which we paid $374 for was not much assistance. His response was..... he has not had any problems with them and he gets the policy from friends of his..sorry for stepping on toes..

Renting from this company put my family's lives in danger. The RV's are not well maintained ( we had 2 different ones).  If an owner of a company doesn't care, then no one at that company will care and by my perspective this owner could care less once he gets your money.."
5,5,Mark & Mike rock! They give great service for a great price & will be our go-to guys whenever we're in Vegas. Certified RV technicians and entrepreneurs; a great combination.
5,5,Mark and Micheal did a nice job in replacing the fabric on our RV'S awnings yesterday.  Last night after I dropped my Dad off at the airport I managed to lose power to everything in the RV.  I called Desert RV and they came by and showed me a fuse I didn't know about.  Great customer service.
5,5,"Great people to work with, on time and very knowledgeable about what they do. Reasonably priced and didn't feel taken advantage of. Highly recommended"
5,5,"My frig stopped working on our last trip and I had very little time to get my camper into a dealer to have it looked at. I saw that these guys offered mobile repair which was a great solution. I contacted them at the listed phone number and got a text reply which said they were a week out on appointments. That worked fine with me and gave me some confidence that they were doing good work. I think all communication was by text which I found convenient. They (Mark) showed up a little late for the appointment but that is understandable doing this type of field work. Mark very quickly diagnosed the issue and gave me very helpful information on how to avoid future problems. I will definitely use them for all future needs. Mark is knowledgeable, friendly, and responsive; I enjoyed doing business with him."
5,5,"Great company!  I scheduled an appointment, they confirmed the appointment the day before, they arrived on-time and were able to fix my heater in no time.  Superb customer service and one of the best RV repair experiences I've had!"
5,5,The guys at Desert Mobile RV Repair are two of the nicest guys you will ever meet. They have excellent customer service and do a top notch  job doing the repairs. I would recommend Desert Mobile RV  to anyone that needs work done on their rv. Thanks Guys!!!
5,5,"This is a quality, very honest company that is a pleasure to do business with. If you have spent anytime on the road RVing you quickly discover it is very difficult to find qualified, honest professional RV Techs. These guys fill the bill! We have spent the winter this year in Las Vegas and have had occasion to use them on two different issues. On time, great communication, fixed the issue, reasonable rates. 5 STARS"
5,5,"I have been RVing since 81. So when I need a system I have a backup. I am in the middle of the desert and 1 of my ACs went out. Since I have a backup AC system I was able to maintain livable temps inside barely and I needed help. 
I called the guys at Desert Mobile RV Repair  since they were one of the highest rated. 
Let me tell you... the high rating is well deserved!
I had made an appointment with them for a coming Monday to look at the AC intending to stay in the mountains until then. But I was able to get into Las Vegas on Friday. 
I messaged on Wednesday and they had time for me on Friday. 
I stayed up in the mountains then made the 3 hour trip down to the desert. It was 117 outside!
I let them know what site I was in and they were there in 45 minutes. 15 minutes later the AC was working again!
A wire had grounded out they told me. Had it been the compressor it would have been a new AC.
The result? A minimum Half hour charge as opposed to a new AC! 
Very very knowledgeable, trustworthy, honest and dependable! Everything an excellent business should be. 
Thanks guys!"
5,5,"Matt and his crew are amazing, trailer was new but after it is now a true reflection, as you can see yourself in it. The truck a 2016 Black 3500 Chevy, total different truck Matt and his crew did a amazing job on it. Very happy with Bob Mose Ceramic Coating"
5,5,Picked up the General from Bob Moses Ceramic Coating today and it honestly looks 10 times better than the day I drove it out of the dealership! Thanks Matthew Moses for making it happen on such short notice!
5,5,Great people to work with.  They keep their commitments no matter the weather and keep you informed.   Great job on the coating.
5,5,"I have been having our cars waxed twice a year here in the AZ sunshine and have been looking for a good long term alternative, and boy did I find it. I had my wifes new Maxima ceramic coated by the good guys at Bob Moses Ceramic coating and I cannot believe how shiny her car is. When we bought the car I did not even realize that the paint had pearl in it but after the two coats of ceramic it dazzles in the sun. 

Now about the service itself, Matt and his guys kept up to date on the progress and every little detail as they corrected the paint (minimal but still important on even a new car) and applied the ceramic. Epic level of service.

I figure I will not have to wax her car for at least four years @400.00 a year that is going to save me at least 800.00 and really help with trade value as the car is going to look as good as it did when I bought it."
5,5,Had our work trailer ceramic coated and it looks amazing. Very impressed with the customer service and quality of work. We will be back for sure.
5,5,Had my 28 ft toy hauler done came out looking amazing and it is so much easier to clean and peace of mind knowing that it is protected from the elements
5,5,"Happy with quality of work from Bob Moses Ceramic Coating - it was definitely worth the extra drive and cost for someone who really takes the time to make sure everything is perfect. The product used really sets him apart from the competition - a really classy service experience, would recommend to anyone interested in protecting your vehicle or RV. Just did my 18 F-250 Platinum truck, next up is my RV."
3.5,5,"Unbelievable service I experienced yesterday.  They gave me hope in customer service!   I took my RV in for repairs for my generator, which my RV Dealer worked on twice, only to make it inoperable.  I was so impressed with Amber, their Service Supervisor.  She went far and beyond in getting me back on the road and her Manager and Repair Tech were great and informative.  I would highly recommend them for any work needed on your diesel or generator.  They surely make you feel at home."
3.5,1,"Can't work on a 1984 Cummins, what kind of certified Cummins shop doesn't work on old rigs, they tell me to use the Avondale location or a private shop."
5,5,"Chad did a great job for me on my RV. removed deep scratch, on time, and has great pricing! I will definitely use Touch-Up-Pro again, Tim"
5,5,"Honest professionals. Highly recommend! 
I inquired about fixing some scratches my vehicle had obtained and instead of dishonesty quoting me and going straight for the job. They recommend I seek other options that might be less costly and as effective. (I know nothing of cars nor paint for that matter) I highly appreciate their attentiveness and honesty. Thank you so much"
5,5,I just had him do my car front bumper and my wife's rear bumper.  Great job and way less then what the dealership wanted.  i was also impressed that he came to our house and did all the taping and stuff right there and had a shade system and did all the painting on the spot.  I'm probably the most happy that there was no over spray on my wife's trunk lid like the last time I took it to a place in Tempe.  they were reasonable but i got what i paid for. ugh I forgot their name but am keeping Chad's card.  He's reasonable and very good.
4,5,I have been going to Prime Design since they opened and I am ALWAYS very pleased with my service. Ernie & his crew are definitely top notch! I own 3 gourmet food trucks and I always count on Prime Design for the most professional service in the industry!
4,1,"Prime design is a type of company that value making money and profit over taking care of people and doing quality work.
  If you decide to do business with them just make sure you're aware off their business practices they will try to cut corners and misguide you to make more money out of you I will not be recommending this company to anyone based on my own experience"
4,5,"Ernie and his staff are top notch. We own Tikiz Shaved Ice & Ice Cream in Arizona, but our truck was lacking A/C. Ernie & his crew modified and installed a great system for us which looks great too. We are now going to be chilling' this summer. Great workmanship & very professional. Prime Design Food Trucks & Trailer Repair is the place to go whether you're starting from the ground-up, need repairs, or additions with any food truck, trailer or concession cart."
4,5,Go here! Ernie knows his stuff. Great pricing and customer service. The quality of work these guys do is best in the industry. Check them out. You will be glad you did.
4,2,"As I said previously, the extra money we spent was an extra $20K which I don't think was warranted. Since this was our first food trailer, we trusted that Ernie and Jaimie knew best. After we got the trailer and saw what other people had which was very similar to ours and paid a lot less, we realized that we were really overcharged for a lot of things. Also, the fact that Ernie did not mention to us to get a sway bar was not very professional on his end. We had an accident the same day we picked up the trailer due to not having a sway bar. Plus all 4 tires blew off, which were the wrong size for that trailer!!! We are very lucky to be alive. That is his responsibility as a retailer to tell people that they should buy one. He recommended everything else, why not this?

""The lack of warnings given by manufacturers and retailers within the trailer industry about trailer sway and the lack of instruction on what to do if trailer sway occurs. Often these cases involve allegations that a vehicle towing a trailer rolled over after the trailer being towed began swaying uncontrollably. Consumers who are not warned or adequately instructed on the dangers of trailer sway, the options for eliminating it, and how to deal with it, could have a lawsuit against the manufacturers and retailers. Trailer sway must be taken seriously and the public must be made aware of what they are facing when towing a trailer"""
4,5,"Ernie is awesome did some work for me and exceeded my expectations.  And great prices I would definitely recommend him to anyone.  
Paul Thier Owner of Chef2U."
4,1,"Our situation was similar to the post below. We started out with a quote for $40K, but when all was said and done we wind up paying $62K. The same thing, once we started, Ernie would then call us and say you know you need a bigger generator, so that's an extra $5000. Then ""oh yeah, you need an additional this and that"" going on and on about all the things we needed extra. We never got a formal quote either, which is on us, so make sure you get everything in writing. We just got email quotes from Jaime, his assistant and they were not individually priced. He bunched it all together showing a number at the bottom so you really didn't know what you were paying for each item. We live in CA and when we scheduled an appointment to go see how the trailer was coming along, we made an appointment with Ernie only to find out when we got there he had something else to do and did not show up.The trailer we did purchase had the wrong size wheels on it and they put in a refrigerator instead of a freezer so we lost all of our product due to this mistake!!!   Still waiting to see if they make good on it, so far just being ignored. We are very disappointed in the customer service and would definitely not recommend Prime Design. I agree with the one customer who said they e just value making money over taking care of people. They charge you for the best but give you inferior product."
4,5,"We are so grateful that we found Prime Design.  Ernie, from the very beginning was extremely honest, friendly, and never seemed to be irritated by my many questions.  Ernie far exceeded our expectations or desires.  I would highly recommend Ernie and Prime Design to build your Food Truck.  We will be the envy here in Albuquerque.  We will be setting the standard for Food Trucks."
4,5,Can't even begin to describe how awesome it is to have a company like prime design close by. We had a huge festival and our generator cord ripped blowing the lines to my lights and eliminating my power. I called Ernie at 6am and by 7am him and another awesome mechanic did an emergency call and came to us and were working on getting us back up. With out Ernie there's no way we could have made it. This is one of many times these guys have gotten me out of a bind. I highly recommend Prime design. Not only am i a huge fan of their work but truly consider them friends and family. Thank you !!!
2,1,"Worst buying experience of my life. No kidding around. Prep not done with any ""honesty and integrity"" as they so prominently advertise. Had to go full force and involve the owner to get anything taken care of. Registration and tags took a month. ""We do them in batches once a week"" was the explanation. Really?  Can't imagine they sell so many they can't process them once a day. I demanded hand delivery of my tags so that I could leave on my trip on time. Sure, Jayco has a 2-year warranty, but who buys an RV to keep it in the shop instead of RVing?  Such is the status quo and it's shameful."
2,1,"I I paid these guys 35,000 for a Jayco trailer and when I brought it in for the first service they can only fix the things they decided they were responsible for. The problem is they did not put down the leveling gear on the unit and one arm was slightly damaged so the first time we took it out we noticed it so we brought it back and they refuse to fix it . They were the only Jayco dealer with this unit  if I could find the same unit at another dealer I would have jumped on it , so I was kind of railroaded into buying the trailer there but if you find the same trailer at another dealer I would suggest you go with that dealer it will save you in the long run.
Arizona native 46 years"
3.5,2,"If you have 5 months to wait for your service to be completed, then this just might be the place for you!  Unfortunately, I would have liked my vehicle back months before that!  They did manage to fix most of things we asked of them and my husband was satisfied with the work.  I honestly think that they should have offered us some kind of discount off of our $2000 bill since it was 5 months after we dropped it off.  I would not return to this repair shop for any further work."
3.5,5,Had an intermittent issue with my 2003 Southwind RV. I was extremly impressed with Double Eagles patience and knowledge in repairing such a difficult problem. They are always curtious and polite. I would highly recommend Double Eagle RV.
3.5,5,"Had a couple of issues with jacks and stairs. All the big RV chain repair shops in the area were disinterested or quoted us days until the work could be done( were from out of town). Double Eagle took us right in fixed the problem and has us on our way. Not the fanciest shop in Vegas but, based on the four I dealt with today definitely the best."
3.5,1,"Being a small business owner, I never write scathing reviews. I was so insulted, that has changed. I run my business out of my RV. I set an appointment in the middle of the week and cleared my work schedule to allow for repairs. The next day I went to pick up my business and not only had they done absolutely nothing to it, they had called in a competitor to gossip about me. The mechanic Fernando even tried the old cover your hand in axle grease and yell ""we have a problem"". Oldest trick in the mechanics book and typically reserved for people they think are idiots. All said, it cost me $120 just to park with them overnight and several grand in business. I sincerely hope this review costs them as much business as their immature games cost me. NEVER USE THEM."
3.5,5,"Thank You, Thank You.  AC heat pump went out just when we arrived in Vegas when temperatures were unreasonable warm.  Double Eagle diagnosed problem, dealt with difficult extended warranty company, ordered part and fixed quickly.  You guys rock!"
3.5,1,Went past the original agreement. Should get permission before taking the engine apart.
3.5,1,"I took my Toy hauler for new battery and generator problems. they cleaned the carb didn't replace carb parts but did install a new battery. I was quoted $523. when I came to pick it up the bill was $748. I showed them the written quote of $523. but he did not honor that. I picked it up that night.
 I didn't see the damage until the next morning. They cut my wiring and taped it up they also bent my adjustable stand and never told me. 
I will never take it to them again.. Beware of that place new owners and they are way tooo expensive and do low quality work!! !!"
3.5,1,"Did not do some of the things they charged for, and some of the stuff they did do, they did not do correct. Had take take RV to another shop for stuff they messed up. Think some of these online reviews are plants, or maybe they just rip off every other customer. Look elseware."
3.5,5,"We had traveled from Seattle, WA to Las Vegas in our 3 year old Class B Sprinter Van Motorhome and had a particularly grueling trip only to find that the tire shop that had done an alignment on our rig had smashed the tailpipe of the propane generator flat up against the bottom so it would't run.

We tried a number of places in the Las Vegas area but none of them seemed to want to work on our rig,--or they couldn't handle it for weeks.  Without the generator, we couldn't boondock, and some of our plans involved that, so we were kind of stranded.

Double Eagle not only was willing to work on our rig, but they did it fairly quickly and their pricing was fair to boot.

Our experience was excellent with these folks."
3.5,5,"We have an older RV that needs patience and creativity -- that is just what Double Eagle excels at.  We aren't in a rush and don't need a fancy facilities.  We would much rather have knowledgeable, experienced, and reasonably priced expertise willing to work with us."
3.5,1,"We were having a problem and they were working on an RV next to ours.  They charged us $154.00 and didn't fix anything.  In fact they caused another problem that I had to fix.  They recommended that we take it to them so they could fix it.  They diagnosed the problem, however, it was the wrong diagnoses.  Johnny Walker RV took the RV and had it fixed in a 1/2 hour and they only charged us $54.00.  I will never use these people again and I will never recommend them.  They caused more problems and fixed nothing."
3.5,1,This place is full of unprofessional uneducated and disrespectful thieves! This shop is unprofessional and unsafe they dumped a gas tank in the back of the shop and also drained antifreeze in the side lot! Don't trust them!
3.5,5,"Our maiden voyage in our new rig and as luck would have it, our slide out got stuck !  As we were passing through, they saw us last minute and fixed it for a very reasonable rate!  It doesn't have all the glitz and glamour of some other rv places, but honest, friendly, invaluable service wins every time!  Thank you Kathy!"
3.5,1,"I try to make a point of finding something positive in every experience, but these guys... sheesh.   When we balked at leaving our RV overnight  before anything had been done, we were told they had an ""overnight"" mechanic who was gonna be working on it.  Yeah, now I type it I know how stupid that sounds.  We were promised it would be ready by 12pm next day.  Time rolls around, no call, nothing - husband goes down there and NOTHING.  No one had even looked at it. Charged us a diagnostic fee to get our vehicle back, even though they had diagnosed nothing.   Don't waste your time."
4,5,"Call me Dee,

I don't do reviews but with this one I had to because:

I went to a local auto garage ""Good****"" Auto"" and they wanted about $1,200 to replace my rack n pinon. I called Mobile car doc and John found the problem right away. It was not the rack n Pinon but a leak in the power steering unit. John saved me over $1,000. 

So when I wanted a tune up on the same vehicle  It was a know brainier to call him back. And yes he saved me money again!

Next project A/C and you know who I'm going to call for that.....


Thanks John for your help you rock!!!

4,1,"I will never use this company ever again and I certainly would not recommend this company to anyone ever. Six months ago I took my daughter in-law's 2000 Buick Century in for over heating issues and was told it needed a new water pump and a new radiator with a complete coolant flush.Cost me over $800.00. A week later the serpentine belt snapped due to the fact that the mechanic didn't tighten the bolts on the water pump properly. Six months after that it began  overheating again. We decided to go back and check the water pump again and discovered that it was rusted inside. Upon inspecting the radiator we discovered heavy sludge in the bottom of the radiator and no bolts securing the cooling fans. Long story even longer we had to replace and flush the entire cooling system. They may have caused permeate damage do to their incompetence.... Nothing makes me anymore angry than getting taken advantage of by a dishonest and lazy mechanic. Not to mention that they lost the only ignition key we had and they had to scramble just to find a lock smith to fix that screw up. I kept all the parts we had to replace and I'm consulting an attorney for further action. This company needs to make things right, but I'm sure they won't."
4,5,"It's hard to find a good, honest mechanic and when I saw reviews I knew I needed to give Mobile Car Dr a whirl. I'm so happy I called. A mechanic came to my house while k was working, let me know what he was doing and went about his work. When it was all said and done the job performed was better than even my Toyota Dealership and k got to stay home and go about my day instead of waiting around at a mechanic shop for hours. I'd refer anyone here and definitely use their mechanics again."
4,5,"Wow.  What a great experience!  Never even thought of a mobile mechanic before today.  

Visiting Scottsdale from So Cal this week and had a power steering pump fail.  Stranded, I looked around to find a place with the least likelihood of getting taken.  I have no knowledge of reputable mechanics in the area.  Hoping to avoid a tow to an unknown dealer where the price would be inspiringly high, searching internet reviews, I found these guys.  I am blessed.  

Called on a Friday morning, connected immediately with Tristan (the owner) who dispatched David to my location in just two hours.  Two hours later, the truck is back in business.  All at prices my 25 year mechanic back home said I should expect!  And I didn't have to pay for, or be inconvenienced by, a tow.  Lovely!  

I drive a 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 4x4 5.9l Cummins Diesel.  A fixed base mechanic of high repute, based on ""best in arizona mechanic ratings,"" here in Scottsdale would not look at it for five days.  And then, he said because it is diesel, they'd probably send it to a dealer.  When I asked which dealer, he didn't know.  Epic Fail!

It is a wonderful thing to find help when you need it.  They work all across the valley and come to you.  Amazing!  I could not endorse Mobile Car Dr more enthusiastically than this!   Thank you David and Tristan...may you live long and prosper!"
4,1,"There's something special about a business that comes to your house to do the same  job as  shop/dealer at a fraction of the cost, every aspect of this company  ""amazing""  my car was fixed at the convenience of me sitting in my house watching television relaxing. I strongly recommend you get the dealer out of your life, this is the new way for auto repair, i'm so grateful five stars all the way.. tried to get a second repair can get A mechanic on the phone seven lady wants to schedule an appointment I'm not going to have a new one rack of money I could just drive it to the shop welcome from five star is the one star now"
4,5,"Tristan was very helpful when it came to replacing the oil cooler and ac compressor on my 03 6.0 diesel. reasonably priced and also amazing customer service, I always will bring my vehicles here."
4,5,"Mobile Car Doctor far exceeded my expectations. I've been looking for a specific model truck that stopped being made in 1999. Due to some quirks on features that I'm looking for, and the fact that most of these things were used as workhorses, finding one in decent shape is a challenge, and I've had no luck locally. 

I found a contender in Phoenix, but wanted an independent set of eyes on the truck before I got on a plane with a fistful of cash and a thousand miles of desert that me and my new ride would have to cross before getting home. 

I found Mobile Car Doctor, and am so glad I did. Still haven't decided whether I'll buy this truck, but I'm almost at the point of saying any future remote car shopping (a bad habit of mine) has to be in Phoenix. They got someone out to the dealer the same day I called in. The inspection did not start until about 4:30pm, and lasted a good 2 hours. The technician called me on his way home, and spent a good 25 minutes on the phone walking through his findings. A full written report was promised via email tomorrow morning. Very thorough and detailed (what kind of mechanic tells you about a missing mirror on the passenger side visor and can also 'feel' where in the driveline slippage is occurring???). These guys were great. Put them on the top of your list if you need a pre purchase inspection; my gut says the same methodical detail would go in to actual repair work too."
4,1,I just got a response back from Mobile Car Dr's customer service about the previous review I wrote telling me to check my inbox for a message from them to resolve the issue I have with the service I received and guess what?.... Nothing. I guess they just want to appear to be taking care of the problem. They have my phone number. Why not just call?.... Makes no sense to me.
4,5,"I had just moved back to Arizona from San Antonio, TX when my Chrysler 300C started having issues with my alternator. I am leary of ""shops"" but a friend of mine referred me to the Mobile Car Dr. and I've gotta tell you it's nice to have a Mechanic I can trust to do good work for a reasonable price. My car runs beautifully again. Thank you guys!  I highly recommend your services to anyone!"
4,5,Scott did a great job and was very honest. This is a good company to have when you need a mechanic to come to your house.
4,5,"Called Tristan who returned our call in a timely manner, scheduled an appt where he showed up on time and got to work!! He was very efficient; found the problem and fixed it in a very expeditious manner. He is now our ""go to"" guy!! Highly recommend his services!!!"
4,5,"Normal day getting ready for work and boom...wife's car wouldn't start.  I had her take my car to work, but now i'm stuck.  Knowing little about cars, I knew for sure it was the battery since the lights wouldn't turn on, but even trying to jump it with neighbors cars it failed.  I had a dilemma, get the car tow'd or look for a mobile mechanic....

Luckily I was able to find Tristan and Mobile Car Dr.  He came in about 2hrs and changed the battery.  What was odd was when we started it up, there was a foul burning smell.....it turned out to be a bad alternator as well (mind you we have never changed the alternator on our 10yr old lexus is250).  He offered a great price, and considering it can all be done here at my home while I telecommute.....it was a no brainer.  All in all, the service, communication, and professionalism by Mobile Car Dr was awesome.  I in fact mentioned to Tristan that I will be using their service again for brakes on my car (acura mdx).  Thanks again!!"
4,5,"I have been using Mobile Car Dr. for about 5 years now and these guys have saved me literally thousands of $$.  Scott is the best.  He tells me accurately and honestly what the issue is.  A recent problem was resolved for about $75 in parts instead of $600 at the dealer.  Scott identified the issue correctly that I had misdiagnosed and actually overlooked. If you know how to do simple work yourself and just need a 2nd expert set of eyes to confirm, they give you a straight forward analysis. When the repair is out of your wheel house, they can do everything else. Since they are mobile, its about as convenient as can be."
4,2,"I was looking at buying a car in Phoenix, about 350 miles from me.  I'd done some negotiating with the dealer but needed someone to look at the car in person before I flew in to look at it and presumably buy it.  I contacted Mobile Car Dr.

The cost of a pre-purchase inspection is $120.  That includes no photos and no written report.

After a long list (by phone) of rock chips, door dings, and a bent muffler tip, I actually stopped Scott and said.. ""let me get this straight... you took absolutely no photos?"".  Nope.  Zero photos.

Scott goes on to tell me that he reviewed all the items with the dealer (wait... the dealer?  Aren't you working for me, to get ME negotiation room with the dealer?) before he called me.

This leads to a story of how he used to work for this dealership.  Somehow that didn't come up on the phone when I booked him.  I guess I know why he overlooked so many things.

I arrived the next day to buy my car, the first thing I noticed is that the LCD monitor, the centerpiece of the dashboard, looks like it's been cleaned with a Brillo pad.  There is no way you could sit in this car and not immediately notice it.  We're not talking a tiny scratch, the whole face of the LCD is destroyed.  This somehow did not make it into his report on the condition of the vehicle.

I insert the key, and the first thing this other huge monitor displays is ""Service A1 exceeded by 2000 miles"".  Scott also didn't mention this to me.  

I would not hire Mobile Car Dr to do a pre-purchase inspection of any vehicle, ever."
4,1,Good Sam called this guy and he had no idea what he was doing.  Charged us $190 for NOTHING and said we would need to hire a crane to fix our RV.  He claimed to have a migraine but looked totally hung over!  KOA suggested we call 4-Points RV Service and we're glad we did.  Juan got us a temporary fix and we will be able to continue our trip now and get home.  For $155 he took care of us and we can't thank HIM enough.  I guess the doctor just needed beer money.
4,5,"It's rare that one finds an honest mechanic, in this instance, I've found the Dali lama! I live in the Bahamas and needed a Hybrid 750i BMW inspected in Scottsdale, Az, this is no small purchase as such, I was determined to have the best service from the most knowledgeable professionals possible. Tristan had a mechanic on site in 2 hours, had a fully detailed report the next day, a comprehensive and complete vehicle check of all system WITH pictures of any irregularities or cosmetic issues. I couldn't even see what was being referenced in the HD pics; they were that small. Attention to detail, that's what it's all about. I'm throughly impressed. 

Lastly, I didn't want to give my credit card details and Tristan figured it out through a PayPal request. My interests were protected at all times. Very pleased customer! Sadly, I can't say I buy cars every week, or sight unseen however, if I do again, Tristan and his team will be my go to guys."
5,5,"Adaanced R-V is not just a custom converter of Sprinter vans, while they do not his exceptionally well, they also create an atmosphere of family and friends between owners, management, and staff.

We are always welcome, no question or issue is too small or trivial to receive their full attention. 

The confidence and feeling of security we get from every person about Advanced R-V is amazing.

5,5,"We looked at virtually every coach ""B""  outfitter and choose ARV for their innovation, quality, and customer service.  We are thrilled with our choice and truly believe that they build the best coach in the industry."
3.5,5,"Friendly, courteous staff who explained features of the campground and the general area.  Nice touch that a campground person guides you to your site, disinfects the water hookup, and checks that the water is working. 

Sites are wide, easy access and nicely mowed.  Loved that there is trash AND recycling for campers. Excellent playground with wide area for kids to burn off energy.  Bathrooms were very clean & organized well.  

Only drawback is the proximity to the interstate, there is the constant hum of traffic in the background.  But that is what happens with easy access."
3.5,4,"Showers and laundry are nice. The staff is very helpful and took us to our site. 
Easy to find off the highway. The sites are very close together but nice and flat so there was no problem leveling the coach.  WiFi internet is low speed and I could get better speed with my phone even though I had only one dot. My TiVo couldn't update my program schedule and my MacBookPro couldn't link up to the internet on WiFi. It might have been due to my firewall on my Mac but the TiVo's problem was due to port filtering by the campground. My windows 7 laptop could use the WiFi access. If I was staying longer than one night I'd look into the Mac issues."
3.5,4,"Great KOA- Easy in and out for big rigs. Well tended, nice little pool. One of the best KOAs in the country in my opinion and we have been to many. Convenient to downtown and within walking distance to lots of restaurants."
3.5,2,Ok for 1 night stay. Already read reviews about highway noise. Of course we were put on back row nearest highway facing big commercial building. Couple running it were very friendly. No shade trees & grass needed mowing. Biggest peeve is grass not kept. Sufficient for a nights stay.
3.5,5,"This campground was our saving grace! We came to Madison for an emergency and we arrived pretty late and we still managed to grab a spot very last minute! This campground is pristine!

- The pool / playground area is so cute! The grass is trimmed and not overgrown, the playground equipments seemed to be in good condition.
- There is enough space in each site to open the canopy and have a little picnic on the bench!
- There's even a bonfire pit in each site! 
- The bathroom here is AMAZING! It is very clean and although there's only one in the campground, it's not busy.
- The shower is also great! There's 3 different shower stalls and it was very nice and spacious!"
3,1,"Al's RV place , they are rude no sence  of sale or care, racial , we bought 2  Batteries they died within a year they refused to do anything at all nothing. nasty people they are liars they tell you that if anything at all happens bring it back they'll fix it  or replace it . They did not fix or replace it just nasty people."
3,5,"We have been using Al's RV for years now and they are the best most helpful people I've ever met.  Friendly, professional and yet great personality..  LeeAnn is awesome with lots of good information on the what to's or not to's and if you do that you'll be back to see me..  LOL  You get the straight up with this group.  They will get our business EVERY time.   You can walk in with a part you have half of and not know the name of it and they will walk right over and grab the part.  A lot of knowledge in once place.  You don't get this from the big guys hiring minimum wage kids just to run the shop."
3,5,"The team at Al's RV is amazing! My company uses them for our truck and trailer and they do the best work, and they are fast. Joseph in service will take my call in a heartbeat and he always has an answer when something goes wrong with our rig. They get us in and out every time so quickly - we've never had a problem with work they've done, and we throw them a lot of business. If you're looking for an all encompassing RV repair place - I highly recommend this company."
3,5,"This review is a long time over due.  I've been coming to Al's RV for at least 20 years, ever since the business was called Isley's.  In this period of time I have bought parts, supplies and received service on my RV's.  I always received the very best service with a friendly and helpful staff.  If there is one word I would use to describe how I feel about Al's RV it would be TRUST.  Having 100% trust in any business should say a lot.
My latest experience with them was actually done remotely.  We were traveling in our RV far from Arizona in the heat of the Nevada Great Basin.  Suddenly our frig stopped working putting our trip and all the food in the frig at risk.  I sent Al's RV an email describing my problem and the next morning Al's RV Service Manager (Joseph) called me and through a series of telephone calls and photos via email, he advised me what I could do to resolve the problem.  His solution worked and we were back in on our journey with a working refrigerator.  Al's RV saved the day."
3,5,"Love this place in Glendale. They have what we need, even when I call for help while on a trip, they come through and if it's not in stock or a normal item, they'll order it. Leann is a blast to deal with and very knowledgable with all that has to do with RV's."
3,5,Had a good experience stopping in for an battery charger for my toad. I chose an RVI and so far it's doing the job! Thank you Joseph!
3,1,"I would recommend avoiding any service or repairs on your RV at this facility.  The service/repair department seems to spend more time out back smoking than actually working on your RV.  Workmanship or the quality of repairs they offer for RV's, your better off doing it yourself if you would like to avoid arguing with service manager Joseph on actual quality of workmanship the service department they defiantly lack in this area. 

Stay away if you value your time and your money."
2.5,4,"We love living in Paradise RV Resort!  Yes, there is maintenance to be done as in all resorts.  This is a very friendly, active park.  Many amenities.  I was a snowbird from 2002 until 2012 when we became residents of Arizona.  Suits us to a T!"
2.5,1,"This place is in rough condition, lots are mostly dirt and not raked clean, with ruts in many spots. The majority of snowbird residents are hard to get along with. Age appears to average 75 and joining any activity is tough because of the long time cliches. Lots of old lady gossip and people with nothing to do but cause trouble for rv owners! 
The park is made up of mostly aluminum clad park models that are in need of updating.  If you consider staying here in an rv, ask for a spot near other rv'ers and not park models. By the way, careful driving in here, the majority of residents need to be re-tested for a driver's license!
Don't even consider buying here, bad investment (many for sale)!
The pool has chunks of concrete missing along the top edges. It screams bacteria. The sewer and water systems are in bad shape and constantly being repaired."
2.5,5,"This is a lovely park that is a permanent home to many folks.  The ""park models"" are very well kept, the grounds are neat, clean and well groomed and the RV sites are nicely level with full hook-ups available.
This is also a park that offers a huge variety of activities!  Everything from wood working, to stained glass, to swimming, quilting, painting, and so much more I can't even list it all.  
We stayed twice in April and plan to make this our home base next year for a month during Spring Training."
2.5,1,Made a reservation through Encore Thousand Trails for this resort.  Due to family issues we cannot take the trip.  Called over 30 days in advance to cancel reservation.  We were charged $25. cancelation fee.  we were never told about the cancellation fee when we made the reservation. There are many choices in the Phoenix area and we will use another facility on our next trip.  We do not appreciate a company that will nickle and dime customers to make a buck.
2.5,1,Do not book here if you have a smaller trailer. They will cancel your reservation without so much as an apology. You cannot count on having a place to stay when you book here. Unacceptable business practice.
3,1,"The park itself is very nice, management needs to take sensitivity training.  Thier rude, condescending and unprofessional treatment are causing long-time residents 10yrs ( myself included) to leave.  Many older people are afraid to speak up.  Speak up, get a lawyer, whatever you need to do or this will not change!"
5,5,"My check engine light came on about a week ago and I had the oil changed and transmission flushed at a different garage. The people there were rude and then following that service my car began stalling when I came to a stop. I was directed to H&S by a tire store employee and could not be more grateful!! John and Mark are fantastic mechanics. They truly took care of my car and explained everything to me without treating me like I didn't know anything. If you need any work done on your car go to H&S they are efficient and they will make sure it is done correctly. Thank you again guys, I couldn't be happier with my experience!"
5,5,"Finding a reliable service center to get your car worked on can be a gamble. A gamble that can cost you lots of time, lots of money and a ton of aggravation.  I have to let everyone know that my service center gambling is Finally Over! John and Marc and the whole team at H & S are AWESOME!  I needed new drive shafts replaced in my front wheel  drive Honda Accord since they were clicking on corners all the time. I decided to get away from the high pressure and high prices at the dealership and read some reviews on yelp. When I saw H&S Automotive I remembered that someone had mentioned this place to me almost a year ago. I called and made an appointment to have my car checked by John and Marc. They were so thorough with their inspection and took their time to explain and SHOW ME what the issue was. I was so impressed with their way of doing business that I decided to also get a 4 wheel brake job, oil change and new wipers replaced. I never felt so confident and well taken care of when my car was serviced as I did at H&S Automotive! Want to feel good when you get your car worked on? You will NOT be disappointed at H & S Automotive.  ***** Five stars for service, fairness and quality I will NEVER go anywhere else!"
5,5,"H&S Automotive is a single girls best friend!  John has been taking care of my 2008 Chevy for about 2 years now.  Just recently I was driving home and my check engine light came on and my truck limped home. Onstar towed it to John and here I sit with us both thinking the worst at $2k to fix. After minor surgery, my girl only had a bad valve spring. $300. I also had an exhaust leak, which I knew and needed sparks, wires, clean up the throttle body, oil change, and something else! All fixed for $800 and my truck is running better than when I bought it. 

Thank you John for always taking care of me. Anyone else would have just charged me $2k. John is honest, his labor rates are the least expensive and he will never try to fix things that aren't broken."
5,5,"Just recently moved to Phoenix and was worried about finding an honest, reliable and good mechanic.  I am sure glad I found John and staff at H & S.  I called and talked to John about a noise coming from the back rear tire on a 1999 Jeep Wrangler.  The noise was happening inconsistently and I didn't know what it was.  John got me scheduled in the same day and diagnose the problem quickly and showed me the issue.  It was the brake return spring broke inside the drum.  He made the recommendation and quoted a reasonable price.  John completed the service and delivered the vehicle as agreed.  He even provided transportation back to our home as work was being performed.  Talk about service!! Thanks John!  We are going back to him for oil leak repair on another vehicle we own."
5,5,"John is a stand up mechanic and business owner.
I would recommend his shop and services any day.
His rates are very fair and he maintains a professional attitude. Offer to shuttle me to work at his expense."
3,1,"Changing my rating from 5 stars to 1 star after 8 months of dealing with the warranty/service side of this business. I wish I never bought my Newmar here!!

Calls and emails are not responded to, safety issues are inspected but not corrected and the coach is returned to you time after time with work half done or not done. There has been significant turnover and Desert Autoplex has dropped the ball many times. Communication and follow up has been incredibly poor. 

Newmar lists them as their preferred dealer in Phoenix. We'll be discussing our experiences with Newmar as they need to be aware of how poorly their brand is being represented in this market."
3,5,"I bought a used Class C from DAP RV. Coach Jim worked diligently to get me the price I wanted to pay. The paperwork didn't take forever, and the walk through with Bill was very thorough, and he added a lot of great tips. I felt very confident that I would have few questions. Christina in the parts department quickly set me up with everything I needed. It was a class act from start to finish. I highly recommend Desert Autoplex to anyone looking to buy an RV. I noticed quite a huge selection as well."
3,5,I had the best experience at Desert Autoplex. Everyone was very helpful and welcoming. I highly recommend them for all of your RV needs.
3,1,"If we could give negative stars, we would. Our first encounter was searching for an AirStream travel trailer. Typically, when entering a vehicle lot, one is accosted by sales agents vying for your business. This place is just the opposite. We were serious about buying an AirStream so we pressed through being ignored, not once but twice. The sales agent admitted that he wasn't the expert in this class of trailer, but at least he didn't ignore us. Needless to say, we ended up going elsewhere to find our AirStream. Now, the real review. The LACK of service department. Unfortunately, this place is the only authorized AirStream service location in the Phoenix metropolitan area. We contacted the department (I will avoid using the word 'service' as much as I can) online. This was the only way we could get a response. Even though Jill Morris answered our online request in a rather timely manner, she rejected our calls, which went right to voicemail. The questions we had would have been much better answered in a voice call (both better for her and for us), but she refused. As we, like so many, work busy schedules, we asked if we could drop the unit on a Saturday even though the first drop off appointment wasn't until the following Thursday (for a Friday appointment). We were forced to take time off from work to drop our unit off the following Monday. On the Monday, we were told, by Jill, that there was a good chance that they could get the unit in before Thursday. The following Friday afternoon, I called to get an update on progress. Again, no calls were accepted; only directed to voicemail. The only way we were able to get any response was by email. The email responses were pathetic. The responses were run on sentences with no punctuation, misspellings, and grammar that would insult any first grade teacher. One would think that the sender thought they were texting a close friend in haste rather than a customer from a business address. Totally insulted, we then called the ""service manager"", who, by the way, never followed up with our dissatisfaction on lack of professionalism, lack of communication, or lack of keeping the CUSTOMER informed on the progress of the CUSTOMER's property. Instead, Jill emailed back with a half apology of making us very upset and using the excuse that she never claimed that she had ""good grammar"". Ugh. She claimed that our unit would be diagnosed of problem (not her words) the following Saturday and that we would get a phone call from Rick (the 'service manager'--title used very loosely) with an update. Needless to say, this, too never happened. We never got an update on that Saturday nor on the following Monday. On the following Tuesday, Rick did call saying that the issue was simply ' a ""bad fuse"" that wasn't covered by warranty, that AirStream knew nothing about us, and that we had better get that warranty stuff all worked out.' We find it odd that as an AirStream dealer, that this location would go out of their way to try to worry us about warranty issues when it is typical for transfer of warranty to take up to 45 days by AirStream (we took ownership less than 30 days prior). It is also VERY strange that a simple this ""service"" department now has our unit over a week for something that they claim is just a blown fuse. In asking for clarification of the issue, for cost of the repair, and for time when we can come get our property, now more than 5 phone calls and requests for return calls have been ignored. It would seem that, if this is the AUTHORIZED SEVICE PROVIDER for a particular mechanical product, that they should be: 1) knowledgeable, 2) efficient (the more one works on something, the more one knows it inside and out, the more quickly one is able to fix it, right?), 3) reputable. Maybe we just expect the same degree of professionalism, honesty and standards from others that we do from ourselves.  This has been a pathetic experience. We are awaiting a response from AirStream for an alternative location to take our unit for service. Don't know if Tucson is any better. Can't be any worse. Or can it?"
3,1,"Stopped at Desert Autoplex to browse their Class A motorhomes.  Unfortunately, the same rude sales person was still there.  We ran into this guy last year when we were looking and should have learned our lesson and stayed away.  Last year he told us, without knowing any of our information, we could not afford the coach we were looking at.  This year he told us we were wasting his time and we shouldn't be looking at million dollar coaches if we had $100,000 budget (never discussed any price range).  I guess his mother never taught him not to judge a book by its cover.  My husband told him he was retired from the Air Force and the guy said ""oh, sorry about that"".  Nice thing to say to a veteran.  Will definitely take our business elsewhere and encourage our RV friends to do the same."
3,5,Incredible buying experience from the beginning. Couldn't be happier with our new Fifth Wheel. The whole process was simple and smooth. Highly recommend.
3,5,"I have been in the sales industry for 23 years so I am pretty particular on how I am treated, follow up and just overall customer service. These guys are on point, I started out talking to the owner who I was referred to and then was put in touch with Mike Pratt and was dealt with in a very professional and comforting manner. If you are in the market for anything they have in there inventory do yourself a favor and don't waste your time even stopping anywhere else"
3,5,"Great place to buy a vehicle. I was in the market for a acura mdx 2003-2006 for my wife and was looking locally for a while. The private sellers that were selling them and the small dealers that had some in stock were not very well kept regarding the interior and exterior condition. In addition they were overpriced. I continued looking and found one listed through eBay. From the pictures of this mdx listed by Desert Autoplex was one of the cleanest I'd ever seen. I contacted Eric about the vehicle, who was great to work with,any questions I had he'd answer or he'd get back to me within a couple of hours. He provided records and receipts proving how well maintained this vehicle was. Well I drove 350+ miles from hesperia ca in a rental because the vehicle and price were no doubt worth it. When we arrived there we were greeted with refreshments and were allowed to inspect and drive the vehicle. It was just as described and pictured online. No picture cropping or misinformation. They were a pleasure to do business with and would do business with them again without hesitation. They also sell some brand new nice looking Rv's and streamliners. Thanks again Desert Autoplex."
3,1,"If I could leave no stars I would.  Bought a brand new pop up camper for my little family to make memories, took it out once and found numerous issue from broken drawers to bubbled roofing, called and made an appointment to have issues repaired and was informed no problem we had a full year bumper to bumper warranty and the issues would be fixed in a few weeks, that was on November 6th 2017...fast forward to today February 17th 2018, still no pop up, it sits on their back lot uncovered and no repairs have been made....WTF?they tell me it's a warranty issue, can you feel my frustration?  Bottom line this place gives no effs about the customer, I'm out the money and have no pop up camper, now moving towards legal action.  Take this as a warning future clients, take your business elsewhere unless you have money to throw away.  These are all true and factual statements, it's really a sad state of affairs for me and my family."
3,5,"I did a great deal of research back in May of 2015 over the internet but decided to see what Desert Autoplex could do to compete...what a surprise!  Not only did they compete we had the personal and zero pressure from a very informative Sales and Delivery staff!  CJ and Art were fantastic and came within a few hundred dollars of the best price I could find on my Forest River XLR.  When it came to the delivery, our RV was impeccable and the delivery crew spent all the time needed covering everything.  The reason it took me so long to write this is because I now have a chance to compliment their service.  As for any RV after a few trips you will encounter some issues, the Service Manager Christina, and even the owner Aaron was so accommodating and totally understood each of my squawks (aircraft term) and  ensured everything would be covered.  Class act team of professionals...when I upgrade, Aaron, CJ, Art and the whole team will certainly get a visit from me!!!"
3,1,"If I could rate this a zero, I would...I took my 2015 Ventana there for service (based on Newmars recommendation) in mid may....I just got it back in mid august (just short of three months!)...no one would call me (even after two visits to the store personally where they promised to my face they would call me very week), I had no idea what was going on...I was (finally) told to come to the store to pick up my vehicle (after ten weeks) and when I showed up, the coach was STILL not repaired (repairs noted at the time of checkin in may)...I was (seriously) not happy...my coach finally got back to my place this week (after almost three months)...I would NEVER recommend Desert Autoplex for either service or sales...if they can't fix them, they should not sell them!"
3,1,I was surprised to see all the great reviews on Desert Autoplex RV.  Maybe we visited on an off day but I would never go back.  My husband and I wanted to look at RV's and that seemed to be the problem.  We were looking and not buying.  The sales person was like a vulture and when we said we were only looking he responded very rudely.  If his intention was to have us leave it worked.  We left and will never go back.
3,5,"Mike Hewett is a very responsive and knowledgable salesman. We did not purchase from him because we chose a different used unit elsewhere that fit our needs better, but Mike was the best salesman we came across - someone that would help us be successful quickly."
3,4,"Newmar recommended this dealer for warranty work. Our first experience was great customer service.. After we returned from an extended trip I tried to contact the Service Manager and was very frustrated because I couldn't get him to call me back. I was about to escalate with Newmar when a got a call from the new service manager  who promised to work out the details with Newmar. I placed several calls to check on status and again no return calls. It turns out that both Service managers had departed and Desert Autoplex doesn't disable their voicemail and the operator doesn't tell you that they have departed. This leads to a high level of frustration.

I finally was able to reach Jill who apologized profusely for the communications issues and gave me her direct line.  We made an appointment  and brought our coach in to resolve several issues which because of the all the delays were technically out of warranty. Jill was able to work with Newmar and was able to complete the repairs under warranty in time for our next trip. It took longer than I expected but recognize  Jill had to work through the Newmar processes and parts availability. 

I am very happy with Newmar and Jill will be my ""go to"" person. Great customer service."
3,1,10 hours to service for Sticker decals replaced today (so far we are sitting in the parking lot still). A few weeks ago panels replaced took months to repair. They had  the 5th Wheel almost a whole year replacing things needing repairs and we purchased it 1 year ago brand new. We drove over an hour to get here hoping it would be taken care of in the time they said it would be done. They didn't even have all the parts needed for the repairs. They forgot to lock one of the utility doors so on the way back home that fell off too. Bad experiences over and over again and we came here several times expecting a change . I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you like making payments for something you can't use. They like to blame time and parts on factory. If you need anything shipped takes 3-4 weeks for parts and always ship the wrong parts. Also blamed on factory. Would like them to make the mistakes right and just be honest. If it's going to take longer don't promise the customer that time frame . Desert Autoplex or Forest River we don't know who is to blame for these issues.
3,5,"Having seen several less than great reviews, I am happy to share a very positive  experience. Made an appointment to have a brake control installed and it was done under time and under budget. Tom, the service advisor and Juan who did the install were both Excellent."
3,1,"We purchased a Riverstone Legacy FB from Desert Autoplex  on April 4th 2018. We were to pick it up on April 7th being told it took a minimum or 4 days for the PDI. We paid in full with a trade in of our 5th wheel. Found out they must make their money on financing and selling upgrades such as extended warranties, paint and fabric protector, etc. When we refused to bite on these the attitudes changed which should have been our first red flag.  Also the first day we looked at it with Robert the salesman we noticed the seam covers of the wall boards were not laying flat (very wrinkled). We were assured that they would be fixed during the PDI but were not. During our walk through when we picked it up we were told to get a pad and pen and write down any thing that we found to be a problem. Again mentioned the seams and were told it didn't get passed on....must have been a miscommunication, said with a shrug. Also when we picked it up we had to wait for the cleaning lady to give it the ""white glove""   that was a joke. We took our shoes off to enter and very quickly our white socks were black. Were told it was because so many had walked through it in the parking lot. Well,,, what did the cleaning lady do? We finally left and drove less than a mile to an RV park to stay the night and get to know our new rv a little better.  Tried to sit at the table and found out the table design is a joke(guess that is our fault for not trying to put the leaf in it before we bought it. It is pretty much useless. Though I would try out the washing machine and it wouldn't drain or spin. It wouldn't unlock so sat with wet clothes. The next morning found out the valves for the black tank leaked all over underneath the rv so really hard to believe there was any PDI at all. Took it back to Desert Auto Plex and sat there from 8:30 until 6 pm. Replaced valves(we were told that the ones used were 79 cent plastic so they replaced with brass. Couldn't fix or unlock the washer so finally had to drain with the emergency drain. The list goes on but we left to travel home, 1400 miles, and were told to contact Riverstone with the rest of our problems. It is July and we are still waiting for warranty work,,,many other isuues were discovered on the trip home. We have gotten several form letters from our salesman, stating that we are probably enjoying our new rv and to come back in the future.  Fat chance."
3,1,"While my sales process was fantastic, my services have been anything but. First, my air conditioner failed after two months on a brand new 2017 Airstream. I was told this was a known issue although, as you can imagine, this was not disclosed during sale. After making arrangements to get my Airstream to the dealership, it was a long day of waiting around without any updates. My part arrived hours late. To make matters worse, my service advisor simply left in the middle of the day. He didn't inform me he was leaving and didn't ask any other advisor to add me to their clients for the day. A good 3 1/2 hours after my repair was to be done, it was complete. Since this was under warranty, they thankfully didn't charge me for the part. They did charge me for the labor however with the understanding when the warranty claim paid out in two weeks or so, I would receive a check for the same amount. My Airstream was repaired late October 2016 and it is now late January 2017. NO REIMBURSEMENT. When I called one week ago, I was told my credit card was reimbursed the day before (it's like they knew I was going to call!) but this has turned out to be a blatant lie. There are no refunds complete or pending on my account. This is in addition to calling about issues and promises and promises of phone calls and then their service department simply disappears. I wish there was another option for Airstream service in the Phoenix area, but I am stuck with a dealer and servicer who lies to customers."
3,5,They were fair and honest with me and my wife. Brian helped us find the trailer we were looking for and he was very knowledgeable with the unit. Ask for Brian Knox!
3,1,"I have owned five RVs through the years and dealt with a multitude of dealerships. The absolute worst, by far, is Desert Autoplex in Mesa, Arizona. First off: it takes several days and many phone calls to get someone to answer the phone. You get recorded responses such as: ""No one is available to take your call"" or, ""Hold on while I tried to connect you"" and then you get disconnected. Then when you do get someone, they are usually quite vague about whatever information you are calling for be it service, sales, or administration.
 I bought an RV from them which required some immediate maintenance. I picked it up after they handed me the signoff sheet and I trustingly drove off only to find a day later that some of the work had not been performed.
There are some really nice people there trying to do their job but they seem very shorthanded and very poorly managed. There are many shortcomings, i.e., the telephone service, which could be handled easily if only the owner/manager would take an interest and do something.
Note the BBB has a big REVOKED on its Desert Autoplex site."
3,1,"I recently purchased a new rv from Desert Autoplex and out of all of the new rvs, automobiles and boats that I have purchased new in my lifetime this dealership is the flakiest of all. The sales department was fair at best during the sale but the service department is bottom rung among service departments. They don't do what they say they are going to do, and never follow up. The rv also was not ready when I went to pick it up when it was new and then it now has been 3 months and they still have not completed the items from the original walk through. I would be ashamed to have a service department like theirs."
3,5,"Desert Autoplex turned out to be an awesome place to shop for the finest RV.

In the peak summer heat of Phoenix, we found ourselves shopping to trade our toyhauler and 3500 RAM dually for a 2016 Class A. Most of the dealers we visited left us to wander their yard going in and out of coaches unattended, but when we arrived at Desert Autoplex we met Cory who in 116 degrees showed us through the Newmar product line sharing a vast knowledge of the various models and configurations. 

Cory is a great guy - he knows his product lines backwards and forward and he's all about the customer. He was incredibly helpful throughout our buying experience always ensuring a smooth process. We found his in-depth knowledge of the Newmar product line simply impressive!

Even after the numbers were agreed on and we had met with Joe in Finance (another awesome experience), Cory continued to follow up with us. He texted updates and sent us pics of our new coach as it was being prepped for delivery. Cory was there when we picked up our coach too ensuring that all our expectations were being met. Shawn in Service handled the delivery of our new Dutch Star and he was extremely attentive ensuring that everything was just perfect for us. After a couple of pics in front of the coach with our awesome salesperson Cory, we met with Art to go through delivery and warranty check. Again a very thorough process. 

Before we left with our new Dutch Star we had the opportunity to meet Kevin Miller the owner of the dealership. Kevin clearly understands what customer service is all about and strives to ensure that all of his customers leave happy and satisfied. Kevin and his awesome team make Desert Autoplex one amazing dealership that outpaces and outperforms all the others in town. 

If you are looking for a top notch experience head to Desert Autoplex and ask for Cory!"
3,5,"This rating is specifically for Brian Knox the sales representative we worked with to buy our first Airstream at Desert Autoplex. He was knowledgeable on Airstreams, kind, proficient, and patient as we went back and forth on the price. It took us some time to reach an agreement, but during this time he was very accommodating in making sure we had lunch, etc. Thanks, Brian!"
3,5,"We had been looking for a specific model of hybrid trailer and were able to find it at Desert Autoplex for a very fair price.  We live in California, so we handled everything over the phone pending our visual inspection.  When we came to look at it in person, everything was true to it's representation over the phone and on the internet.  It took us several hours to do the walk through and get a few things fixed before we hit the road, but that is to be expected with buying an RV. Everyone at Desert Autoplex made it a very pleasant experience.  Mike was a great salesperson and made sure we were taken care of through the whole process.  Even recommended a great place to eat lunch while we were waiting for the kitchen faucet to get fixed.  Bill did a great walk through and took care of us as well. It was worth the drive from So Cal."
3,1,"Beware of this place. They low ball the hell out of you on the trade in. Then
jack the price up on the trailer you're interested in. I would not do business with this company."
3,5,"I had a great experience with Desert Autoplex RV when we purchased our used Class A this month.  My sales person Mike Turner spent all day with us and answered all of our questions.  I was very happy with the way we were treated and out transaction in general was pretty flawless.  I would buy from them again and I would absolutely  recommend working with Mike as your sales consultant. He will go out of his way to make sure your happy and returns phone calls quickly, even after the sale. The Service team did a great walk through and made sure we understood our operational systems before we left and said they were ""only a phone call away"" if we needed to be coached through anything (since we are newbies to this RV thing). Super nice crew of people who want to make sure you get taken care of."
3,5,"Thank you Aaron for a great experience! We traded our 33' Jayco trailer for a 2002 40' Monaco Signature. We worked with CJ and he was knowledgable, fair & caring. He obviously loves what he does. The entire transaction was transparent- the usual hassle was non existent. We felt like we got a great deal- a win/win!

We did a punch list & turned the coach over to Eric & Bill in Service. They went way out of their way to get the coach ready for delivery. As Bill put it, he won't deliver a motorhome unless it was ready for his family to drive! We couldn't believe Bill coming out on New Years Eve to fix a problem with our aqua-hot!!!! Thank you Bill! Eric & Bill did a great job and we really appreciate it!

We will & have recommended Desert Autoplex to our friends & acquaintances.

You guys are first class!

Rich & Raylene"
3,5,Incredible buying experience from the beginning couldn't be happier with our new Fifth wheel. The whole process was simple and smooth highly recommended.
3,5,"Back in may, we were looking to upgrade from our pop up tent trailer to for a full sized camp trailer and went to Desert Autoplex RV.  There we met Captain Dean and ended up buying a 17' Coachmen, fully self contained, camp  trailer and have thoroughly enjoyed it on numerous occasions throughout this past summer.  Captain Dean is honest and trustworthy and will treat you right!!!  So, if you are looking to start out, or upgrade your current RV, go to Desert Autoplex RV, and ask for Dean!!!!"
3,1,"They really do know how to insult people! Wanted to possibly trade my boat in if the price was right. Low retail for my boat is 39,000. They just offered me 17.000! Insulting and we were dealing with one then got left with another for the ol bait and switch! I'm happy to keep my boat, thanks!!!"
3,4,"A family member of mine got a motor home from this place. They definitely were polite and helpful (for which I'm very appreciative). They took the time to help them get familiar with the vehicle as well as showed them how everything work. Was a fairly pain-free process. They patiently answered questions, even followup questions. We were very pleased with the service and attention given."
3,5,"I would recommend Mike Pratt and Desert Autoplex to anyone looking to by new toys. They have great customer service and great prices. When I went to pick up my new RZR, they had it detail and it looked brand new. Don't waste your time going anywhere else."
3,5,"If you have a choice, get on a plane, bus, or car and go there right now for anything RV.  Top notch sales staff, service with honesty and integrity.  It's your money, spend it where you will feel good about the transaction!"
3,5,"I recently purchased a 2009 Toyota Prius for my daughter from Desert Autoplex.  I worked with Lorenda and it was a pleasure doing business with her.  Everyone was courteous, friendly and helpful.  There was no pressure and I liked how they let me test drive the car alone without any selling during the drive.  I took it to a Toyota dealer for a pre-purchase inspection and Desert Autoplex took care of a few minor items before the purchase.  They were also very flexible in meeting me at my credit union to make the final transaction.  It was a fair price and my daughter is thrilled with the car!

This is the first time I've made a purchase from an independent car dealer.  I was a little hesitant at first but they made the whole experience easy.  I would definitely do business with them again."
3,1,"This place has the worst customer service I have ever experienced!!! We purchased a boat there a few weeks ago and after taking it out twice on the lake it wouldn't start! We called 10.... Yes 10 times to get it into the shop for repairs! They even hung up on me once! They were ZERO help fixing our boat. We then decided to call Conplete Marine and they were sooo helpful. Helped us diagnose our boat over the phone since they weren't able to get it in that day their shop. We had to pick up our part from CP Marine and the mechanic was also super helpful giving my husband tips on how to change it out. 

Everyone you talk to has a different answer, so be careful what you believe at Desert Autoplex. We were told our boat came with a 1 year warranty that would cover us, well when we were signing paper work that showed to be false. We were also told they would do a complete run,test, and over view of the engine before we took it off the lot to make sure everything was perfect for us..... They didn't! The spark plugs were old and rusted and needed to be changed, the main breaker switch wasn't working it was jammed and needed to be replaced, the battery was about 10 years old and needed to be replaced..... So I would say they did nothing!! My husband also noticed out rear tail light on the trailer was out. When he opened it to check the bulb the entire house for the light fell apart and was rusted... The guys in the shop told us no problem they would order a new one and we could pick up next week... But do you think we can get ahold of them for it??

Take your business else where, this place is a joke!"
3,1,"This company does not deserve any stars....they are the typical used car salesmen. They flat out lied to me on several occasions. I purchased a travel trailer from them they said they perform an 82 point inspection. I got it home to find out it had a broken frame. Two of the fixed door windows slipped out of their frames and there was a one inch gap above them also. They said the repacked the wheel bearings. They took off the dust caps and smeared some new grease on top of the hub nuts. When I took them apart to repack them the grease was filthy and two seals were leaking. There was a problem with the title as well. They promised they would pay for repairs, now they won't answer the phone or emails.
I was a fool to trust them, don't you be one."
3,5,"Desert Autoplex was wonderful to deal with start to finish.  Nancy and Brian were great salespeople.  Brian was very knowledgeable no matter which unit we looked at and they were both extremely patient no-pressure, no-hassle.  Both finance guys Justin and Joe were great, again, no pressure and no hassle.  The delivery man, Shawn was AWESOME.  He did the walk-through with us and repaired everything he could find wrong with the coach before we ever checked it out.  He answered all our questions and even made a couple additional repairs we found during the walk through.   Art was great and helped us out when our salesman or finance guys were off.  This entire experience was absolutely wonderful.   This dealership goes out of their way to be awesome and truly seemed to appreciate our business.   Everyone we encountered thanked us for our business even if they weren't involved in the sale."
3,1,"Buyer Beware of Desert Autoplex
Recently bought a boat from Desert autoplex and the entire experience was appalling. I would never ever recommend anyone buying, selling, or having maintenance done to an RV, boat, or toaster within the confine of this mickey mouse operation. Even the cheapest prostitution joint in Mexico is run better and has better customer service than these A*ss wipes. I am surprised they can even figure out how to install a new water bottle onto of the water cooler!!!! All the positive review on here were left by their own employees. You can go and meet them today!

 When we looked at the boat it appeared to be in good shape. We were told that the craft was recently tested on a local lake and had all oil and fluid changes done to it. It also has a transom saver and original lounge tables that came with the boat.

When we picked up the boat it was missing the tables and transom saver which they said that they would replace. On the trip back to the house the trailer was crashing against the hitch of the truck violently to the point we had to pull over to inspect it. Upon inspection the trailer hydraulic brakes had no fluid in them. Took us 2 extra hours to refill and bleed the 4 brakes on the trailer. Furthermore it's been two months since then and the tables have yet to be seen. I have called many times and never get a response 

First time on the lake that engine had issues idling and then would surge when under load. After taking it in 4 times to be repaired at Desert Autoplex (a ""certified mercury marine engine dealer"") we were told that they had to wait till another shop could fit the boat in for a appointment due to the fact that they did not have the equipment to diagnose the engine. Upon further inspection we found that the oil had not been changed. It took them three weeks to ""fix"" and the day I called I was told that the boat had just arrived from a lake test and was still having issues. I dropped by 5 min after the call and the boat and trailer was completely dry and had not moved from the week before.

Finally after 3 weeks they said the boat was ready and was working fine. After picking up the craft we went to the lake and the surging still persisted. I found that there was an issue with the fuel bulb (that I was told was brand new)  coming off the fuel tank, which I replaced myself. 

There is so so much more to this story(like ripping the rear hatch off when they were trailering it.) but my blood pressure is getting to high just by writing this review. In conclusion if you like to be lied to, cheated, and shafted take your business to Desert Autoplex. If you want a good experience go anywhere else. And for god sakes don't buy a boat from these clowns. 


(P.S.) I am taking 2 hours of my life to post this review to as many sites as possible because of the S*it experience I had there. Hopefully this safes a few people some stress, bottles of men's Rogaine foam, hair transplant treatments, and years off your life due to the stress this place will cause you.

Cheers."
3.5,5,"I was a little Leary when I first looked at consigning our 2017 Heartland Road Warrior 5th wheel. Being that the unit was less than a year old, I knew we would lose money, how much was the big worry. Jack told me what he thought he could net us and I decided that was acceptable and I signed up for 90 days. At about the 2 month mark, I received a call from Jack telling me they had a buyer. From that point Michelle took over and handled the paperwork. If you're needing to sell an RV and you're realistic about what it's worth, I highly recommend RV Consignment Specialists. They delivered for me and I'm sure they can do the same for you."
3.5,5,Very satisfied with RV AZ selling my rig for me. They were courteous and knowledgeable and I received a fair amount from them.
3.5,5,"A Big Thank-you for the fantastic customer service that we received at your dealership after a pleasant sells experience. Upon driving the RV home to Chandler a mechanical issue which was not known to yourself or apparent in the test drive and overall inspection by me during the purchase became apparent. Thank-you for going above and beyond by having this difficult to resolve issue fixed.  The cooperation and the spirit of customer service that was shown is far and above what one would expect in this day and age.  I want all to know that if you are considering a purchase at RV Consignment Specialist in El Mirage, know that you are purchasing from an honest and forthright dealership which truly puts customer service at the top of their list.  With much gratitude, Rawley McC"
3.5,5,I am very  satisfied with RVArizona. I purchased a two year old 5th wheel at a very fair price. The rig was bought over the internet so I only had the pictures to verify the condition.When I picked up the new rig it had been cleaned and detailed and the rig was as advertised on the internet. The process of inspecting the 5th wheel and finishing up the paperwork was painless. Thanks for the great experience
3.5,4,"I wrote a review which reflected a not-so-great experience resulting in a non-purchase, but was then contacted by the General Manager.  He did everything he said he would, and we are going through with the purchase.  He's a very busy guy, but took a lot of time to alleviate our concerns.  We're grateful, especially because the only other place to get these little trailers is in Washington state.  (Northland Model 174).  Update to follow."
3.5,5,These people were awesome. We bought our 5th wheel there and couldn't be happier with the people. Everyone was very nice and on top of everything and fast. Anything we needed got done right away. On top of that their price was untouchable by any other dealer. What else could anyone want.
3.5,1,"Just  UODATE on our last review ,,,,,We got back from our trip accross country .... The DISH  Network Orangewood RV installed was a joke ...We contacted  Dish and meant a service tech  in Fla.. According to  him the bedroom reciever was never hooked up  so it couldn't have been tested like we were told....  Orangewood also installed a harddrive to work as a DVR  and it was to small to work according to Dish.  We took the RV down to have another oil change because i didn't trust  Orangewood  that the did the orig  oil change ....WE have done work with  Orangewood before and they were great but we found out a manager  had moved from the camping world we brought ours from  to  Orange  seems funny to me  the service was terrible at Camping world we stopped going their  now the same  guy is a Orangewood  and their srvice had Dropped like a rock   makes you think  doesn't it ...."
3.5,3,Picked up my rv from Orangewood and the work was very satisfactory just as Brad the operations manager said it would be.
3.5,5,"We just bought a toy hauler from them, First and Foremost Keith the sales guy is amazing. Very nice, and was there to answer any of our concern's and was not PUSHY at ALL like other places. Tony was very kind with us and patient. Josh who works in service, is absolutely wonderful. We have been going to Orange wood RV for awhile an d Josh has not rushed us, he always addressed our concerns. I love that they treat you kindly and that really speaks volumes about how this company in run! Great Job Guys!"
3.5,5,"walked in to get some stuff for what I thought I would need, black and grey water hoses, turns out after talking to Mike I was educated and need something else. Nice guy, great inventory, gonna go back again for when I'm ready to trade in and up."
3.5,5,"If you are in the market for an RV you need to come check out Orangewood RV. We purchased a 2019 Grand Design Reflection 315RLTS. Starting off with Michael Hedricks our sales representative who was in the middle of a family crisis, he was still able to devote 100% of his attention to us and then when he left out of town the General manager Darryl stepped in and had no problem making time for us. Tony the sales director and Chandler in finance was incredible, everyone there treated us with utmost respect. In regards to the sale, nothing was hidden and everything was upfront, nothing but honesty from everyone at Orangewood RV. Gregg who helped us with our walkthrough was extremely knowledgeable and even though we had a million questions he was right there with us the whole way. So if you're looking to get a trailer and you don't come here, you're missing out!"
3.5,2,"Took my rv back to Orangewood RV on Nov. 15th even though I said I wouldn't after the operations manager contacted me and I quote ""he wanted to make things right even if they had to go above and beyond to my satisfaction"" that renewed my confidence. Met with him and we went over items I wasn't ok with and left it there. Waiting to hear from them we'll see what happens. I have a good feeling he was very professional and courteous."
3.5,5,"We just bought a travel trailer (Retro 155XL) from Orangewood RV from Larry. We drove an hour from East Mesa because Larry took the time to answer simple questions over the phone. We went to many RV places in Mesa but no one took the time Larry did. By the end of the sale, I nicknamed him Larry the Legend and my toddlers started calling him Uncle Larry because of how kid friendly he was. He was knowledgable and not pushy. He answered all our questions and we left feeling confident in our purchase. Everyone who worked with us was wonderful. If you are looking for an RV, go see Larry because you won't be sorry!!"
3.5,1,"Never ever buy from this company! Almost 1 year into our purchase and it has been to their shop 4 times with at least over 60 days for promised repairs and when we get it home the repairs are not completed and paying for "" non covered items"" each time! What a joke!!! The worst 80 thousand dollar investment ever made!"
3.5,2,"Took my class b rv in for fiberglass roof repair from storm damage the collision manager Adam assured me I would be completely satisfied and the rv would be detailed after the work was complete after taking it back the second time because there were still cracks in the roof that anyone could see and paint overspray all over except where the major repair was that was the only place cleaned so there was one big shiny spot the rest of the roof covered in dirt with overspray on top I didn't see it until I got home and got up there with a ladder to wax it I immediately called Adam the collision manager and complained about not only not inspecting it for all the damage but why wasn't it cleaned / detailed as promised. There was and still is sticky gue  and grit all over the roof, windows and sides  the manager Adam  got a little short with me the second time I brought it back when I told him I wanted the whole roof cleaned as promised. I will tell everyone that reads this: my insurance company paid just under $10,000 and I paid $500 deductible I was so mad when I picked it up today after it being there approx. a month altogether I asked him what are those big bumps on the roof he told me the tech. Scraped off and filled some old bolt holes with some kind of epoxy or caulking the old filler was nice and level maybe 1/8"" high now they are approx. 1/2"" high it looks sloppy. They applied new decals / pinstriping only on part of the roof and the rest are faded that really looks stupid I had to ask for the rest of the roll of striping which they gave me and I'll have to do it myself. There was also damage inside the bathroom that was repaired and all the caulking is already separating. I asked both times it was there to replace the flush valve in the toilet and it never got done either time. I feel that because I don't  have a big expensive motor home I was treated like a second class citizen I will never go back there
 and will tell anyone that asks not to go there it's the worst repair shop I've ever been to and I've been to many. Hope I didn't put anyone to sleep but this needs to get out.

3.5,2,"We drove into your Surprise location this morning, from Tucson, to view an Impact 351 and a Carbon 347. Both of these trailers are on our ""short list"" and we were excited to find them both on the website under New Inventory. Finding both of them in 1 place was going to make a purchase so much easier. Ed, our salesman, explained that a Carbon was not in the inventory any longer. So disappointed! Not only did Ed not really seem to care, he didn't even suggest seeing if something else in the actual inventory would work for us. So sorry we towed our trade-in all the way there. We won't be back!"
3.5,5,"I purchased a R.V. here and I must say Daniel in service has gone above and beyond when I call for questions or concerns. Its nice when someone is sincerely good at their job and shares it. 
   A good service department is so important when buying an R.V."
3.5,5,"This is one only 1place that I would my RV for any kind of repair work or even body work Adam the Manager in the Collision Dept get a great job for my repairs on my RV he was not happy til I was happy I can't say enough about all the help that Adam gave and if need be they do have 4 spaces to park over night if u have a early morning appointment and free WIFI if u need it, If u call him most times u have to leave a message he will return ur call the same day and will do his best to get u in the same day if it is a serious problem"
3.5,1,"Re: Collision Repair:  Worst customer service ever!  Took our rig in 4 months ago for body repair. Adam said it was an easy job and wouldn't take long.  Well, it took 4 months which is not my complaint.  The communication with customers is non-existent. We had to proactively call every few weeks and leave messages with no call backs. When we did connect with someone, the timeframe for parts to come in would be pushed out.  They should have called us and told us each time this happened, but no, never happened.  I spoke to the owner Mark Tracy and he placated me with the parts problem but my complaint was about the nonexistent communication about delays. Sure made it hard to believe anything they said.  After such inconvenience, I expected some type of concession from Orangewood but, again nothing. Lots of excuses but no responsibility."
3.5,1,Bought a 2016 Montana for 86K June 16th 2016 from Orangewood RV in Surprise AZ.  Had several issues after the first outing.  There were at least 36 items listed that needed to be fixed.  Took the RV back to Orangewood RV in Surprise AZ where we bought it to be fixed on July 2nd 2016.  They had it for over 4 months.  We got it back with some of the same problems and more.  Took the Montana on a trip in Dec and one of the slides leaked in the rain.  On the next service they had it from Jan 2nd to March 10th. Still not fixed.  We took it back to Orangewood in May to do a work order on the items still not fixed. We received a call from the owner of Orangewood RV Mark today he will no longer work with us because we gave a honest review of his business on Google.  Mark the owner of Orangewood telling us to go elsewhere is beyond poor service.  We are making payments on an RV that has been in their shop or on their lot for more time than we have had it.  Doug in service said it's problems with the manufacturer Keystone.   Mark you own Orangewood RV and you sell their products therefore you should service and stand behind the customers who buy from you.  Not tell them to go elsewhere after you take their money.
3.5,1,"This review is for the service (or lack of) area only; made appointment to take our coach in for refrigerator warranty work; I called manufacturer myself to ensure we would get authorization for the needed work before making an appointment at the RV center. Arrived at appointment time, about 15 minutes later Anthony told us it would take 3, maybe up to 5 days to get authorization, parts, and repair, but it would be ready no later than the following Friday (7 total working days). I told Anthony we would pick up on the following Monday, as we would be out of state on Friday, he said perfect, that gave them time to complete the work. On Saturday, a full 10 days of having the coach, and one day after they said it would be ready, Anthony called us to ask AGAIN, the purchase date of the coach so they could relay that to the manufacturer (this tells me they hadn't even called in for the authorization yet). I called twice the following week on Tuesday, left messages for Anthony, told him via voicemail that if the coach was not ready by Friday we would pick it up anyway, he never returned calls; called again on Wednesday and talked to someone (cant remember his name), he asked when did i want to come get the coach, i said Friday, he said: ""morning, afternoon, later?"" I stated around noon. He said he would give Anthony the message to call me back. Anthony called my spouse and said the repairs would be done by 4:30 Friday!!! holy smokes......  I was told by friends not to come here for service, dang, they were right! Will never, ever, take my coach to this establishment again."
3.5,5,"I should have written this review months ago but we have been too busy camping!  Josh the service manger at Orangewood RV was amazing!  After having some issues with our pop up camper we took it to Josh who was able to repair it in days. I called Josh to confirm we were still on to pick up our trailer and he revealed yes, an employee was working through his lunch to pick up a part that was needed.  When going to pick up the trailer it was revealed by the owner of Orangewood that in fact it was Josh who had worked through his lunch to ensure our camper would be ready for our camping trip. This to me proves Orangewood will go above and beyond when able, to create an exceptional customer service experience!  Josh upon pickup also answered questions for at least an hour and popped up unit with us to ensure we were completely confident with the repair.  The entire staff including Darryl store manager,and our sales person Dave were amazing throughout our purchase and we would recommend them to everyone for purchase and repairs!  We will be back in the future and will gladly send in all family and friends.  Thank you all for exceptional service!"
3.5,4,"Took my coach in for an estimate for two bubbles 
On it made an appointment arrived 10 minutes early 20 min after my appointment time a guy comes out takes two pictures gets my email and says he will email the estimate that afternoon or next morning but said Keystone was closed until Monday! I leave call keystone they are in fact open ! Monday 3 days after I was told I would receive it I get the estimate for over 7000
To fix this I was shocked !! Called keystone for the parts they wanted 3000 for and they referred me to another dealer so I went there gentleman comes right out no appointment writes me an estimate on the spot for 1580 to do the same project says two days to repair! It's fixed already 
8 days later ! Not sure what your collision guys issue is but needs to be retrained or something! 
I have two stars just because Billy  whom I buy parts from all the time and Larry sales man are 
Great guys but you did lose a customer"
3.5,1,"Took my class b rv in for fiberglass roof repair from storm damage the collision manager Adam assured me I would be completely satisfied and the rv would be detailed after the work was complete after taking it back the second time because there were still cracks in the roof that anyone could see and paint overspray all over except where the major repair was that was the only place cleaned so there was one big shiny spot the rest of the roof covered in dirt with overspray on top I didn't see it until I got home and got up there with a ladder to wax it I immediately called Adam the collision manager and complained about not only not inspecting it for all the damage but why wasn't it cleaned / detailed as promised. There was and still is sticky gue  and grit all over the roof, windows and sides  the manager Adam  got a little short with me the second time I brought it back when I told him I wanted the whole roof cleaned as promised. I will tell everyone that reads this: my insurance company paid just under $10,000 and I paid $500 deductible I was so mad when I picked it up today after it being there approx. a month altogether I asked him what are those big bumps on the roof he told me the tech. Scraped off and filled some old bolt holes with some kind of epoxy or caulking the old filler was nice and level maybe 1/8"" high now they are approx. 1/2"" high it looks sloppy. They applied new decals / pinstriping only on part of the roof and the rest are faded that really looks stupid I had to ask for the rest of the roll of striping which they gave me and I'll have to do it myself. There was also damage inside the bathroom that was repaired and all the caulking is already separating. I asked both times it was there to replace the flush valve in the toilet and it never got done either time. I feel that because I don't  have a big expensive motor home I was treated like a second class citizen I will never go back there and will tell anyone that asks not to go there it's the worst repair shop I've ever been to and I've been to many. Hope I didn't put anyone to sleep but this needs to get out."
3.5,5,This was a great experience our salesman Michael Hendrix was very professional very customer service orientated everybody here is very friendly I would definitely recommend Orangewood RV Center
3.5,1,"We've had our RV for a year and Orangewood never took care of items they promised to fix. I called numerous times to be ignored. Once you are a customer, service goes from great to terrible! I'll never do business with them again."
3.5,1,"Purchased our Grand Design in Idaho.  We got to AZ for winter and received a letter from GD with a recall on a suspension issue.  We couldn't chance driving it back to ID with this problem so called GD and found that Orangewood AZ was an authorized dealership for their warranty work.  Well, long story short, Orangewood doesn't do the warranty work unless you buy from them without pre-charging your credit card and then charging you for labor and in our case 2 more tires that were ruined.  We spoke with the warranty headman of GD and he told us we should not have been charged a penny.  Orangewood have been paid in full and we haven't received any credit to our card which is over $600.  I wouldn't recommend them for any service work; go somewhere else, dishonest and uncompromising.  Thanks for nothing Anthony!  I'm asking GD for our money back next  and then disputing the charge to my VISA."
3.5,5,"Shane Scott was a delight to work with.  He answered all questions, was very thorough, patient and knowledgable.  
Thanks Shane!"
3.5,5,Great Service! Our service rep Doug stayed in touch with us throughout the warranty work being done on our new Grand Design Momentum! Our first time using service at Orangewood and we will definitely be a return customer!
3.5,1,The only thing that i would get for orange wood RV is propane . This place is not about customer service it about how much can i charge you !! 45.00 dollar to check air pressure . Really !  After haven them do 250.00 dollars of service work that did not need to be done ! ALSO THEY SAID IT WOULD ONLY BE ABOUT A HOUR WHEN IT WAS ALMOST 3 HOUR !! BEWARE OF THESE GUY ! REALLY !!
3.5,5,"hi my name is jack  my wife just purchased a grand design 349m from the boys at orangewood needless to say with a purchase such as this we shopped around  we experienced the good the bad and the ugly. we made it through the bad with just a few scrapes and bruises, experienced  the ugly with a total breakdown in trust and or respect. then orangewood entered our shopping . from the moment I spoke to tony in sales I knew this wood be a different experience and it truly was . the price was spot on the service impeccable, the finance dept was a delite and the owner made time in his busy  day to personally come and thank us and assured us the rest of our journey with orangewood rv would be an excellent experience. Im an old man ,been self employed for some 43 years. I would have been extremely pleased , if my employees would represent  like the orangewood boys do I would not have soooo many wrinkels grate job all around .Tony B ,shane, mark  couldent be happier"
5,5,"I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. Doug was so kind and informational! We are brand new to the RV world- and he has gone out of his way to teach us about the basics of our RV. He helped us hook it up- and let us know if we had any questions we could contact him (which is great because we don't have friends or family out here to help us.) We have had to contact him for questions- and he has always been there for us. He has made us so comfortable with our purchase - I honestly have never met a better, genuine sales person like him. I never write reviews, but wow! He is that good!! I am amazed on his work ethic and willingness to help out his customer. I would recommend anyone to him in a heartbeat! I cannot express my appreciation for all he has done!"
5,5,"My husband and I just purchased our first RV from Tom's in Phoenix. When we first came to look around, they were very patient with us in expaining all the trailers and giving us a tour of everything within our budget. We had a trailer in mind and put a down payment on it that day to hold it until we could come pick it up (yesterday). We worked with Stephen who was very nice and did a great job explaining the process to us and helping us get the best deal we could for the trailer we were purchasing. We signed up for the walk through to make sure everything was working properly and Efran was kind and did all the could to make sure we understood how to set up and how everything worked. He was willing to go beyond what was expected and helped us with a few bumps we had hit while hauling the trailer away! He let us know we could contact them with any questions in the future if we forget how anything works, which was comforting. Lots of knowledge and very customer friendly."
5,5,Very impressed with this place! If interested in buying a camper make sure you swing by here first. Ask for Kyle to help you out because he will go above and beyond to earn your business. I purchased a camper from them Nov 2016 and had an awesome buying experience. I recently had battery issues that required me to return. Kyle and Efran were extremely helpful (give these guys a bonus). They treated me like I was still an important customer. Cant say enough about them or this place. Awesome experience and well worth the 45 min drive!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!
5,5,"I've been a Tom's Camperland customer for a long time. They have always had excellent customer service and excellent products.  I had an issue with ARE on a camper I recently bought and even though ARE didn't feel the need to address the issue in a timely manner, Tom's did and they took care of everything.  I would never buy a shell or bed cover from anyone else."
5,5,"We recently purchased a used 2015 Keystone Bullet from Tom's and were impressed with their professionalism. Kyle in particular was very helpful and knowledgable. After purchasing this used trailer they went above and beyond in the delivery of the trailer to make sure that everything was in good working order and to our satisfaction. They also included a 30 day warranty which was helpful as we were able to get it out on a short 3 day road trip to try and ""break"" stuff. There were a couple of items that needed to be addressed which they did. Efran in their service department was instrumental in making sure that everything went smoothly. These guys know how to treat customers."
5,5,"Kent and Doug are the faces of this place and I couldn't be happier with their service. They're great to work with, informative, and professional. I am traveling across the country with my travel trailer and had to get it checked out at an authorized dealer which was tough to coordinate but once I found this place, Kent went above and beyond to help me before my warranty was up. It turned out not to be anything serious and a pretty simple fix. This place is on their game and reasonably priced. I definitely recommend this place. Their staff is what makes the difference."
5,5,"We had a great experience from the first phone call, to sale, to maintenance. Doug, Kyle and Efrin we're very informative and helpful. We were kept in communication and treated very well. I would highly recommend them if you want to purchase any RV, we will be recommending them to all our friends and family as we fully trust they prove great customer service. We traded in on a new 2018 unit and it was extremely painless, quick and the best sales experience I have had when purchasing anything."
5,5,"Paul and the guys will do an outstanding job. Anything from RV's to rigs to cars and trucks. Always prompt, friendly and top quality work."
5,5,"After going back to this establishment I was refunded my money , just to give it back . This visit was much more professional than the last one ,and more rewarding. After Matt was done load balancing the tires he explained how the machine worked and what it did to achieve this. With out a doubt 200% better going down the road and completely satisfied with the service there."
5,5,Great customer service they have a wealth of knowledge about tires honest did not sell me anything that I did not need. I  purchased  the tire monitoring kit works great for my toy hauler also he showed me the difference in tires
5,5,Paul and his crew did a fantastic job going above and beyond with 6 new tires on our motorhome.  It turns out the wheels were not standard wheels for a Workhorse Chassis and they logged many hours doing their best to give us the best ride.  I would highly recommend them to anyone with an rv.  Paul has 30 years experience and they specialize in recreational vehicles.  We are very grateful to them and will never go anywhere else.  They are simply the most knowledgeable and caring service center we have ever worked with.
5,5,"Fast service, great prices, friendly, 5 star experience all the way.  If you need tires you really need to call and get a price quote.  Family owned and operated, you feel like you are buying something from a relative.  They had my tires and got me in and out in under 30 minutes."
5,5,Just bought a set of tires for my Monaco RV. Firebird tire was great communicating with me in getting the quotes and when I showed up they were on time. They did a great job installing the tires. After learning about the investment they have made to balance RV and Truck tires I won't go anywhere but here. Highly recommend Firebird tire.
5,5,"We have a sprinter van and need to have valve extensions put on because it was impossible to fill the dual tires without them.  We called everywhere - RV dealer, tire stores, auto repair shops and they either didn't do this type of work or they wanted to install cheap rubber extensions.  Finally, we found Firebird Tire on line.  They replaced our original tire stems with elongated curved metal stems that reached to the outside tires, and the cost was a third less than we were quoted by an RV dealer for cheap rubber extensions.  Service was outstanding and they had it done when they said they would!"
3.5,5,"Me and my little dogs had no idea where we would stay in Phoenix Arizona last month. Destiny was the answer. One of my favorite things about the location was the proximity to such beautiful stores and shopping anything that I would need was within five minutes from the park from target, the post office, you name it. A couple of friends had told me that there was a nice park on the west side of the valley by the name of the destiny RV resort, and that may have been a big understatement on there part. As I would call the place nothing less than just The BEST! My pets and I both very much enjoyed our stay to say the least. We loved the new dog run with the synthetic turf, shady trees and bench for me to sit and relax while the pups played. The park was very clean and the staff was exceptionally professional. I will definitely be back in the fall and can't wait to enjoy some more of these great community activities that I was a part of during my next stay. See yall soon!"
3.5,4,"We came to AZ for Dodgers spring training and this time we wanted to bring our rig.  We picked this park because theres no age restriction (many are 55+) and it was only 12 miles from Camelback (about a 20 min drive).  I must say first impression I wasn't that impressed.  The place looks outdated and although it's not a retirement park it kinda feels like one.  There is nothing around it so anything that you need you will have to drive.  During our 4 day stay we only ran into one other family with kids. Everyone else was older, but to be fair everyone was very friendly & the park was very clean. We didn't use any other amenities besides the pool and that was fine.  We had a deluxe site which was pretty plain, just hookups and a picnic table. We were dissapointed that there was no fire pit though, so no smores on this trip.  I did notice the pull through sites had a bbq grill (like the ones in parks) so maybe next time we will get one of those that way we can cook outside.  The air force base is near by so you will get some noise from there, it was annoying at first but then we tuned it out.  For the most part we spent our days either at baseball games or trying to get autographs, so we just came here to sleep.  For that this was fine.  Considering the cost of my 4 nights here was the equivalent of one night at a hotel I would definitely stay here again."
3.5,5,"Our new favorite spot in Arizona!!!!  Property is in excellent condition.  Staff is welcoming and ABSOLUTELY amazingly helpful.  We just love Woody, he litetally saved our vacation!!!!  THANK YOU!!!!!!  Property is close to town without being in town or feeling in any way crammed.  Also, close to the I-10, really convenient."
3.5,5,Fantastic gym  wow  biggest fitness center I've ever seen  it has everything  pool is huge and clean   Bathrooms are very clean   I can't wait to come back and it's going to be very soon    People are so friendly
3.5,4,"Great stop. Hot hot Hot! No shade to be found and no grass. Just aisle after aisle of rock. Thankfully the pool was cool and refreshing! Randall, the security guy was welcoming and helpful. Found it strange that the park store closed at 3pm on Saturday and closed all day Sunday. Isn't that when people vacation in an RV? Great little stop for a night. Very clean and felt secure. My dogs enjoyed the fenced dog run."
3.5,1,"DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR; DO NOT STAY HERE. This RV resort is a trailer park full of drama. The Owners of this place are couple of cheap con artists. Paying the employees terrible wages and often harassing them. Even the managers ""Kat and Mark"" are terrible people. Kat and Mark are very Rude to the poor people living here. I've seen Mark on multiple occasions scream at the elderly while I'm the office as they are paying their rent for the month. You do not want to be harassed by Management here it's awful and a disgrace to the wonderful people trying to live peacefully. Do not stay here the management is terrible. I am hooking up to my airstream and leaving immediately!!!"
3.5,5,"Just wanted to let everyone know what my Granddaughter said this morning while walking to the bus stop 
This is a dream come true living here I just love it Grandma I have so much fun here and everyone is super nice Awww I'm so glad  
Grandpa &  I   Agree 
A super place to call home"
3.5,5,"We went to AZ unfortunately so I could go to the Mayo Clinic, not for a fun vacation. This was during their high season and they were booked solid. I called and told them my situation and the women that run this place are the most thoughtful caring group that you could hope to meet. They went out of their way to accommodate us during a very stressful time, they worked their magic and moved us to the top of the list for a spot and I can't thank them enough. God worked his magic to get us in, there were NO spots anywhere in town everyone was booked solid. Sometimes you run into people in your life that truly care about people. 

Thank you to the entire staff at Destiny RV Resort, we hope to return next year for some fun and not 7 weeks of Doctor appointment. 

Anita G."
3.5,5,"We love this rv park!! We drove all the way from Alaska, and stayed at a lot of rv parks, but this was the best! 
Very friendly staff! Very clean! Nice big sites with patios & picnic tables at every site and most have trees, so you have some shade from the hot sun! And we also like that it's close to just about everything you need in restaurants, groceries, shopping, etc!
We will definitely stay here again!
Gary & Wendy DiCaprio"
3.5,3,"This place is a little hidden gem!  We love the security.  The front office - Tammy and crew are awesome!!!  It definitely fills up during high season so make your reservations.  They are pet friendly.  We never used any of the facilities but saw people who did and they looked happy.  Our satélite didn't work but the cable they offer did the trick.  Sites are small with minimal privacy.  The location is good.  Goodyear is close to Phoenix, Scottsdale etc."
3.5,4,"Marc and Kat his wife since taking over the management team has done a great job keeping the area clean and safe 
Work out room is always perfect and the all around rv park is quite and freindly
Kat makes everyone happy with her cheerful personality 
Marc has the office organized  and his employees making customers happy 
Pool is big but needs to be chlorinated more as it stays cloudy and could use the water filters circulating water better 
Pool boy would be a good idea to keep better attention 
Hot tub sometimes works sometimes down for repair iffy but mostly clean 
5 if the pool conditions are little better 
Washrooms/laundry always clean and good working order 
My stay is always pleasant and will return soon"
3.5,4,"We ended up staying in Phoenix due to a medical emergency on our way to Sedona.  The folks at Destiny were professional, friendly and accommodating with our last minute reservation.  The park is extremely clean and well maintained.  Loved how someone obviously has pride in the park with all of the Halloween detail out front.  We actually would stay here again in a heartbeat for a quick stay away.  It isn't in a scenic area, but would highly recommend."
3.5,1,"We have been coming here for more than a decade. It used to be family friendly, our kids learned to ride bikes and swim all right here, great memories! Now the new ownership has created a park with a bunch of grumpy old blue hairs! No wonder there is a generational gap with today's youth. Don't stay here unless you are the grinch or related to him! Their price has doubled in the last year as well."
3.5,5,"I've been traveling for work since 2009 and this is one of my favorite parks I have stayed in, I liked it so well that I've made this my permanent home for over 7 years now the staff is wonderful great friends come and go yearly all of the facilities are kept up and clean and they have wonderful events all through the year"
3.5,1,"I really wish I could give this place zero stars because it truly is a big fat zero in my book. If you like to surround yourself with ppl who are judgemental and discriminate then this is the perfect place for you. They do background checks which I think is a great thing to keep the riff raff out. But they told me and my husband that we couldn't stay there based solely on my husbands appearance. We offered to pay for a background check and everything and the manager said no. He didn't want us there because he had a ""gut feeling"" lol. So beware.....if you don't look just so then you'll be discrimated against just because of this mans ""gut feeling"" so with no background check or any logical reasoning we were basically homeless and had to spend our money on staying in hotels until we found other arrangements. Traveling over a thousand miles to be treated this way was very upsetting. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone because I don't judge ppl on their looks I actually get to know them before I come to my decision."
5,5,I have been a customer since 2000. Was able to purchase a quality used vehicle at a competitive price. Service is first rate and exceeds expectations. Worth a trip if you are interested in purchasing a quality golf car.
5,5,"I never realized how naive I was about golf cars and the maintenance involved. I am trying to get the one I purchased up and running to sell and called the service dept. at South East. I spoke to Dave who, despite the fact that the call would most likely not result in an immediate sale, happily shared his expertise with me to help me with troubleshooting battery issues. Thank you, Dave! Great customer service is getting harder and harder to come by and I will certainly recommend South East to anyone looking for a golf car or accessories."
5,5,South East is a great place for all your golf car needs. You will be treated with respect they are the best in the business! James is very knowledgeable employee @ south east! If you have any problems with your golf car he is there to help! James treated me like I was family. Thank you to the great staff at south east will be a customer for life! P.S. they are a Club Car dealer if you want the best go with club car not the other guys! 5 stars all the way! VERY HAPPY!
2.5,1,"watch out for this guy he's a very evil man I need a new head gasket a year ago he came over different each time no license plate on his car I should have known took him about 3 weeks to fix my head gasket he ended up charging me more than what he said at the beginning well to make a long story short a year later I have water in my spark plugs I need a new head gasket again I paid this guy $1,000 and now I have to do it all over again I have a 3 year warranty on the labor he said he was going to come over and check it out last week he never showed up he never answers my calls never answered my text.. so here I am stuck with a broke down vehicle that I spent $1,000 on a year ago I'm taking this evil man and I'm going to do everything in my power to make him pay for me and everybody else He has screwed in the last couple years... if I just would have went to a mechanic shop I would still have my truck now I'm going to have to sell my truck this guy needs all his karma to come back and bite him in the ass.... do not have this guy work on your vehicle you will be sorry and broke and probably have to sell your vehicle...don't trust him... I'm a single mother and he messed my truck after I spent $1,000 on it and now I have no vehicle"
2.5,1,"I'd rather give him no star, but he did show up a few times and get work done, even if it was on his own schedule. Long story short as possible, he saw the money and a way to make it. We had no idea what was wrong with the car, he fed us a bull list and we paid EVERYTIME he came up with something new. A 1600 repair that was to be completed in 4 days took 10 and over 2k, and guess what it's currently sitting at another shop getting fixed from what he charged us for!! Definitely not the stand up guy he promotes himself to be. And I must note that when we finally were on to him, we refused that last repair for crap parts and price but after threatening my sister, single mom of 4 we decided to pay the idiot so he would stop. He literally texted us over 100 times. Desperate for money=bad judgment and workmanship. He missed the most important part of the job. So now he can deal with our credit card dispute, have fun you seem to like to entertain yourself. Do Not use him and if you did I hope you did not pay cash...also his warranty is a line of crap, after we took the car else where and send him the 1500 repair for his mistakes, he took three days to tell us..not covered.  He is the worse"
2.5,1,"Kevin Allard:  Allard Automotive Industries:  Mobile Mechanic

RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!

DO NOT CALL:  DO NOT HIRE:  Especially DO NOT GIVE HIM CASH

After contacting Mr. Allard on the phone and describing our cars symptoms, we set an appointment for the following morning at 10am for him to come to our home to look at the issue.   The next morning he didn't show up, but called about 20 minutes after the appointed time to say he was running late, which is understandable.  So he said he would be there at noon.  At noon he was a no show, I ended up calling him at 1pm to find out if he was still coming or not, he replied that he was on his way and would be there at 2pm.  Again come 2:30 and still no show, so after calling him again he said he was just down the road with another excuse as to why he was running late.  Finally he shows up at 4pm.  He looked over the car, briefly, and came to the same outcome I had already told him what the problem was.  Mr. Allard indicated that he needed to procure the parts for the service repair, but only took cash because his debit card reader was broken.  So, I gave him cash (Over $400)(Big Mistake) for the parts with an invoice showing I gave him cash to buy the necessary parts.  We then set an appointment for the following morning at 8am to get the repairs completed.   

Come the following morning and no show for the 8am appointed time,  I called him at 9am to find out when he was actually going to be to our house for the repairs.  He made another excuse and said he will be at our house at 10am.  It's now 11am, 3 hours past the appointment time, and he still hasn't showed up nor even bothered to call as to when he will be present for the repairs.  I called him again just hear another excuse and that he was on his way to his supplier to buy the parts and that he would be here between 12 & 12:30pm.  As anyone would expect, he was still a no show, so I called him once again where he said that his supplier no longer has our parts, that he would have to order them and wouldn't be till later on in the week.  I then cancelled in frustration of being put off by his lack of service and responsibility, but was full of excuses, he then hung up on me.  I called him back a few minutes later I asked for my money to be returned knowing that he obviously hadn't bought any parts with it yet, he then hung up on me again.  He no longer would accept the calls from my phone.  So, after calling him back from another number he refused to refund my cash and said that he would order the parts and have them shipped to me and then hung up on me again.  He indicated per his policy, shipping is the only delivery method for the parts, which was fine as I either want my money back or the parts that I paid for.  Later that night he sent me a tracking number through UPS, which can be created by anyone with an account and he said the parts would ship on a certain day.  Low and behold, of course, nothing ships on even the week that he promised.  He is now not answering any calls from any of my numbers, not responding to text messages, and not responding to emails.  The parts have yet to be shipped and I can't get a hold of him no matter what.  

Upon further research we found that we aren't the only people he has done this too.  We found he has multiple complaints on the Better Business Bureau against him, along with similar customer reviews, that he also has some complaints on the website RipOffReport.com."
2.5,5,"Kevin came to my home yesterday by appointment to replace the sagging headliner in my Plymouth Grand Voyager minivan. I found his company off Craigslist and the internet.  He was very helpful in assisting me to pick out the new headliner color with his board of color patches.  Working alone it took him about 4 hours (as he had predicted) to remove the old headliner board, clean the old foam off, and then install the newly covered headliner back into the van.  His cleanup afterward was immaculate.  He was very friendly and polite.  Most importantly his work porduct and price were both excellent and the work has a lifetime guarantee  (mine I assume since I am much older than him).  I recommend Kevin without reservation for this type of work.  I have yet to utilize his other services but surely will in the future.
Don S."
2.5,4,I give this a 4.5 star rating!!  The mobile ready Kevin was awesome!!!  My only criticism would be he needs more help!!!!!  He is right now a one man band.   He knew his stuff and was able to diagnose and repair.  We had already  received 2 opinions on the problem with our car.  He also without knowing the others opinions knew what was wrong.   He repaired our car at a budget friendly price.  He was well worth the money.  Give him a call and show support for the independent business owner! !!
2.5,5,"Very Satisfied!! He arrived when he said he was coming, took a look at job, assessed cost to fix, had me look over the estimate and then proceeded to do exactly what he committed to do and at the price he quoted. He was courteous and knows what he is doing. I would recommend Allard for your next repair. I will be calling on his service again."
2.5,1,"Kevin Allard is a evil and dishonest man and he makes mechanics everywhere look bad. It's people like him that give the automotive industry a dishonorable taste. He took my money and did about 70% of the job, and on top of that he waited about a month to finally ""cancel his services"". I paid him to do 2 jobs. A head gasket and a cv joint and bearing. I made the unfortunate mistake of paying for this service before it was done. I am from a small honest town and was not use to deception. I since then have learned the error of my thoughts. When I paid him in advanced and as soon as that was done. His effort he put into the job went down the drain! It was going well at first, the job was going well and it was going fast but he asked for another payment and i gave it to him but right after I did that he stopped coming in to work on it. he only came back in for a couple more hours then he stopped. 

     The ""job"" lasted 24 days then he texted me saying that I removed parts from the vehicle!?  He said that I ""harassed him"" I would like to see these harassing texts he said he received. No matter what Happened he should have called me and used his voice to tell me this. Just a text and a email then he blocked me. When you block somebody like that, it shows that you know what your doing was wrong.

     He still didn't do the 2nd job. He said that he was not going to finish the job and that he will send me the parts!! he still has not done that, it has been months since he said that and he has blocked my email and my phone. He told me that his reviews where his competition, I know that it is a lie now and they are most likely true. I am putting this warning out here for anybody needing repairs. Just go to a shop with real mechanics and pay a little more for a honest person. 

Update 
It has been months since this ordeal has taken place and I have gotten nothing from him besides a random text asking for my address? I responded and got nothing from him. Another thing I will add, he did not even do part of the 70% of the job that he did do right. I just had the heater return pipe blow out of the intake manifold coolant crossover. Looking at it he did not install it fully. Now there was coolant shot all over the place. Now it looks like if I want my money back I will have to fight for it in the courthouse. I lost too much to let it lie."
2.5,1,"I hired this guy to do a diag on my 93 Chevy 4x4. I was not getting fuel to the injectors. After showing up later then he said, he proceeded to check the truck. After a while he said that is was the EMC that checked out bad. At this point he pointed to the black box under the hood ( which I found out later was the ABS module). I went to the junk yard and pick up a new computer and came back an installed it.  The truck still would not run. I called Kevin to come back out and see what the issue it as he said he check everything and that he guaranteed that the computer was the issue. He was to return on 8/26 at 4pm which was the next time he had an appt. I called earlier in the day to confirm the appt with no answer. 4pm came and went I called him like 8 more times though out the night still not answer I sent text messages and left VMs. I have continued this thought out Thursday with no answer. So I am out the $50 diag fee no closer to figuring out what the issue is and now have to pay another shop to look at it. I am not happy with the respect or Kevin for the way this situation has been handled."

----------
Hi Joe,

I expected to receive a call from you by now regarding the issues we had with our rental that frankly made our trip miserable (Freedom Express, 11/20-22).

We had two major issues, which are both documented on our checkout form and from my understanding, reported to you by Larry and another female employee as well:

1. Carbon Monoxide Detector - The detector went off every 15 minutes even when the generator was not on and oddly/inconveniently only in the middle of the night. As you know, these alarms are very loud by design so we were not able to sleep at all as we had to get up every 15 minutes to press the reset button (which seemed to turn it off after 15 seconds when pressed bu​t not stay off for the night). We checked the detector and it said it should be replaced in 2005, meaning it is TEN YEARS passed scheduled replacement - that is extremely inconvenient (when it malfunctions and goes off unnecessarily) and unsafe (should there actually be toxic levels of carbon monoxide). Under normal circumstances, this would be a major issue; however, I am pregnant so the lack of sleep caused by the defective monitor (not to mention the extra anxiety at the unsafe conditions) made for miserable nights and long days. We were unable to book any hotel room in the area as it was VT's coach's last home game and sold out for months - though we would have paid the exorbitant costs to get a good night's sleep.

2. Oven - The pilot light was broken and therefore the oven would not work. We looked up YouTube videos of this oven model to troubleshoot on our own and finally called Larry for help who was very nice and genuine in wanting to help us but ultimately was not able to. This ruined our tailgate as all of the food I was preparing was unable to be cooked (neither stovetop nor microwave would have worked as these things had to be baked). One of the primary reasons we planned this RV trip was to have the RV tailgate experience; however, we had to completely change our plans and go downtown to eat/tailgate - a HUGE disappointment and on top of no sleep, the epitome of adding insult to injury. We also had to throw away a lot of unused food as we could not take it back with us on our flight.

Additionally, the name ""Luxury RVs"" is a complete misnomer as I'm confident the RV had never been properly cleaned. The bathroom was the most disgusting facility I've seen - including port-a-pots: there were human feces left in the toilet, urine stains on the toilet and floor, hairs everywhere, and grime all over the sink. I spent two hours not only scrubbing the bathroom but wiping down every surface of the RV (and storing the comforter which was covered in gross stains). I'm sure it was in the best condition it's been in in a long time when we returned it.

Overall, our experience was horrible. Your employees were very nice, including the guy (I forget his name) who met us Sunday morning for checkout; however, your lack of response to our issues is really disappointing and just plain unprofessional - especially after Larry assured me two times and the other lady I spoke with promised as well that you would call when you got back to the office to talk to me about these issues and see what you could do to compensate us (his words).

I waited until after Thanksgiving figuring that you would be busy with the holiday and/or taking time off, but it's been almost two weeks; I'd like a response."
3,5,We have never driven or ever been in an RV till we rented one from Joe and his team. There were 2 families and it was smooth sailing from booking the reservation to picking the RV up and them explaining what every was and did.  We even had an issue trying to get the TV to work when we got to our destination and we called and they fixed it over the phone with us. Incredible customer service and the next time we have to rent from Joe we definitely will only rent from them. Even the drop off was veryyyyyy easy and quick. Thanks guys for making our trip so awesome.
3,5,"My wife and I and two other couples rented the Sprinter RV from Luxury RV rentals for a 9 day trip and we could not have been more satisfied with all aspects of the experience for the following reasons:

1. Sprinter RV is a great choice to meet our needs as a cruising vehicle

2. Garrett did a very thorough walk thru and training session before our departure

3. Larry and Joe where professional and reasonable during the rental negotiations

4. When we had some minor operational issues during our trip, they all offered solutions in a timely manner

5. We would not hesitate to rent from Luxury RV Rentals in the future with the confidence of being treated in a personal and professional manner.

On behalf of my wife and our friends, thank you for making it a memorable trip.

Best regards,

Mark and Nancy K."

My wife and I with our children and grandchildren, rented an RV from the above company from 7/282016 to 8/1/2016.  We paid $1,746 plus insurance $170, for the 4 day rental.  Upon picking up the vehicle it was noted that we would need a step stool to get up into the large RV since the steps were broken and tied up underneath.  Once on our trip, we turned on the water pump to use the water and the toilet only to discover the floor flooded.  We noticed someone had tried to bandage the leak and put a small bucket behind the toilet.  Consequently we turned the pump off and were unable to use any water.  In addition, the RV was obviously not cleaned with garbage in the sink, the fridge and freezer kept flying open hitting my wife in the head.  But the worst and most dangerous was inoperable windshield wipers in a rain storm across 4 states at night, causing us to pull over until it stopped raining, turning an 11 hour trip into almost 18 hours.  
Once at our destination we could not sleep in the RV without the use of water and had to rent a hotel room for 2 nights at a cost $358.  I contacted the company and was told they could not authorize any repairs and would repair the RV when we return.
On 8/1/2016, the manager of the RV rental said that he would contact the owner and get back to us.  When he did not call us, I called back on 8/5/2016 and was told the owner would not reimburse us and gave us his phone number.  At a minimum we would like to be reimbursed for the hotel room and an apology from the owner who has not returned our call that we made on 8/5/2016 and left a detailed message.
Filed this complaint with the Charlotte BBB and the owner has not responded to the BBB to date."
1,1,"Where do I start....my customers experience has been the worst. I had to demand for things to get done to my vehicle or I wasn't going to sign paper work for the second time. Patrick was my sale person and is the worest. I spent three hours waiting for my car to get fix and decal. He never offered me anything to drink or kept me updated. The staff is not friendly expect for a gentleman who was in charge of maintenance  (Super nice). I expressed my concerns about  having to bring my vehicle back to get fix, sign paperwork twice and pay 140 for a key fod was an inconvenience to me Patrick could care less. This dealership has alot to learn about making  
their customers feel number 1. Patrick is full of broken promises until he is confronted. Dont waste your time, hard earn money, or energy on this place.  Not worth it, spend your hard earn money where you can feel appreciated."
1,1,"This is lady P P, again today when I got home and check my mail. I have three (3) documents letter from the car lot, car insurance. I NEVER DROVE OFF THE CAR LOT WITH A CAR!....( AND I HAVE CAR INSURANCE?!?! FOR THIS CAR I NEVER GOT)!

1,1,"WORST DEALER SHIP EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD.  I have decided to write this review even though we are still dealing with this finance manger for what other fathomable reason I can not understand other than that my fiance knows that I absolutely fell in love with this RV.We have been wanting an RV and happen to be driving by this lot when we saw this fith wheel rv. My fiance had been working on his credit & had finally broke a score of 700 so he thought why not look now? We noticed the huge sign on window that said EVERYONE APPROVED & though well hell we should definitely qualify with his score & at a decent interest rate. He asked the dealer his questions & they convinced us to fill out a prequalification form they said would not show up as an inquiry (that part was a lie). They said we should definitely qualify & gave us a list of things we would need. we peered at the offer & it looked outrageous! The price of the RV was 13,663 They wanted $3500 down & were gonna stick us at an interest rate of 24%! our payments were gonna be at $450 a month! We said no way we can get a way better deal than that somewhere else. They asked what we were able to do & we told them we didnt want an interest rate higher than 15% They said ok lets see what we can do. The finance guy comes back & says ok we got a deal & that we were approved for what we asked for. The only things we didnt have at the moment were his paystubs and proof of insurance (what we needed to take delivery of the rv). Since it was the weekend we agreed to come back on monday. We came back filled out our ""supposedly approval contract & paperwork"" & as soon as he filled this out was told loan was not approved & still pending approval. We also noticed that what was in contract was changed from the term agreement we were told was different  had extended the term longer. We both stepped outside for a couple minutes to discuss it over & made decicision that ok we will take longer term payments. We also decided not to take possesion of RV until we were absolutely sure loan was approved & still not ""pending approval"" (thank goodness we did this because I would few days later discover a story and other stories of people taking a vehicle off the lot thinking they were approved but indeed were not only to have to bring the vehicle back 2 weeks later.And with his income and credit rating we would have been easily convinced that there was no way we would not have been approved). We come back monday and come to agreement that we will put $1000 down and a promise to pay from my debit card in the amount of $500. I sign the promise to pay form but my fiance says he will not put the $1000 down until it comes time for delivery and is absolutely sure we have been approved because they still need his paycheck stubs that he agrees he will email them as soon as we get home. They say ok , we fill out paper work then he goes home and emails them his paycheck stubs. they tell him they stubs dont have a year to date on them so he gets in touch with his boss who sends him his year to date income information (my fiance has been with this employer for 2 years, gets a paycheck every week and makes plenty enough to more than afford this payment not to mention his credit rating was not bad). They call back and ask him if they can put me on the loan as well. My fiance asks why and they do not give him any explanation. So they agree to proceed ahead. We still have not heard if we have been approved or denied. Its is approaching 3 weeks & getting closer to that promise to pay time. Everytime we call the dealership they either avoid us or tell us the finance manager is not there. Recently they told us he will be here tomorrow only to arrive & he be suddenly not there for the day. I feel like they are avoiding us. I just want this to end. I told my fiance tell them deal is off I dont want this anymore but everytime he texts finance manager saying this he says Im waiting to hear back from bank im finalizing the paperwork I'll contact you tomorrow but he never does.Either this finance manager is terrible at his job or I am desperately being conned. Approved or denied, I just want this to be over!"
1,1,"Watch out for these guys!

I purchased a vehicle from them in 2013 when they were at their old location at 2020 E Bell Rd.  And under another name, Dulara Auto Sales and Big Bell Road Auto or something similar. (Nice try Aslam D. you were the owner at the other location as well.  These are EXACTLY THE SAME guys and dealership as I purchased from.  They just filed bankruptcy, moved to another location and changed their name!!!!!)

I told the finance guy (Greg) to please not send my app all over the place looking for an approval.  One or 2 inquiries was enough if he know what he was doing.  Well he proceeded to blast my application to 12 DIFFERENT BANKS!  If my credit wasn't bad enough when we started, it sure as hell was when he was done.

They took my vehicle in on trade and I had to get the State of Arizona involved to get them to make the payoff to the bank.  Had they paid it off right away as they told me they would, I would have gotten several hundred dollars back.  As it took 45 days to make final payoff, I got back about $12.00!

Now they have filed for bankruptcy(5-20-14 Arizona Business Bankruptcy Case #2:14-bk-07683), moved 32 blocks west, and changed their name................... but a leopard cannot change it's spots as the saying goes.

Though I have moved from the area, I still tell my friends and family to avoid this place at all costs.

Please be careful and think long and hard before you consider taking your business and your hard earned money to these guys."
1,1,Please go somewhere else. After paperwork is done they miss treat you. I sat there why they put a place on for someone and just gave me my plate because they were mad about a google review. Said my payments was going to start in 45 days no how about 2 weeks. Talk to the finance company and they said that the so called dealership could have asked for it but didnt. I guess since paperwork done it was BYE FELICIA.
1,1,"I recently purchased a car from them and after taking the car home the following day I noticed it had a weird sound when starting it up and would remain there I returned to the dealership to have it fixed since under warranty they took the car and had it for 3 days and when I got it back they had fixed nothing in fact after driving it for less than a mile my check engine light came on. I went to take it back to have it fixed again and they asked me to speak with the finance company to let them know that I like the car I refused to state I'm satisfied with the car until they fixed it to my satisfaction, then the owner told me to drop off the car then they would sell it to someone else. And that I would not receive my down payment back. I went to this dealership to finally get a car and I finally saved up enough for the down (while paying for bills, we all know how hard that is ),and because it had high reviews, I have no idea why the customer service I received was horrific and I've never dealt with an owner of a company who is so rude to his customers. I would never recommend this place to anyone else!"
1,1,"If I could give this place a zero I would. The sales person my brother dealt with was so unprofessional. All he wanted was money off the bat and after he got $1500.00 down, he then says we can't get the car that day because the car hasn't passed emissions yet!!!! We asked if it was standard procedure to not let the customers know that the car has not been through emissions, but all we got was an attitude from the sales person stating that he didn't know either. Sooo .. this person is selling cars, but doesn't know anything about the condition of the car or what needs to be done?! We then asked for a refund, but he stated he couldn't do anything because the owner ""just"" left. He left after he swiped our card for $1500.00 and a couple minutes later ""left"". Since my brother needed a car and is working to repair his credit, we went with the deal anyway. We asked for written document stating they received the $1500.00 plus what the deal was, that emissions would pass and the deal would be completed the following day, but all the sales person tried to give was just a receipt. After demanding a written document , we finally got it. AVOID this place at all costs!"
1,1,"this is one of the worst car dealers in town! i went to this trouble car lot 08/20/2017 on a 'sunday saw a car i wanted, which wasn't all that great! i thought maybe i'll give it a try and fix the car up myself. i talked to a salemans who had no experience! not professional! dressed in allstars tennis shoes, jeans, t-shirt! this guy & fraudulant scam owner! i talked to them both about how much i wanted my car payements to be $285 not over $300. the unexperience salesman told me he can give me 72 months to pay this car off! with out a doubt! well so as the owner told me the same thing! this car was online for $9,355 when i get down their this unprofessional salesman & scam owner boost the price up to $10,999! i put a $2,000 down in total i counld not drive the car of the lot because it was on a 'sunday. the very next day i was suppose to go back too pick the car up, with my car notes being under $300 as promised! i called the next day 'monday all day! total of 8 hours calling to see did the bank approved me with my car notes being under $300 this unexperience unprofessional salesman kept telling me, when the bank call, i'll give you a call! finally i called ask to speak to someone one in the finance dept! this lady who i talk to straight out told me i was appoved with my car notes being! $350 a month i told her that,thats not what the salesman & the owner promised me that my notes will be under $300 a month! this unprossional lady from finance dept puts me on hold to go ask the scam owner! gets back on the line with a very, very nasty attuide tells me! thats not what the owner told you! she then tells me the owner said you can drive off the lot with your payements being $350 or come get your money back! as tried as i was getting off, of work a 1 hour 30 mins to get down to the car lot! i gladly got my money back! the unexperience unprofessional salesman was stiill, wear allstars tennis shoes, jeans, t-shirt the owner came out very rudy! not speaking! they really must have thought i was really that despeate! i would not recommand this carlot to anyone if it was the last car lot on the plant earth! if the can get over on you & think you desperate they will! if i can give them a 0.0000000000000000 star i would have!"
1,1,"Found their website after going by many times, I filled out the application online and got a voicemail the next day saying I was pre-approved, lie #1. I filled out the online app for a particular Ford Escape so I was excited. When I got there they had five cars for sale, not the 25 plus on their website, lie #2. While waiting for the dealer I thought I was working with another guy walks up, nice guy and we started talking about the other cars they had. It was pretty clear talking about a Kia Sorrento that he knew nothing about cars, I ended up showing him how to tell if it was a 4 or 6 cylinder. Ok so luckily I knew enough about cars to know what I was looking at, he had me looking at a white 2012 Kia Soul, not at all what I went in for but it met my needs. As it turns out it was out only because a couple had just been looking at it but walked away from the deal, I kept an open mind though. Being a car nerd I asked what engine it had so my my dealer googled it, says it was a 2.0 liter which I hoping and that it was all wheel drive (I was 90% sure Souls only came front wheel drive) but not being sure I kept quiet. So we go inside to crunch the numbers, on the online app I put I had $500 to put down, he had asked if I could do $1000, I reluctantly said yes, meant I'd be eating raman till payday but also meant I didn't have to take the bus home. My dealer went and talked to his guys and came back and asked if was good with the  $1000dwn and $280/mo for 36mo, I agreed. Of course nothing we agreed on was going to work once they talked to the bank, they now wanted more down and wanted me to promise more towards the down in two weeks. By that point I left, pissed that I had wasted so much time. When I got home I got a call from the sales manager there telling me they would accept $1200 down, I agreed to return the next morning. The next morning I message the salesman asking if can confirm the engine, he admitted it was the 1.6 liter, I said that their price of $7999 was too much, he seemed to be on my side. He came back and said it was $5300, ok so 8 grand to 5300, now we are getting somewhere. So obviously I inquired on how that would change the down and/or monthly payments, and was told  $1200 down and now $280 a month. As it turns out his sales manager told him $5300 but failed to mention all of their fees made it, hold your breath,...... $8000. They kept telling me to come down but I was done at that point. I know this review was long but I'm hoping mine and the other reviews on here will discourage folks from going down, there are hundreds of dealerships in the valley to choose from. I did end up getting my Escape. I should also mention that I was inenvertly told that they buy their cars at auction, run through the car wash and change the oil, that's it."
1,4,"It seems that miserable people are the only ones who ever write a review. I am writing this today because what others have said here, is nothing like what I experienced at A to Z. Fist off,  what used car dealership ever gets good reviews?  People don't seem to understand that they are buying a USED vehicle, that someone else sold for what ever reason.  The plus side here is that at least at A to Z, the service my truck needed was done right there. It took them a day to get parts and I got it back the next day. They seemed to be your typical dealership except they loaned me a car while my truck was getting fixed. I went there with all the paperwork that was needed ( I called ahead and found out what was needed) so I was only there for about an hour and 15 minutes.  I had them put in writing what they agreed to fix on the truck I wanted.  They worked with me on the down payment, and so far everything is going good.  The sales people could be more smart about the vehicles they are showing, but other than that they all seemed to be polite and eager to sell the vehicle.  I think this place is better than most, at least they didn't lie to me about fixing my truck.  I even got a free 3 month  warranty.  So I am happy overall.  I say to give this place a shot, plus its rare to find a dealership with an A Rating with the BBB.  Just get everything in writing so you feel more secure."
1,1,"a ONE is giving this place tooo much credit. The owner steals your down payment and puts you into the junk cars they have on the lot. And they have false advertisement saying everyone is approved. They get you to come in based on saying cars they have on their website are available but when you go there, they are not. It could be the same while you are sitting in their parking lot and they will say sure we still have it come on in. And it's not there at all, then they lie and say they just sold it  an hour ago. Lies lies lies. I could go on and on, but I would like to add this lastly, the owner is very flirtatious with females and appears to have a few ladies at the dealership that he frequents with just based on watching my surroundings while waiting for the lies from the sales manager to start.  Very unprofessional environment on top of the junk cars. All the cars have internal issues and incompetent staff. The only nice thing about it was two young ladies named Tonya and Ticia, who were both very professional. I hope they both find a real dealership to work for. I got stuck buying a car because of my situation but I'm telling you DO NOT BUY FROM A TO Z AUTO MALL, THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF."
5,5,"This was my 3rd visit to State Trailer.  I was blown away with their CUSTOMER SERVICE! 
Josh helped me find the right size hitch from my new 4x6 trailer. He did a great job making sure that my trailer was safe to drive with a 12 in drop hitch, by showing me how to measure for the right hitch.   He passed it off to Bryan at the parts counter who ordered my hitch and was AWESOME!  I asked him about flooring for the bottom of the trailer and he recommended a rugged mat for the bottom of the mesh trailer.  He then introduced me to Justin, the service technician, and he offered to help me secure the new mat to my trailer.  The customer service at State Trailer is TOP NOTCH from top to bottom.  I highly recommend stopping in for a refreshing change from the other guys..."
5,5,"Very good experience here - they got my rig right in for a bearing repack and when I had some issues with my travel trailer hitch - Josh, the service manager came out personally to troubleshoot. I was totally satisfied and will use them again. Thanks Josh!"
5,5,"This is a great store with very competitive prices and very friendly staff! They also have a FREE shoppers card. If you need parts for your rv/camper, they will give you options and order it if they don't have the part in stock."
5,5,"My second visit to State Trailer and my wife's third and the service compares to none. Every employee  we asked for help was super helpful and knowledgeable. This trip we went to buy a battery based on a recommendation last time we were there and Justin, one of the service techs came up to me and asked me if it was my truck in the parking lot leaking everywhere. Of course I hoping it wasn't, but it was and he walked me out to my truck to show me, and he spent several minutes with me looking over my tow vehicle. Thank you Justin for help me identify the issue. Most likely you save me a bunch of money. I appreciate you guys before and I appreciate even more now. I will make sure to tell everyone I know about the great service you guys provide."
5,4,"While in Phoenix for appointments a couple weeks ago, I stopped at State Trailer on the recommendation of a friend to get some RV supplies.  I expected sort of a smaller Camping World type store but I was very pleasantly surprised.  State Trailer might have a little less square feet than some CW stores, but they had every bit of their inventory and then some.  They had a number of items CW doesn't have and for the most part the prices were better.  And more importantly, I got great help from very professional employees who bent over backwards to be helpful.  I plan to go back when I have to go back to Phoenix soon."
5,4,"This is a surprisingly helpful place whether you just need to use their dump station that's free or need parts for your RV. Lots of extra accessories to customize your camping or vacation trip at relatively affordable prices. Obviously they provide propane service at competitive prices and they're always pleasant to deal with.
The great thing for us is their proximity and easy access which is always a plus. You may want to call them in advance to make appointments for service to Motorhomes while you wait in their small but clean lobby/lounge in the back. Clean restrooms next to it are always nice.
Hopefully this business will stay around for a long time. They have a nice extensive catalog you would do well to pick up also. If they don't have a certain part available they can order it for you online and install it in most cases.
Luckily I've not had any major work done yet so I can't speak to their service dept. integrity or expertise but I've heard good things from others while shopping there and outside of the store. As far as I know this is the only location in the metro Phoenix area currently. 
Recommend checking them out if you're in Peoria. It's located off of Peoria Ave./83rd/Grand near downtown Peoria in a large clean and renovated, well lit and safe parking lot."
5,5,"Well stocked inventory, I like that they have hardware, electrical & plumbing parts. I find generally everything I need here. Propane was a good deal. Customer service is great."
5,5,My husband and I just got our first RV so we have a lot of questions. We both had our questions answered by Eon he was very knowledgeable and very polite.  He not only answered the questions but showed us where and what to do. Than we need information on getting a window replaced so Bryan was so nice and helpful once again great customer service!! Thank you both for the help.
5,5,"This place is awesome!!
Service department is great !!!
Recommend getting all trailer and RV gear there.
Staff is very customer friendly."
5,5,"I found State Trailer RV by looking up  RV stores on yelp. I went there several times to check it out after I found out that they have a free dump station. The dump station is truly free.
I then needed some work done on my new trailer(new to me). I want the axle flipped and add a carrier on the back. I had the trailer there to dump after a weekend out. They came out and looked at it and told me what the price would be for flipping the axle. They also recommended some new springs. 
I schedule the work a few week later. They took about a week to complete the work. They made the carried to my drawing and flipped the axle. I was impressed with the work and the friendliness of the staff also the price was more than competitive. I will recommend this store to anyone that needs service done to their RV. They also have a great selection of RV parts and outdoor Items. I never knew there was so many things for a RV!"
5,5,"Did a muffler delete here with my GTI. I highly recommend this shop, Russ works pretty hard and knows what he's doing. Extremely reasonable price as well as it's much cheaper than anything else around town. Easy 5 stars"
5,5,"They have done a great job on previous work for me in the past at their Phoenix location, so I was happy to see that they now have a location closer to me.  I wanted a new exhaust for my car.  They were quick to respond.  I took my car in on Wednesday for them to check it out.  Unfortunately for me, they didn't have the part on hand as they just finished installing it on a Mazda and needed to order one.  They called me on Friday to let me know the part came in and installed it Friday afternoon.  Car sounds great.  Definitely recommend Performance Muffler.  Thanks Russ."
5,3,"Went to Pro Muffler based on reviews, nice people and said they would order my muffler and call, 4 days later i called them and they said they forgot and would order it and call me the next day when it came in,,,,,no call two days later i went to Midas in Sun City and had a new muffler in less than an hour!"
5,5,Needed a piece of tube bent for a project.  turned out that the tube I had wouldn't bend right with their bender. They had the same size pipe but different type in stock that would work for my project (non exhaust related) they bent it to my specs in just a few mins and didn't cost much at all.  Ended up fitting perfect.  thank you pro muffler will be back for a flowmaster in the future.
5,5,Great shop fast and inexpensive muffler sounds great I had a missfire in my engien that cause my cat to go bad they found out and had it fixed with the mechanic shop next door
5,4,"Found this company on Yelp. Good reviews!
I called and spoke with Russ about my car he let me know to bring my car in so he could take a look at it.

When I arrived Russ came out and looked under my car and we discussed best option for what I wanted.

Shop had a few cars ahead of me so I left and returned at scheduled time. 

They pulled my car onto lift and got to work. 

Lots of walk ins and phone calls for the majority of time I was there. 

I do feel like it took a bit long for what I had done, but I am very patient. 

Prices are good and they do stock a variety of Muffler tips.

Lots of hard office chairs to sit while you wait and a classic soda machine.

I'd suggest a receptionist based on the foot traffic and phone calls. Swap out all the chairs for a few comfortable ones.

I will be a return customer thank you."
5,5,I highly recommend Pro Muffler. Quality work at a reasonable price. Why can't all businesses follow that example? The automotive world is a better place thanks to them. Very pleased with the results on 2 of my performance cars. Will bring the others as the need arises (soon). Thanks guys! See you in the new year.
5,5,Amazing service! I loved everything about the outcome of my car. Not too loud where it bothers hurts annoys but gave my car a tone. I now enjoy stepping in the gas and just ripping it up! Would come here for every car I buy!
5,4,"Price: Unbeatable 
Wait time: Substantial
Work: Not perfect, but for the price it's great. 
The shop is first come, first serve. They open on Saturday 8am-12pm. I arrived at 7:30 and was second in line. My car was not finished until 10am but the crowd in the waiting room passed the time by chatting with one another so it was a pleasant experience. I brought a cat back system and had it installed here, I also asked them to cut the mufflers out and replace them with a straight pipe. I requested that they re-use the stock exhaust hangers and weld the system (which was in pieces) together but not to modify or attach anything permanent to the car itself. The welds aren't superiorly beautiful but they're functional and neat. This shop also does exhaust repair, custom systems, muffler deletes and more."
5,5,"James Rocks!!! had a problem with emissions, went into here as the are right by me. James told me to come in the next day and we slapped some cats on no problem. I passed emissions no problem. Prices are good, workmanship is great. This is not a huge shop, they can be busy at times, but their work is great. I've found my new muffler shop."
5,5,"Got a recommendation from a friend about Pro Muffler.  When I arrived I spoke to Lucas.  They were able to get me in right away with no appointment.  Had a Exhaust system installed & Lucas was professional, knowledgeable & did a clean & concise job."
5,5,"I was Shopping around for a muffler and not really sure of what I was looking for but Russ helped me out! This company is knowledgeable, gave me a quote over the phone and that's exactly what I paid.  I even left my truck over night because of my schedule and when I picked it up there were no issues and the work and parts they installed are working great! My truck sounds awesome.  Thx!"
5,5,I got a cat back exhaust system installed from performance muffler about 6 years back using all the parts they had in house. Never had any issues since. The did a great job and would recommend them to others
5,5,"Threw on my flowmasters and couldn't be fucking happier, transformed my cars exhaust system into a beast!!!"
5,5,"Just want to add our 5 star review.   In April, we purchased a ""new to us"" 2004 Mercedes SL 500.  We wanted to see if we could improve the performance of our car.  We found this shop to be honest, knowledgeable, reasonable, professional and they do quality  work.  We are more than happy with our car.  We have even experienced better gas mileage.  Would recommend Pro Muffler to everyone."
5,5,Great service from Marcus. Took his time to make the exhaust fit perfect. Would recommend anyone here!
5,5,Three other shops had quoted us between $900 and $1100 for a catalytic converter replacement.  James had us OUT THE DOOR for only $210.  Car passed emissions and runs perfectly.  What more can you ask for?
5,5,I just had my Flowmaster outlaw exhaust installation done here and it was quick and painless. The sound is awesome and the install price was good. So far I am happy with what I got.
5,5,"These guys are awesome. I found this shop on Yelp after being frustrated with my regular shop quoting me a high price for a repair. I talked to James on the phone and from that conversation I could tell that he was honest and to the point. Upon looking at my car he told me that it was a simple repair that would cost only $40 and it would only take 10 mins. How's that for service. Honesty and low cost, two things that you don't usually associate with car repair shops. You get my full endorsement of James and the whole Pro Muffler Team."
5,5,"That right....5 stars for James. James does the exhaust work and for some reason is always busy?  I finally had to sit and wait one day, every other day I called he had cars lined up.  Several hours of waiting.  Well I only waited one hour after finding a day I could wait.  Overall the welding work he does is excellent. 
I did not bring in a show car or anything, but the welding on the exhaust looks like James takes pride in his work.  Great job James, I am supper happy and suggest anyone needing exhaust work talk to James."
1,1,"Manager is a monster. They took rent money from my checking account without my authorization. I called to inquire. Lady named Izzy responded ""I didn't do it"". I asked how can anyone take money from my account without my approval. She snapped! That's it. Raise your voice to me. You have 72 hours to get your stuff out. This is your 72 hour eviction notice. The very next day they took another months rent. Do not give them your debit or account info!!! This lady is the meanest, rudest most unprofessional person I've ever encountered in my entire life. Too bad the owners of this business have no idea who they have running their business. I've tried through the BBB and certified mail to contact them. She obviously intercepts the mail and keeps it from them. Go az storage inns less than 2 miles away. Very professional and truly appreciate you as a customer. Horrible, horrible experience. And I was a 2 time customer here. This time 2 years."
1,1,"The manager is rude, disrespectful and very confrontational. Rates are good and the outside storage so so, but the manager needs a lesson in customer service.  On our first visit to sign up she belittled one of her associates to us telling us how useless he was and he should be fired and on our second experience with her, did not acknowledge our presence, when questioned about a concern we had threw a document across the table at us and screamed that we were evicted. All this in front of another customer. A nastý, nasty person that should not be in the people serving industry. The one star is for the rate."
1,1,"Terrible experience with the management. Failed to auto bill and threatened us.  Lost our rental records. Twice. Failed to auto bill a second time and called to threaten us again. Nasty rude manager, and Co-worker always looks hung over, filthy, and baffled. Never again."
2.5,1,"they keep my trailer over 6 week to fix my hight bid . i try to call them 2 time and left the messages to find out when it done , never call me back . i when there to get my trailer to some place can help me .when i get there they toll me my trailer need new camper i toll them first you toll me you can fix it than keep for over 6 week then say need new one ? i said no thanks i need to get my trailer back they toll me wait for 4 hour to put my camper back . i go home to wait , they call me haft hour say my trailer ready for pickup , they want me to pay $580.00 for labor i said you did not fix why i have to pay ? then she sent me to the manager i toll him the same then he said  or i have to pay $60.00 for the estimate or he won't let me have the trailer . i call 911 then he change the way he talk and let me have my trailer back before cop show up . they are not reliable , lie . stay away from this dealer ."
2.5,4,"Great service department, they are very thorough and were very helpfully with their recommendations. We didn't have everything done but I liked the options to proceed in the future. They have a huge facility for sales and service. They were also able to get my camper trailer done in a week in a half from the time I dropped it off. Only complaint I could have is when I first went in to service it took someone about 10 minutes to greet me while I stood at the counter while many people were behind the counter working on paperwork. I couldn't tell if I should ask for help or not. After that every visit has been quickly greeted so it may have been just a bad day. I'd go back for the service techs alone. They do great work."
2.5,1,"Horrible experience indeed!!!!
Not pleased at all. Horrible service. Truck went in on 4-20-17 picked up on 06-07-17 with only one phone call returned during entire time, despite me calling multiple times and leaving messages. This place charges for ""diagnostics"" like doctors do. No service is rendered.  Rip off is rendered.  I will never go back. I wish I could give them a zero score!!!!"
2.5,1,"Took my Monaco in to have an very minor air leak fixed. phillip offered to give an estimate to remove the aligatored 3M mask. Told him I had it looked at before, been told it wont come off, dont worry or do it. Picked up my coach, air ride level was way off, had to have it fixed elsewhere. Also, when they tried to give an estimate for removing the 3M they sprayed chemicals right in the middle of the front, quarter size white spots on my dark brown. They also tried to scrape it, big chunks missing. Then gave me an estimate for $4,000 to re-paint it, saying it wont come off. And to top it off, he charged $30 FOR THE ESTIMATE. Got the 30 back, but now think of them every time I look at my coach. I wont be back."
2.5,5,I took my recently purchased 99 Ford Class B on two different occasions to this LDLP location with a simple question each time. Both times everyone was very helpful - the technicians and the service representatives. I know they have a long wait time for a service appt. but I felt like they try to be as helpful as they can given this. I would definitely take my vehicle there again.
2.5,1,"Giving one star is all I can honestly give.  Our experience from start to finish with this location and dealership was very unpleasant!!  I cannot recommend this dealer to anyone, nor will we ever purchase from them again.

In late February we looked at a unit, high pressured into putting a deposit down and we were told their books showed the new units in stock and due there in about 14 days.  We left, went back a week later and decided to put down over $3000 on the unit, because we intended to buy and the unit would supposed to be in very soon.  Over the next 5 weeks, we called weekly and were told the same thing ""It's in route"".  When we started demanding more info, they pulled in a unit from another dealer-a cheaper unit and a really rough looking unit that appeared used and tried to get us to purchase it.  We declined!  We demanded info on our unit, having already cancelled 2 camping trips and tired of waiting...plus my check was cashed weeks prior.  We learned the unit was never in route and wasn't due in for 2 more weeks.  

We waited, with a run around, for over 7 weeks for this unit to come in.

Next thing is to get my brake controller installed.  Guess what, they blew the fuse!!!  I sat in the passenger seat for 4.5 hours waiting patiently and watching no less than 4 technicians try to figure out why they couldn't get this thing wired.  I asked to leave several times and take it to the dealership and they wouldn't let me go.  My car service guy finally got on the phone with them and lied to LD so they'd let me leave.  The car dealer fixed the fuse, installed the controller for me and didn't charge me a dime.  This was an epic fail imo!!!

Once it arrived, we took possession quickly.  Upon charging the fridge, the night before our first trip, we realized the fridge wasn't getting cold.  At 9am, the day we were to leave, we take it back to the dealer to learn the PCO was NEVER done, even though we paid $598 for it.  Nothing was checked.  The fridge was in fact bad and had to be replaced.  3 hours late to hit the road, we're off.  Now, we are camping and the sink doesn't drain.  Yay us...again, they didn't do their job.

In every facet of this sale/purchase...nothing went right and so much went wrong.  Totally disappointed in LDLP!"
2.5,4,"We buy a lot of our motorhome parts here. Plus we get it serviced in the service department, and they allow dogs in the store!"
2.5,1,"What a joke! Asked the lady that greeted us if they had something small that could be towed with a motorcycle or small SUV, she had no clue what we were even talking about.  She sent us to what i call the camp coral inside the dealership to look at Toy Haulers. We DID NOT ask to see those!! She told us a salesperson would be right with us. Well guess what ?! Not one person showed up to help. We were cash buyers and ready to do business on this day. Drove 40 miles for absolutely nothing. These place isn't worthy of any stars."
2.5,1,"Save your money and your time, service department very poorly run.  Had some warranty service to be performed so took 5th wheel in.  They had rig for over 2 months and never called me.  When I called them, picked rig up and went North with only some warrantee items complete. Upon return South, I thought give them another chance.  MISTAKE.  Same ole run around.  Narrowed it down to 2 items to be fixed.  Neither done well and 2 weeks now and no phone call from Service Manager.  How they can stay in business with all these service complaints, unreal!"
2.5,1,Doesn't even deserve a star! The place is a joke and an absolute rip off. Left my RV in December didn't get it back until May. Called me twice in those several months.  No communication.  Then they fire just about everyone I will never step foot in the place again. The work is crappy the price is crappy the whole dealership is crappy.
2.5,1,Last review on 08/11 still dont have a window. I have given up and called Jake multiple times just to get my window frame back to no avail. They tried a couple other shells they thought might fit my truck but all they achieved was to waste my time (again) and scratch up the bed of my truck! Now all I want is to be done FOREVER with these guys and get my window frame back and I bet I can find someone to replace it....If they havent lost the frame...And one star is just because I had to give something.
2.5,1,"With a the building and set up as nice and they have you would think the customer service would be a little better. The reason this place has such terrible reviews is because they prejudge everyone who walks in the door. We walked around for 45 minutes without a single employee asking us if we needed anything, or had any questions. 
We happily went elsewhere and had a completely different experience.  

Trust the reviews below ... They are true"
2.5,4,"UPDATED REVIEW:  They've remodeled the parts area, and it's impressive.  There's an even larger selection of stuff, and it's clean and organized now.  The parts counter people have always been pretty helpful. 

I also went to look at trailers one time.  I let them know that I was just looking today and not ready to do a deal today, so they left me alone to look around without bugging me.  Unfortunately nobody makes what I'm looking for, so I didn't spend a lot of time talking to sales.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Prices are decent and the parts selection is pretty good (and expanding).  I needed some RV and trailer parts, which all ended costing about the same as online prices.  The parts area isn't great as far as organization and cleanliness, but the stuff is there."
2.5,1,DO NOT SELECT THIS DEALERSHIP. READ THE REVIEWS AND SAVE YOURSELF A HUGE AMOUNT OF HEADACHE AND MONEY. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS We bought a Jayco Seismic that has had ongoing problems since the day we bought it all related to the jacks. Every 2-3 uses they break. Now we are out of regular warranty and no one will help with an ongoing problem from day 1. Go to a reputable dealership that cares about its customers and values the service they give. If I could select no stars on the review I would
2.5,3,checked in about 10 am for a couple hour job & are still waiting at 4:30!!! what a waste of a gorgeous day!
2.5,3,"Found the trailer we really liked, Amber the sales girl was nice not pushy at all which was nice. They gave me a great price on trailer we chose and on my trade. Everything going great, next stop finance. Michelle was wonderful and very helpful. Next stop walk through enter Jeff, again hits a home run, very patient, incredibly helpful, the best part of our experience so far. That is when we were taken to parts. Told John is our point of contact. We arrive and clearly we are interrupting  their conversation and the snotty comment from John that he is not in parts along with the attitude, takes me to Gus. Lucky me I get to wait until he and the parts person finish their story about the night before. Now even better for me I don't have all the rv language to describe what I need. I get the condescending tone, and the your wasting my time demeanour. In comes parts manager to save the day, he does a nice job attempting to rectify the situation.
Summary, stay away from parts, I have serviced my rv in the past here and they are very high priced. I would recommend looking somewhere else first and ONLY shop here at a last resort. I will not be back"
2.5,1,"Literally the worst service department in the valley, Rude, Unprofessional and flat out liars. I have a Diamond Extended Warranty with one of the most reputable warranty companies out there (interstate star RV warranty) and when I took my $75K Toy Hauler in for a Kitchen slide that wouldn't go out. He priced out the parts and said the slide motor was $400+ dollars and the warranty company was only going to cover the actual cost of the motor which was $140. I did some basic research and the warranty company was correct, I personally could buy that motor online for $124. I told Steven Vega the service adviser that I was not going to pay the difference and that if they could not do it for what warranty would pay for then just give it back to me and I would replace the motor. Steve then called me back on December 29th and said he could get everything done for no additional cost and I said Steve so you are telling me everything is covered and he said Yes. Today on January 13th Steve called to tell me my RV was ready and when I asked what my portion of the total was he told me I owed $200+ dollars for the difference on the motor and I told you I did not authorize that motor if it was not covered. So I told him they could take the motor off and I was not paying for it or the labor since I did not authorize it. He said that they would charge me for the labor to remove it. So now I have to fight with his management and my attorney to get my RV back. Do yourself a favor run, run and run again if you are thinking of getting anything done at Little Dealer Little Prices."
2.5,1,"SERVICE DEPT WILL RIP YOU OFF with open-ended diagnostic fees (starting at $130+/hr) and even a $45 ""shop-fee"" that will be tacked on at the end. If you know what's wrong, then pay them to fix it, but beware of having them ""check something out"" because that's how they screwed me on warranty work. Mike and Phil know how to scam you with nickel and dime B/S charges. Took a month to get minor things repaired.

This company took care of me in sales, so naturally I trusted the company to take care of me in service. That was a poor decision. Lesson learned. Next time, their competition will be taking care of me in everything. I will NEVER use Little Dealer ****-Prices' service department again.

For a business with such a family legacy, they have scammers running the service dept. Nobody likes to be ripped off. This burn will be remembered when we upgrade."
2.5,1,"WOW. I just got a talking to by the manager for shopping around for the best price. I called in to do a comparative price on a deal i have he actually told me that people like me get him upset, calling dealer to dealer to make someone low ball an offer. I asked him, am I suppose to take the 1st offer I get and say I bet this is the best i can do. he did not like that and told me that and basically told me to take my business elswhere"
2.5,1,Share!!! Please!!! Listen up... went to little dealer little prices today... really wanted to buy a pop up!!! How insulting trying to sell me a 2016 model for over the cost of a 2017 with more options. Not only that but they tried to say the model-same stock number and model I saw online was sold!!!! Really!??? I will get my camper but buyer beware they will treat you like a used car salesman from 1970... they even bust out that old trick of taking your ID (why you don't test drive a pop up!) and the good ol' four square and rocket pen trick!!!!
2.5,1,"Worst experience ever. Went in was quoted a high price and told that was the ""best"" they could do. Called after I found the same trailer at a dealership out of town. Told them I was going to get the other trailer that day unless they could match it. He assured me multiple times over the phone he would match it and do whatever to make it happen but I needed to come back in. Went back to little dealer and spoke with the same person who took forever to see us. 
We got there spent two hours mostly with him gone and then had the manager come out extremely rude to tell us to go to the other dealership if we wanted that deal. Manager was terrible will never recommend this place to anyone and Huge waste of time when we made it absolutely clear we were busy and needed to get it done. If you're looking for an RV save your time and go somewhere that knows what customer service is."
2.5,3,"We stopped in to see what they have in pop-up campers. We weren't planning to buy anything, but wanted to get some ideas on what's available and pricing. We enjoyed going through their showroom, which is set-up like a night time campground. They have quite a few models on display from pop-up campers to fully loaded RV's. 

We found a couple things of interest. Talked with one of the sales people for more information. They were very helpful. Gave us some brochures and talked to us about options. 

Worth checking out if you're in the market for a new camper or RV."
2.5,1,The only little thing in their price is what they offer for your trade in. Just purchased a 2017 Wildwood 30qbss from a dealer in Tucson. The two hour drive saved us about 7 grand and over 2points in interest. Before buying I offered them the chance to match the price of the other dealer and they wouldn't. Guess they depend on the uneducated consumer.
2.5,1,"Do your self a favor and do not take your RV/trailer here for service. The worst experience ever. They have the trailer for 1 month and replace the wrong part. Than when I take it back for them to replace the correct part. They told me it would only take 2 hours, It took 2 days. My jack was broke and there is a nice big scratch on the side of the trailer. Customer service is horrible, no call backs, not friendly at all. They advertise a lifetime warranty through there dealership. That is a joke! Who would want to deal with there service department for a lifetime. I would have gave them minus 5 stars if I could have."
2.5,1,"This place is the worst for customer service. 

I went in to look at motor homes, with money to spend, and the salesman refused to unlock them and let me look. He was trying to tell me what I needed to buy instead of me looking at different options and make the decision on my own. I will never spend money with this rude, unprofessional establishment."
2.5,1,Bought a new rv from them . The sales experience was great but unfortunately the service department after has been horrible! When you have warranty issues and have to wait over a month with no results seems very unacceptable
2.5,3,"I have worked with Little Dealer Little Prices for 4 years. They put a new stove in my Living Quarters Horse trailer and did a great job!!! I was in and out in a timely manner. I sold that Living Quarters Horse Trailer and purchased a different trailer. I had them work on my current trailer last year, 2017. I had to wait 3 weeks to get an appointment. I had them work on my generator with other repairs. I got home turned on generator but won't run my air conditioner. Hummm you would think they would of tested that??? I told them I was leaving on a trip the following week and need generator fixed. They could not get me in for another week and definitely not before my trip. So I had somethings fixed but my generator was not one of them. It's hot here in September and no AC. They got generator fixed after my trip it ran good all Fall.
This year I go to start generator and it's a not working. So I called and had to wait another 3wks to get an appointment!!! I use my horse trailer everyday to haul horses and ride. I told them this when I made appointment. Dropped trailer off on Monday 8am. I want to be sure they start working on my trailer today. Yes was my answer. I didn't hear anything Monday or Tuesday.  
I called at 9:15 Wednesday and they told me they were going to start working on it TODAY!!!! Why didn't they schedule appointment for Wed if they had it sitting there for 2 days!!! I told them forget it!!! I called Platinum trailers and they referred me to OFF THE PORCH. He had trailer fixed next day. He came to my house and fixed it in 2 hours for a VERY REASONABLE PRICE!!!!"
2.5,2,"The salesman was pretty nice if a bit pushy. Once we bought our camper and required some warranty work, things went downhill. We left messages which weren't returned. We left our camper at their location on Deer Valley Road for over three weeks and only finally made contact after repeated phone calls. At this stage -- at least 6 weeks later -- we're still waiting to hear when the warranty repairs will be completed. Add to that. some of the items on our list did not seem to make it onto their list of repairs so we have to go through the whole process again. This not a great dealership."
2.5,5,"We took our 5th wheel in for some warranty work. A friend recommended us to Phillip Mayes and I'm glad he did. Phillip was courteous, helpful and friendly. It's not easy to find people to trust but we can trust Phillip."
2.5,1,A joke of a dealership. I have cash in hand to buy a toy hauler over six figures and the sales guy had zero product knowledge and completely wasted my time. I'll go elsewhere to find what I need.
2.5,1,"We purchased a new travel trailer in early spring.  Service was supposed to check all systems and have them up and running.  We had our walk through and they answered any questions we had.  Didn't think to turn on the kitchen/bathroom sink.  Didn't think to test toilet.  They would have also noticed the door to the area under the tub was missing. This was our second trailer so we certainly had previous experience with running water and a functioning toilet.  We were more interested to make sure we knew about how to operate all the new ""bells & whistles"" this trailer had over our previous one.  We had our first camping trip in late April to high country.  We had no running water.  Didn't know if the pipes were frozen or what.  The second day we figured it wasn't a frozen pipe issue. We had to get the operating instructions out only to discover the water valve to all facets/toilet was closed.  No reason for it to be closed off!  Then we discover the toilet wouldn't hold water for flushing.  Thought we could make it through the camping season with a malfunctioning toilet. NO!  It's under warranty so we took it to the the closet shop that does warranty work, Camping World, and it's been 6 weeks. A whole new toilet and under tub door had to be ordered. IF Little Dealer Little Prices had checked ALL systems, done what they are supposed to do, we would have had running water and they would have replaced the toilet BEFORE we took possession, maybe pulled and under tub door from another unit. Because of faulty service for trailer startup, we are missing most and the best of camping system!! Warranty work takes FOREVER!"
2.5,1,"LIARS!!!!!
I live in Las Vegas and couldn't find the trailer I wanted to purchase at home. I did find it at this dealership and contacted Robert Vogel from the Mesa location. I communicated with Robert via email and he stated that the 2014 pop-up trailer that I was looking at didn't appear to have ever been used. He later told me that it was used once and the owners traded it in for a traditional unit. I was told there was nothing cosmetically wrong with the unit and everything was tested when they took it in as a trade. He said it smelled new when he walked in it.  I was visiting family in another state and flew into the Phoenix while my wife and kids drove the truck down from Las Vegas. We had a morning appointment to sign papers and the trailer was supposed to be cleaned and ready for the walk through as we had camping reservations in the area for a short family trip to break in the new trailer.

So we arrive there and I'm told that they are cleaning it, no biggie, they said the cleaner walked off the job. They bring the trailer out for us to inspect and start the walk thru process on the outside while someone is cleaning up the inside. The trailer is dirty and the canvas tent area is worn with small stains and markings. I open the inside and the counter has several large stains, the wood is dented and scratched. The cabinets are scratched and with chips. There was a rip in the tent over the bed and there where permanent black markings all over it. I reached to check the refrigerator unit and the plastic protector was missing a piece and broken. There were other issues but I'm sure you get the trailer was clearly not a like new, a used once trailer. The trailer smelled, not new. I was told by another employee that the trailer was not inspected except the water and gas line so unknown if everything else worked as Robert had stated. 

I told Robert about the problem and he said ""it's a used trailer, nothing I can do."" I asked to speak with his boss and he came out (Dallas, I think).  I showed him the problems and told him that we came down from Las Vegas to buy a like new trailer and the already above listed information. He told me that it could have been used once and could completely care less about Robert being a liar and my family coming down from another state.  I got nothing but attitude from both of these characters. They offered to sell me a new unit at about 5k over the price I was paying or reduce the price of the used trailer by $1200. 

I didn't buy anything from them, cancelled our camping spot and got a Hotel. Two other employees that overheard our conversations apologized for the business screwing us over. I know it, other employees know it and now you know it. Little Dealer Little Prices employs dishonest (Liars) salesman and obviously likes to promote them as well. If you're looking too get screwed, you've found the perfect dealership."
2.5,1,Horrible service! I took in a truck with a broken back window on my Century camper shell. 3 times in 4 weeks the WRONG window was ordered. Now they tell me that they cant get me a window so the insurance company wants to give me cash and send me on my way with no back window! I had to wait multiple times to have a installer even on the premises to discover that the wrong window was ordered again. They never followed up with me and I had to initiate all conversation.
2.5,2,"We had a wonderful experience today at this facility with Bill.  He was outgoing and friendly.  We are and have been camper owners for many years, but decided we needed to upgrade our current version.  Our needs were pretty specific (as most camper owners can attest to), so Bill showed us the limited inventory that was available with our requirements.  We really liked the units, but did not like the sticker price.  Bill assured us that they would give us a ""great deal"".  We patiently went back to the cubicle and filled out paper work.  When asked to fill out a credit application, we politely refused until a ""concrete"" sales price was presented.  Bill completed his paperwork and we were left awaiting the ""great deal"".  To our complete and utter shock we were advised that the Manager said that until we were ready to sign purchase papers on the spot, he would not be providing any camper prices.  Nor would he be providing any trade in values for our current unit.  We were specifically told that Little Dealer Little Prices would not be providing any numbers for us to shop around for a $500 savings.  We were further informed that we were probably the sort of people that would smile profusely and graciously promise to call back and would never be heard from again.

I have applied the 2 star rating because of our experience with Bill.  The ridiculous and aggressive sales approach, on the other hand, would not even gain one star.  We have certainly dealt with ""arm twisting"" in the past, but questioning our motives and integrity was way beyond the line.  Even though this dealer is less than ten minutes from our home, we will NEVER set foot in this establishment again.  However, we will be purchasing another camper from another dealer."
2.5,1,"We bought a new 2016 Forest River Wildwood and have regretted this decision ever since. The costs are adding up in maintenance fees and killing our retirement income we had wanted to spend on camping instead. One year into this purchase and the camper is falling apart. The tires on the camper were never balanced prior to the purchase and at 4,000 miles they were worn unevenly. The safety concern required us to purchase all new tires. The lug nuts were cross threaded and had to buy better stronger Hub caps because all 4 of them fell off while driving on a normal city road in Arizona. When we called Little Dealer Little Prices regarding this issue, we were told to go purchase them ourselves and given a price. They said nothing on these campers are made with high quality products and they are cheaply made. They sure didn't say that when they were ranting and raving for us to purchase it. They were eager to take our money and sell us this junk. The hub caps fell off the day of purchase. The outside shower door busted off the first time opening the door.. another added expense. The air conditioner fan shuts off and on continuously when in use and the return a/c vent broke off within a couple months of purchase. There is a huge crack in the shower pan that has rarely been used. However, water likely accumulated under this crack from the times it was used and now we are concerned about mold build up. A panel on the blinds snapped in half, likely dry rotted prior to purchase. There are no kids, pets, or any kind of rough use to this camper. It is just my husband and I. We have not been able to use this lemon of a camper as we had wanted. I would advise anyone looking into getting a camper to stay away from LDLP and to not invest their hard earned money into a Forest River product."
2.5,1,"Maybe my post here will get the attention of management here, since they continue to avoid my calls. Our brand new Jayco was bought here in the spring - good experience as far as the sale went. However, the second they started working on it there have been issues. It's now been over six months of the trailer being in and out of their shop for warrantee work and we're not any better off. In fact at one point they completely messed up the water tanks via installing a new underbelly and we had to cancel our trip over it. We bought a brand new trailer and have not had everything work on it yet and don't even have it on the side yard to go use it when we want. The time we have spent taking it up and back and on the phone is ridiculous and it's still not fixed after another three weeks until the shop. Parts are again ""approved"" by Jayco after two weeks of waiting, and again there is no estimate on how long it will take to get resolved. On top of it all, they don't return calls or communicate. It sure feels like they don't care about their warrantee customers, but we deserve better. After all, we did purchase the trailer here!

New trailer buyers - beware."
2.5,1,"UPDATE:  08/04/13

I regret to say that I am retracting my 5 star review as I've given the dealership multiple opportunities to make our interactions positive.  We purchased this toy hauler in September 2012.  Within that time frame (less than one year) we've had a toy hauler at their dealership for repairs no less than 4 months total.  This is a repair business so I understand you cannot take your toy hauler in one day and have it fixed the next day, however the time frame in which they keep your rigs is excessive!  We are going on over two months for our most recent repair and not sure we were are to get it back this time.  I do not blame the dealership for the manufacturer defects, however we've had constant problems with mis-communication, going back on commitments they made to us, lack in follow up, etc.  within the service department.  I have wasted so much time on calls and sending emails trying to get multiple repairs fixed.  I am not convinced that their repair work is quality either as they've have a huge attrition issue with employees.  The purchasing of the toy hauler equals a thumbs up.  The service aspect equals multiple thumbs down.  

If you are looking to purchase a trailer or you this location for service please, please, please - do your homework first!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would recommend this place to a friend!  We had great service with Michelle, the Sales Rep.  I loved how she is up front, very knowledgeable about the trailers, and she doesn't tell you something just to get a sale.  She understood our needs to help us narrow down to the toy hauler we wanted.  Over the course of a month, I emailed her multiple times with questions about the toy hauler and she replied the same day.  When we decided to buy the toy hauler, she was up front with the time frames, price, etc.  She always made herself available.  And the price was great!  When it was time for our walk through, Donald was great also.  Even though we owned a toy hauler previously, he still took the time to go through the new one with us inside and out.  It was a great experience from beginning to end."
2.5,1,"Save yourself a lot of frustration and heart ache!  Do not go here for service!  Could have gone anywhere and made the big mistake of finding this place.  I should have read the Yelp reviews As should you!  I think it was on their lot for two weeks and they did not even touch the RV!   No calls, no updates, I think they lost it on their lot and then made excuses.  They ""had to order parts"" but didn't know even what parts were ordered, when they would be in, or what was needed.  Trying to get a straight answer is not a reality here. Someone finally said that they were behind and hadn't had a chance to look at it.   How are these people even still in business?"
2.5,1,"Went into the deer valley location earlier today (technically yesterday, on Saturday) and since it's  a slow night here (graveyard shift), i decide to hop online to read reviews to see if anyone else had a bad experience there too, and based on my gut, I had a feeling the place would have their share of bad reviews, and WOWzers, boy do they! So it looks like I've dodged a bullet by deciding not to buy there next weekend, though it's not like I received much help, even if I had been ready to buy today. Which brings me to this, leaving a review about the numerous issues I had with that place (which should be renamed -Rude Dealers, with Unknown Prices) 

I'll list just some of the issues in detail below, but before I do, you should know, I'm not someone who normally writes reviews and rarely complains, but in this case I am, because I'm more than a little irritated by our experience at this dealership, as well as what I've just read from other reviewers about this place. Im guessing buying from them would be regretful.

Here's my dilemma, the dealership is the only place for MANY MILES that has a particular trailer model we have been leaning towards, so now what? 

Are we are forced to drive clear across town to buy the model from someone else? Or should we take a craps shoot and buy from that dealership, and then pray that we won't have problems down the line with our RV or with their unprofessional management, salespeople and possibly service dept?

I've said a lot already, but here's the meat and potatoes of my numerous issues with that place-

1st. No one helping until we had been there awhile, and even then not very helpful. Heck, we didn't even get a ""Hello, can we help you"" when we walked in, like other dealerships greeters do. Guess they're so busy they don't need our business, and don't mind just ignoring us.

2nd. Once we finally got a salesman, he didn't seem to care as much once I let him know that i wasn't going to purchase until we had some time to compare prices & talk it over. After that news, he couldn't bother to go find a price for us, because apparently it wasn't on his paper (And why wasn't it priced? Im not sure that part was entirely his fault) but you'd think he'd at least find out for us, but no. 
I guess he assumed that since he wasn't making money right then and there, that he no longer needed to treat me as such, he even started helping someone else, and left us hanging. So we still have no idea what the price is  Which is a shame, since we plan to buy in the next week or two.

I felt like we were treated as if we don't matter, since we were only looking today, and not yet buying. 
Very poor business ethics. 

3rd. Luckily I didn't bring my daughters, or this would've been a whole other review and probably a complaint in writting too, because anytime a salesman or manager (not sure which he was) Screams at a person the words 'F***ing Shit' along with other things with visible anger, it sets a very dark and uncomfortable tone.
I think the guy might have either been quitting or firing someone, because he also said something about 'Clock the F*** Out'

Hearing him scream ""clock the F out"" makes me think one of 2 things, either the skinny guy with a tatt on his leg was a salesman, and had such huge issues with that place that he felt the need to quit in a loud way just to let people know that he was clocking out of that joke of a place, or worse maybe he's a manager, and doesn't have enough sense to fire someone in a calm and professional way, but instead chose to scream at them to clock out. Which means, he likely can't control his temper enough to conduct himself in a respectful way if we begin to have issues with our RV and want to take advantage of their so called 'forever lifetime warrenty' Plan.

After reading the reviews, I can safely draw the conclusion that this company doesn't care to treat their customers or their children (with young ears) with any leval of respect.
Thankfully my daughters were not with me to hear the outburst.

For the company sake, I hope he's just a salesman that quit, and they start hiring salesmen of better quality, and then train the rest of the salesmen (like our guy) to treat people who are not quite ready to buy, the same as if they were ready.

But on a good note, they have an amazing indoor showroom that gives the feel of camping at night, including firepits, tents and bird sounds. It was actually really neat to see.
But sadly, it was literally the only good thing about the entire experience.

And lastly, they have a very confusing website, it's not user friendly. I've never experienced such a poorly developed site. That probably should have been my first indication that the place isn't the best choice. And it shouldn't be yours either.

Well, is 6am and time for me to ""Clock out"" too.
I'm tired, but I guess we'll need to drive across town to look at another dealership this morning."
2.5,1,"The biggest crooks, did not do what they said they would do but charged a huge amount, took 2 months  or longer , never returned phone calls, plus rats got in the motor home, I would not go there even if your desperate, your better off pulling into a McDonald's and getting better results. They lie lie lie , don't go to them."
2.5,1,"Long story, short result. One star is too many. NEVER GO HERE... Took a class A coach in for slide repair. Was asked to sign a work order that was open-ended (no amount listed, but agree to pay any and all charges). I refused and asked for a written estimate to be sent to our extended warranty company. This was done after more than 3 weeks of prodding. Estimate was approved as submitted, but wait; during the repair they found more labor was required for the repair and needed a few hundred more dollars from me. They are NOT customer oriented. I complained, and even spoke to a member of the owners family; they just don't care. The other reviews on Yelp would seem to corroborate that as well. This repair was a complete circus from the beginning. Beware...."
2.5,1,"Our first experience with LDLP of deer valley was when we wanted to trade in our old camper for a new one. The salesman wanted us to sign a credit run app before actually giving us the list price of the camper. I told him that I wasn't signing anything until I knew the price of the camper. He took that request to his manager- and his manager said ""you are the kind of people that would smile and that they would never see us again"" upon our request. Which makes you wonder what type of people are running the place. After hearing that from the salesman we decided to take our business else where. That was back in 2014. The reason why we picked LDLP was because it was close location wise for us (it was a 10 minute drive from us). After purchasing a 5th wheel at a different RV dealer we had an extended warranty on it which any sertified repair shop was allowed to work on our camper. So, seeing that LDLP was close to us we decided to take it to them for a couple repairs. Which 1 they could not fix. Here's the kicker! They have you sign a piece of paper that states that they are not responsible for any stolen or lost items. So, not knowing that this meant stuff that was already on and bolted down to the RV was included. What ended up missing was my flat screen TV! And LDLP shuged their shoulders and said ""sorry! You are the one that signed this paper, you're out a TV"". So before warned take your expensive stuff out so they won't steal it, or don't even bother handing over the keys to your camper and take your business else where. Guess I should have learned the first time. Will NEVER deal with them again!

2.5,1,"TERRIBLE service...... Everyone that looks at this review thinks..""well it's a dealership, nobody will leave happy."" WRONG! Please everybody looking into buying a trailer PLEASE take my review into consideration. This dealership is so unbelievably scandalous. The salesmen and everyone there are scam artists. My husband and I we're ready to walk out with a travel trailer and last minute, all of the sudden, things we're missing out of the trailer?? And the prices changes significantly? I was shocked. These people are by far unprofessional ... The salesman took a customer that had already bought a trailer, took the customer over to the trailer my husband and I we're looking at and basically put on a play and said hey this customer is looking into buying this trailer can you all get out so I can show him this trailer. Mind you this was all while we we're sitting in the trailer looking at it..... And had put a holding deposit on it. Unbelievable! Extremely unprofessional. Do not trust this company.  Then once we left to go eat lunch earl the salesman calls me back and says that they can not sell us the trailer that the original owner of the trailer is coming to pick it up..... Wow is all I have to say. So glad I didn't invest the money in that trailer . Watch out!

Let me also add my credit score is around 750 so is my husbands we own a business our selves. These people gave us the most terrible payment plan and interest rate for the credit we have. I've never felt like I was such an inconvenience to a company that had something to sell.... Im appalled."
2.5,1,Anything higher than 1 star on this place is a fake review.   Service department is messed up
2.5,1,"Not only do they not call and see if you are satisfied after you purchase something from them, they do not honor the warranty of the work that they do.  Steer clear of this place, plus they are very expensive for repairs!!!"
2.5,5,"We had a great experience buying our new '16 Viking popup camper at LDLP. Upfront pricing, no hidden costs, good helpful tips and advice. Smooth purchase and easy fun delivery.  But most of all terrific service. Thanks Tyler, Danny, Don, Amber, Big Mike, Big Big Mike and everybody else at Little Dealer Little Prices Deer Valley."
2.5,1,"So far I am very dis-pleased with the service department. I took my pop-up trailer in for repairs because I bought it at this exact location and my trailer won't crank up anymore . It has been there for two weeks and not a single part has been ordered yet, I don't know why they're dragging their feet on this repair."
2.5,1,"Took our pop-up camper in for inspection and minor maintenance.  Inspection was supposed to tell us everything wrong with the camper.  Almost $1k later, still don't know what was done!  Besides flushing the system, things that were supposed to be fix weren't, husband still found issues needing fixed NOR could they produce a report of everything they ""inspected"" with results.  At $120/hr labor, feels like a rip off.  Ps...they kept the camper for a week!  Sufficient amount of time to do a quality job."
2.5,1,What is it with this place? For two weeks I've been calling and emailing trying to get an appointment for service. You can't just talk to someone who can help you. There's only one person who handles your type of call and they are always busy so they transfer you to their voicemail. You leave countless messages and emails and nothing. Not a phone call returned or email replied. So finally the wife calls and demands to talk to someone and they say we can't get you in for least 23 days....... I literally just want the water pump looked at because it wont stop making noise and the oil changed on the generator. How they stay in business treating customers like this is beyond me.
2.5,5,"I have used the LDLP for only parts and knowledge. Michelle the parts girl is amazing. She is really nice and friendly and will help you any way possible. 

The service adviser Phillip is a gruff guy, you just need to understand it is his way but he is just as nice and helpful. 

The prices are right on par with everyone else and the selection is good. 

The Jaycos are great trailers I am on my 2nd. :)"
2.5,1,"I walked into this place because I'd seen somewhere online that they carried a particular brand I was looking for.  When I asked to see those at the reception desk, I was asked if I saw that on Craigslist.  Hunh?  Uh, no.

A sales rep approached and asked what I was looking for.  When I shared, he started disparaging that brand, which, in essence, was telling me I was not very smart, in his opinion, for looking at those trailers.  I took no names down, but have not one iota of intention to ever return or do business with this place.

I think I get why they have the uniforms they have, but I gotta say, the staff dressed the way they are enhances their image as a joke."
2.5,1,"If i were just rating warranty, Shane would get five stars. this is about sales, parts, and service. We bought our 2016 Jayco greyhawk 31ML back in June of 2015 from them. I noticed there was no grill box in closet and Jon Hennesse said they dont actually keep them in the rigs because people would steal them and they'll put it in the closet when we buy it. understandable. so we liked it for our family of five and bought it and a week later we came to pick it up and do a training walk through as this is our first RV. So during all this training I forgot to ask about the grill and didn't notice that no one put it in the closet. As we were packing it for the first time to leave to Washington I noticed that the grill wasn't in there. So i text Jon and he said he would take care of me when we got back from vacation in July. When we got back I was almost immediately injured and hospitalized and didnt remember to call them back till September. Well Jon no longer worked there and told me to get in touch with someone named KC  when I went there KC wasn't there or available and i left a message and it was never returned. I asked again when i had to get the shower fixed and the service people told me i needed to talk to Danny Graham but he was in a meeting and i had to leave a message which was never returned. I went there again a few weeks ago to get a price quote for a tow kit for my RV and jeep and again Danny was in a meeting and i had to leave a message. When i dropped the RV and Jeep off Danny was AGAIN in a meeting and i had to leave a message...... whatever ive lived without the grill for this long and this isn't what really made me rate them today. My quote LDLP gave me for the blue ox Tow Kit install for the RV and baseplate and invisibrake for the jeep was the cheapest in town (or so I thought). I saved even more money by buying some parts on amazon and LDLP price matched the others. 6/3 Zane called me to tell me my RV and jeep were ready. Went to pick it up and installer guy said to me ""hey you know with this set up you're going to want to get a brake system installed on that jeep"" I said ""um I paid to have invisibrake installed.""  the installer found the part I had already paid for in the back and said it would be done today. I asked Zane what happened and he didnt know so i said ""well i already paid for installation"" and he said ""there might be more now, because the installers dont work for free but i'll see what I can do, ill take responsibility."" so we left rvless and jeepless and he called me later that day and said the installer wont finish today and because it was Friday it would be ready on Monday. Monday comes and Zane called me to pick it up. we got there after work around 4pm and Zane had apparently left early because of a ""stubbed thumb"" is what I was told so i go to the counter and Shane who doesn't know anything about this and says my bill was 878.75 because it took him 8 hours when invisibrake website says 3 to 5! We're now 987.63 over the original quote! I had to pay it to get my vehicles back and they show me how to work this and then i get in the rv to drive it home and the gas tank WAS ON E! i dropped it off with just under a half tank. No one would help me get gas and they sent me to a fleet gas place up the road so i drove there in the RV but you need a special gas card to fill up there. so I stood there in the heat to look up where a gas station would be that was big enough for the rv AND the Jeep in tow and it was rush hour, deer valley road is stupid busy, this was my first time driving while towing something so this was INSANELY stressful. all the towing videos on youtube didn't prepare me for this.I don't know exactly where the problem lies with this company, maybe they don't know how to conduct business, lack of communication among employees, or maybe they just really like to rip off their customers. I cannot believe the owners, who give out bibles at the front door, would allow customers to be treated like this."
2.5,1,"I purchased a 33' toy hauler about 3 months ago for about $40K.  When I picked it up there were a few things that needed to be address.  Three months later and with my trailer sitting at Little Dealer for a total of over 4 weeks (while I pay the payments) they still don't have 1/2 of the issues fixed.  This past time I scheduled an appointment 3 weeks in advance for a Monday.  Then, dropped of the trailer for work.  Here it is Friday and they haven't touched it.  They boast about their ""great customer service"" but it is NOT TRUE AT ALL.  They seem to be good people, but obviously the people running the place don't have the first clue about what they are doing.  Further, when I picked up my ""brand new"" Jayco one of the window had a broken latch.  They told me that this is not covered under warranty.....  It was broken at the time of delivery; how can this be my responsibility.  Additionally, the fuel tank was full of plastic pieces that it pumps out into my equipment, the water tanks are not secure and move around under the trailer and the paint on the front of the trailer has already started to fade.  We really want to like these folks, but they couldn't try harder to make things difficult and inconvenient.  I am no longer a fan.... overall, a very terrible experience... and it continues...."
2.5,5,"Reasons to come here:

1.) You're hot
2.) You're bored
3.) You want to see what's the newest in ""modern convenience"" when RVing

But beware:

You just may find yourself the owner of an RV!

THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC ~ They have a terrific indoor showroom (aaaah, nighttime cool, campfire lit and BONUS! no mosquitoes!) 

The outdoor lot is extensive and most RVs are unlocked so you may browse at your leisure (that's what RVing is all about, right!? Leisure!)  Thankfully, there's no ""high pressure"" sales here and it seems the name lives up to itself ""Little Dealer, Little Prices."" Well, actually, the place isn't so little, but the prices do seem right in line.  

There's also a fine ""general store"" that will fix you up with most items you'll need for your new rig - including that special TP that won't clog the fancy hydrodynamics involved in those on-the-road lavs. 

Hmmm, I'll just leave it at that!"
2.5,5,"We are staying in one of the many RV parks nearby and have discovered that our RV needed maintenance several times. Not because of neglect, but just in general because we like to be on top of things.  We are part of a captive audience because Little Dealer Little Prices is the only RV service center nearest to us.  In four years we have been taking our motor home for warranty service and they have been extremely accommodating.  Easy appt times, reliable service and staff has gone out of their way to make us happy.  I could name them but it would be unfair since they all go out of their way for us.  We are happy and will continue to do business with these folks. Totally reliable in every way!"
2.5,4,"We are planning on getting a trailer for next summer - so thought we would stop in. 

This place is awesome - and the kids agree! The indoor showroom makes it great when it is 110 outside, and does give a rather good impression of being outside at night.

Most of the RV's outside are unlocked during the day - so you don't have to have a salesperson follow you around. But, the lot is pretty big, and trekking back to the building is a pain... may just want to have a salesperson follow you. That is if you can get one to swelter with you in 110+ degree weather -  :)

We were actually looking for a rental place (we want to rent first to make sure that RV'ing is right for us). While they do not rent, the lady that helped us pointed me to a few online places where we could rent the exact models that we were looking at.

I will be giving this place first shot when/if we decide to buy."
2.5,2,"Judge for yourself....

Very nice people BUT that doesn't make much of a difference when they nickle & dime you on your purchase.  Example:  they charge a $300  ""prep"" fee for all sales, including used. I've never heard of such a fee and this is not my first dealer purchase.   When I asked about the tandem battery setup that was there when I signed the deal on my used trailer, the tech said ""Oh,....you wanted that?  I took it off because we provide a new battery when you buy a trailer from us.""  Cool, I said.  He also gave me back the extra box & cables that he'd removed. When I asked for them back.   But I had to reinstall them...he didn't even offer. 
 
A week later I review my sales receipt and saw that they'd CHARGED ME $100 for the ""new battery they provide with every purchase!"" 

 AND they padded my service bill to make it look like they'd done more than they did!  REALLY DISAPPOINTING! 

 That's among several other things I had a problem with.  Oh, and the response to my complaints that I put into writing? An email explanation....one of those ""I""m sorry YOU misunderstood me""  types of apologies! So I waited a couple of weeks to see if that was all the response I'd get and sure enough that was it!   I'm amazed that they care so little about the outcome of their sales experiences!  I'll bet this review will cost them more than what it would have cost if they'd simply called me or met with me and said ""how can we make this right?""  Whatever you do, DON'T use their service dept and as far as sales, check everything and if your questions aren't answered to your satisfaction, there's lots of competition around Phoenix, so GO ELSEWHERE!"
2.5,1,"This is the final straw that makes me no longer want to bring my vehicles to dealers. Worst communication I've ever had, after 2 weeks of hearing nothing i called and got a person that sent me to someone else's voicemail where left my name and number. Then another week went by, i called again to have them tell me they have tried to contact me but it was my old number they had on file but i gave them my recent number in the voicemail and when i dropped off the vehicle would you not make sure that you have the most current contact information (i bought from them in 2015 but this was my first time servicing through them and last)."
2.5,5,"I went in to the store on Deer Valley today. Danny and his team were very helpful. I didn't buy anything, in fact he recommended I go with what I have because it was the best for my situation. The sales world needs more people like him. If I do need anything, I'll be sure to go see him."
2.5,5,Little Dealer is amazing! The sales staff was extremely knowledgeable in all aspects and really helped me find the perfect Motorhome for my husband and I. I love the family owned and operated part of this business as well as allowing my dog to be in their offices! Will be back and will tell all my friends and family about Little Dealer.
2.5,1,"We bought a trailer from them last Summer, and similar to other posts, the sales process was smooth and friendly. The service side is what we're now seeing as the downside to this place. We left an expensive item in the trailer on accident when taking it in for some recall work. It got stolen. It was in a place where you'd have to really be searching for something. Doors were locked when I dropped it off and when I picked it up. Seems like an inside job. Mike the service manager didn't really care. No empathy at all. Just kept mentioning that we signed a paper that takes the liability off them and that we should not have left the item in there in the first place. Found out that the trailer also had a busted exterior light that wasn't broke when I took it in there. No desire to make things right on their side for either issue. The service department in general has no sense of customer service or friendliness. We got the trailer through the Costco Auto program, and they're definitely being notified about how their partner treats people. We're also taking our future business to another dealer going forward and will gladly steer future RV buyers away from Little Dealer."
2.5,4,"i hav;e a toy hauler, and had an inverter and solar panels put on it.  It has not worked like it was supposed to, so i took it in to Phillip, a service adviser at Little Dealer.  He found that it had the wrong switch on it, and had been wired wrong.  He exchanged the correct part for the wrong one, had it wired correctly, and  had it back to me well within my time line.  I am very happy that my coach is now working as promised."
2.5,1,"To whom ever is concerned ... DO NOT buy from Little Dealers Little Prices!!! Bought a workmate top for a work truck and the craftsmanship is terrible. Was told they would remake some shelving and install later. Been 2 months. Also when it rains my equipment and parts get wet because top leaks. Obviously these are designed to keep you product and tools out of the elements, this one does not! I spoke to Service over at the Phoenix store where I bought the top and then we're going to call the manufacture to have the manufacture call me. So much for standing behind your product. Been two weeks since this top leaked and the manufacture and little dealers don't seem to be too concerned about my product getting wet. So do yourself a huge favor and don't buy anything from them because they will not uphold their 100% guaranteed satisfaction. They been dancing around taking care of my issues for two months.

2.5,5,My husband and I recently bought a new trailer here.. My only complaint after was we realized we were missing a few parts..after repeatedly trying to reach our salesperson to no avail we were contacted by Kelli Isley in the parts dept. She went above and beyond to get us the parts we needed. I cannot say enough good things about how much I appreciate her taking a very frustrating experience that was no fault of hers and making it right. She kept in contact with us until the situation was resolved! She even contacted us after to make sure we were completely satisfied. Thanks Kelli Isley - we will be using Little Dealer for all our parts needs!
2.5,1,"Just purchase a new 26ft trailer called about some warranty work due to sun damage (trailer is two months old) and was told 5 to 6 weeks to take a look at it. Couldn't believe it, not only that the lack of concern was pretty unsettling. This are the things you always find out after you spend $25k. Never do business with these guys complete bums and disrespectful. Ones they have your money you can wait six weeks to get an answer about your new trailer falling apart. Use a reputable dealer not little dealer littler service."
2.5,1,"Guy Named Kyle that works at Deer Valley location, had notification I was coming about 24hrs prior to arrival, but keep in mind its 115 degrees here right now and I said that I want the RV On and Running Cold prior to my arrival because I am 40 miles away, and the interior is 165 plus, and want to see everything before a deposit commitment. I said, I had a set back cannot make the appointment at 10 am and he responded that, "" Its OK we had someone come in later in the day, that wants to make an offer in the morning Anyway.""  Is, anyone finding this response Arrogant? This guy could offer something else in the same price to save a customer. Instead he says F U. I got someone else on this one. I am Irate on this response. He responds by Text no less... with the above and no, human contact. Take Advise... these sales guys are Aggressive and even the Finance, so please do not Drive off a lot without complete satisfaction or they will guilt you into buying because they DID SO MUCH FOR YOU. BULLSHIT!"
2.5,5,"Getting a popup truck camper ready for an upcoming trip. Discovered a propane hose leak, called Jose in service this is 2pm on a Saturday. Yay,  they have the part and can do the installation today! The tech Scott found a regulator problem also and completed the work before closing! I had an awesome experience and now ready to go camping. Thanks to Jose, Scott and the service manager !"
2.5,1,"I had read the bad reviews, however we purchased our first Toyhauler from this dealership in 2006 and had a good experience so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. Last weekend we stopped in and found a 2015 Attitude 28' Fifth wheel. The Salesperson called someone up  for the price and told us $21,900 firm. We thought about it and went back this morning to look at it again. The sales rep said we misunderstood, the price is $29,900 but is negotiable. She said we must've misunderstood due to her accent. It's hard to misunderstand between ""firm"" and ""negotiable"". I gave her my card and said to text or email me with a firm price. She calls me and said they got a deposit from someone else yesterday and as our conversation progressed said that there was a miscommunication on the price. I said thank you for your time and hung up. 2 seconds later I get this unprofessional text message from the rep. We won't be returning."
2.5,5,"""My Happy Place""   
     My Wife and I visited Little Dealer on Deer Valley 3 Months ago looking for a particular Class A.   
   We immediately loved the how we were treated there from the initial ""Hello and Welcome "" from the bubbly reseptionist.  Then we met "" Tim""  and the process became fun and informative!   Tim knows his stuff!    They did not have the unit we wanted but Tim, stayed on our quest anyway.   
    We found what we thought we wanted elsewhere ( Big Mistake! ) and purchased it, but knew right away we had bought the wrong unit.
     Long story short, and fast forward to 3 days ago we bought a travel trailer from our man ""Tim "" and became involved with all the other great people there at ""Little Dealer.  
     Amber handled all our final paperwork like a Pro,  without the ""Normal "" High pressure to buy things we didn't need. 
      Danny the General manager couldn't have been more helpful throughout the whole process.   He was very involved in making sure as Tim was in making sure we bought the right Trailer for our Tow vehicle.   It wasn't just about selling us something, it was about selling us the ""Right Trailer "", and I have to tell you that was Very refreshing indeed after being ""Sold "" the Wrong RV by other uncaring dealers. 
       The people after the Sale we're equally as great.  Mike and his team made sure I knew everything about my new Trailer and how it hooked up to my vehicle.   They didn't leave my safety in the future to chance.
        So I Highly recommend going to see ""Tim "" and all our new Friends at ""Little Dealer Little Prices"" , Our New Happy Place!!   Tell them "" Ron & Charlotte sent you!"
2.5,5,5 Stars all the way for Randy and the staff.  The units at this dealership are displayed in a camp like atmosphere that is unlike any other I have seen. The set up alone is worth a visit. The entire indoor air conditioned facility and friendly staff made my experience the very best.  Highly recommend the Deer Valley store and ask for Ranger Randy!  Can't say enough about how impressed I am with the whole operation.  All the Best!  JD
2.5,5,had a seriously damaged boat trailer with large boat on it.  Took several months to get all the parts but they did a fantastic job and were super friendly at reasonable prices.  They even dealt with the insurance company.  Unit was kept under cover and they kept me informed of progress.  We were out of town most of the time so the delay wasn't a factor.  Would do business with them again anytime.
2.5,4,"NO RATING Would be most appropriate. LITTLE DEALER-RIP OFF PRICES!! After spending almost $1000.00 on repairs, (water pump, slideout awning) I noticed I was grossly overcharged on my oil change. Prior to handing my vehicle over, I specifically asked the price on the oil change. I was told by the blonde lady behind the desk $85, I thought it was a little high considering I have my oil changed at Bell Ford and I only get charged $50 for this service. When I went to pick up my vehicle, MY CHARGE FOR THE OIL CHANGE WAS $230!!!  I was charged $85 for the oil change and then I was charged $150 for labor on the oil change. WOW!!
I talked to the service manager and he said he would deduct $30 off the labor. Then I was told that Bell Ford  didn't know how to change oil.  I never had a problem with Bell Ford ripping me off on a oil change. I have been coming to this place for the 4 years I have owned a motorhome  and they just lost a good customer. Over a $230 oil change.

UPDATE:  After going around and around, Jason the service manager decided to refund my $150, so my oil change was the $85 that I was originally told. But Jason told me I was never to come back to Little Dealer Little Prices again. I was a good client for 4 years, never complained, always thought they were a good, fair business until this. I know people make mistakes, but if this is the new norm for the young people in business to screw us over, make it right and then tell us never to come back, then we are all in trouble!!!

7/28/2017  UPDATE:  After Jason called me and we worked things out, I decided to give them 4 stars. Jason corrected the situation. He apologized for acting like a fool, he gave me back my $150 that I was overcharged.From now on, I will get their charges in writting prior to giving them authorization.  Prior to this incident, I had never had a problem with this business. Little Dealer always did a good job and I feel at a fair price. I will go back to them again."
2.5,4,"Thanks to Phillip Mayse in service my rv was repaired and serviced with only one glitch.  The first attempt to solve the problem didn't work.  When I returned to give them the opportunity to correct the error, I was impressed by the honest admission that the part should have been replaced in the first place.  I was treated fairly regarding price and as a compensation for having to return.  I trust Phillip to give me a straight story and a fair deal.  Tell him Buttercup sent ya.  He'll remember my dog."
2.5,5,"Ok, for anyone who has been in Cabelas, this place is similar. I could have hung around the big RV campsite with the real looking fireplaces and the motorcycles. Wow!!!! My son went crazy in there!! So I was immediately met by a man named Pat who was the first salesperson I saw and he introduced himself.  From then on all my questions were answered and I felt like Pat is the guy you always want as a salesperson because he is smart and remembers the details very well.  From then on I had no excuses! From a guy like me who is critical of sales (from buying cars) I was sure to see something I didn't like. However, I believe I gave my business to honest people. It was fun to hang out and buy an RV. Mike was the Manager there and we always met with a smile. I felt like he really helped my deal go through! Oh, my kids had the toy cars out in the salesroom and drove my wife crazy while we made the deal :) After that I was met with some other very professional individual's like Michelle who closed the deal on paper and made the buying experience in the finance room not feel like a heart attack!! I felt confident signing the papers because everything was explained to me from the beginning and the numbers were consistent (not like a lot of places). Trust is HUGE when buying something so this is important and I was able to trust them. After that Jeff showed me how to work the weight distribution hitch, sway bar and Steve did the brake control. Extra attention was paid to my vehicle and I felt confident driving a 30 ft. trailer home !!!! Pat, thanks for closing the deal on your day off. My family is very happy. Thanks everyone :)"
2.5,2,"Worked with Michael, experience started off great and spent several hours looking at campers. When finished and asking for work up pricing on a couple travel trailers he stated would only do two. So waited for call back which didn't receive and when contacting his number to ask about them he never called back. I have been to two of your dealerships and both times end up feeling your staff do not care for customers needs or to close the sale. Michael was very knowledgeable and fun to work with but never followed up with us regarding a purchase. Very disappointing will not recommend or go to little dealers little prices again."
2.5,1,"There service department is an absolute joke.  They don't return calls, they don't communicate.  They tell you that your repairs will be done by a certain date and then they aren't and they can't even call you to tell you or return your phone calls.
I can't speak for their sales department but their service department LACKS SERVICE! 
I am taking my complaint past leaving a review and am trying to reach a supervisor.  This has been one of the worst experiences I've had with any kind of repair/service company.  It really isn't that difficult to pick up a phone and communicate with a client."
4,5,"What a fantastic park located in a pretty wooded setting away from all the crazy rush of Charlotte - But still close enough to all your amenities - Shopping, Dining etc. Office staff is super friendly and eager to help - Great dog park and pet friendly - Owners work hard to keep the place up and clean - Nice friendly people that stay here too - not noisy at all - Laundry and Bath facilities also -  Definitely worth the stop by!"
4,4,"Nice clean park, friendly staff! Gravel sites, which we like. No ant piles! Yay! Good for pets.  50 amp, full hook ups, we had a nice pull thru! Good location, close to restaurants and shops. Couldn't get satellite, tree in the way. Did not see a pool. They only have basic cable, reason for 4 stars, normally campgrounds with cable, would have more channels, not just basic. Would stay here again."
4,5,The park is very clean and I found our location to be nice. The bathhouse is well situated and clean.   I find it to be very quiet.  Everyone we have met has been very nice. There are several dogs here and they are all quiet.  I really like the place.  Our internet and cable are fitting our needs.  We are next to one of the roads and have no complaints about the traffic or noise.   I love it here.  I am very comfortable with my daughter residing here.  Would recommend it to everyone who camps. This is such a oasis of trees and serenity hidden here among all of the housing nearby.  The restaurant selection is awesome and we will visit our daughter again to enjoy all this facility has to offer.
4,5,"There is the KOA and this campground in this location. Crown cove definitely has it right! The girls that work in the office are incredible! It's privately owned and you can tell! Very welcoming! Beautiful sites, nice and shaded, and very quiet! Perfect place to hang out. If you have kids the KOA would probably be better for them, but warning, they are lacking in maintenance and hospitality."
4,5,"Highly recommend.  I have been here a month and plan to stay long term.  No problems whatsoever.  Clean and well maintained grounds. The staff in the office is excellent.  Great location. Can't think of anything negative to say. I am enjoying my stay and will be here for a long time, I hope!"
4,2,"It's a little tight for pulling in with a big rig. 
The internet doesn't work.
My att service here is only 2 bars. Oh well
Coming in these folks knew I was staying 3 weeks. They call today to tell me I will have to move because they scheduled someone to come to my spot. There are 3 open spots the same size. 
They also won't take a delivery or tell the delivery person where to deliver. They don't hold it for you they have it returned.
This is not a place to stay for a couple of weeks. It is 95% full time."
4,3,"It was Caitlyn's excellent customer service us what won our decision to stay here over the other parks in the area . She was so polite, cheerful, helpful and accommodating... which is a lot more than I can say about her supervisor. 

After we made 3 day in advance reservations and settled in the first day our greetings from the park manager, Emily, were literally ""I would not have rented the space to you bc your hitched car/trailer is too long (28')"" and then she made excuses of ""clearances"" (it clears lower than our rig at 13') and was no closer to our site than the already sardine-like packed house. She said it could be a hazard for safety or rescue vehicles to get in and save lives (it was parked in a designated concrete parking spot, not looming in front of our door or any others, for that matter). On the contrary, there's several acres of unoccupied land on the site where new construction will eventually take place... plenty enough for 100 extra storage of trailers 30' long or more on an actual concrete parking lot adjacent to the sardine packed lots. There's plenty of room. 

Then she proceeded to berate the sweet Caitlyn, who's lovely sales pitch and soft personality sold me the park in the first place. I told her that she should be so lucky to have such a well mannered and happy employee, and to please not reprimand her for permitting our stay. Emily literally made me feel completely unwanted and scolded me like a nagging mother, when I had done nothing wrong or deliberate to deceive the park rules... it was no where in the booklet that a car carrier/trailer was not permitted. In fact, others have smaller trailers right on their site!!! After 3-4 times of her repeating herself, I stopped her saying, ""it sounds like we are getting off on the wrong track"" of which she agreed bc the conversation started to get heated. I was simply asking for a solution and she continued scolding me when it was not clear where we were supposed to park in the first place... repeatedly telling me what I ""can not do."" I did let them know we had a 28' pull behind trailer that contained our vehicles during the reservation. There's clearly a control issue, or she doesn't train her staff well. A normal response would have been, ""Mrs. Webster-Andrews, I hate to bother you since your already nicely settled. I'm sorry that we need to ask you to move your enclosed trailer to a different location on the lot... I'll tell you where we can accommodate you. Please let me know when it's a good time to do this today! Thank you! ""

I met other lovely park campers (active couples in their 40's) with fur baby fever just as we have. The park itself is tight and jammed packed, but kept clean and tidy. The surrounding neighborhood is upscale,  which is surprising for a campground area. I was able to enjoy the local area of Ballentyne, NC and go to my regular workouts at OrangeTheory, eat healthy foods in the area and still be in a campsite! How cool! 

Although we were excited to park on a concrete pad, we are located at the bottom of a graded hill were there was waterline repair being conducted during our stay... so are were the unhappy recipients  of a river of rich red clay/dirt flooding our site (driveway, grass, rocks) so now our white Jeep is covered in red clay, Harley is a mess, and our rig as well as our shoes, interior floors and all our fur babies feet... tracked into our bed... . It is a nightmare wiping ever paw and piling dirty shoes on the front steps and constant sweeping. We don't normally choose dirt or gravel locations for this very reason. To rectify the situation the supervisor sent their maintenance crew the next day to spray down my mats and the 1/2 thick mud pile at my door. 

Maintenance was pretty friendly. The site was nice, but I stood in a hidden red ant pile on the hot gray gravel in flip flops while taking my pups potty at the backside of my RV... it was misery for the moment and left me with nearly 20 bites. Additionally, the park also has a bike path that runs along the creak, it was a nice ride to free our DANE puppy so she could run a bit unrestricted. We saw plenty of dear! 

The dog park was nice and clean. Only one silver hair was more concerned about preaching rules to me at the dog potty (where she was with her foaming 150 lb dog and Chihuahua) that she didn't concern herself with neighborly conduct like a reaction to control her dog so we could enter. Instead of her pulling her unruly dogs together to allow us in the gate, she berated me for letting my big dogs off the leash outside the fence so they could potty bc she wouldn't permit is to enter. It was just plain rude.

Overall, I would have given the site a 5 star rating, but these two incidences made us feel completely uncomfortable... and we'd likely consider going to the nearby KOA (with all the accommodations) instead."
2,1,Be ready to wait in line when you come and get parts at this place. Average wait time is around 30 mins just to get help!!
2,1,"Horrible, I will never return. My Onan generator stopped working. Come to find out the carb was gummed up due to sitting too long. The carb is no longer serviceable. So I spent $400 on a new carb with the gaskets needed. I installed myself. I'm not a mechanic but I am pretty handy. Took me about 30 minutes. The generator worked the next 2 times but stopped working after that. I obviously did something wrong installing it. I thought. So I make an appointment, next available was 2 weeks away. I bring the 5th wheel to them. They have it for 3 days before even looking at it and tell me I installed the carb incorrectly. They couldn't explain how I installed it incorrectly. They wanted $1300 to install a new carb even though mine was new. They quoted 3.5 hours of labor. I stated I would just come pick up the trailer and paid them $260 for a diagnostic. When I brought it home I had a mechanic friend look at it for me. Come to find out the whole problem was the gasket that the parts counter sold me was incorrect. Put the correct gasket on and it works like a champ. They will never get another dime from me. I feel like I was stolen from paying them the $260 diagnostics fee. And 3 weeks wasted."
2,1,"Awful, just awful. Had our rv since last Monday (8 days). Told us Friday that the part wouldn't be in until Monday. Then sent us an email stating the part would SHIP Tuesday (today) and would arrive Wednesday.  Meanwhile we are stranded here."
2,1,"run  ,run  away   terrible   shop service  and  customer  service ,  very  cheap/frugal   place  , stay  away  from  bert m. , very  hard  to  get  anybody  on  the  phone"
2,5,Came in to get some work done. Front desk was polite and friendly helped me where I needed to go. Offered complimentary popcorn water and coffee. Staff was friendly and help.
4.5,5,"Just finishing a long weekend visiting friends who own a couple of homes here. I am 42 and child free and I prefer going places that are also largely child free. Its the end of the season and out of 1750 (or so homes), only 300 are occupied permanently year round and some people have already taken off to their permanent homes. I love how the pools have child free hours and how the rules are observed/obeyed by everyone. There is so much to do it was almost overwhelming. There are lessons for all the activities and a weekly schedule that tells you when they are. Almost all of the facilities (including the pool and hot tubs) are 24 hours. Everything is clean and well maintained and everyone was so welcoming and friendly. We live in Southern California, so would have no reason to winter or buy here, but we are already looking forward to when we can next visit!"
4.5,5,"We have come to venture out since we were kids. Now on the third generation of owners. One of the only parks in mesa where you can own your land and control the cost of yearly dues. There are so many fun things to do. Our children who range in age all love to come here. It's safe, updated, beautiful, clean and super friendly. We love love love this park. Condo fees are the cheapest In The area because we are one of the only parks in the area where people own their land. We vote on projects and improvements. I love that the people here largely want to improve the park and it is in nicer shape then when we came as kids. The desire of most here is that our park continues to update facilities and continues to improve amenities so that people want to come. We have had family members and friends who lived in other parks all move to Venture out because the park itself is happier, friendlier and way less expensive."
4.5,3,"The largest most sophisticated park-model RV park in Arizona. Many amenities, well maintained. Two pools, tennis, four hot tubs, gym, Bocce, tennis, laundry, arts-crafts, entertainment, lots of clubs, full hook-ups. This park isn't cheap either. 

The good news is inside VO there is no world-wide economic depression! Let's party like it's 1929! Let the booze and the money flow! 

Cons: 
Internet: The park is stuck in the 1990s as far as internet service goes. With Centurylink being the only wired choice you'll be lucky to get 190kbps like 1999 grade speed. But we all know the end of that story... that internet thing will never catch on, so why invest in it? The park manager promised a park-wide system installed back in October but it never came into reality which is typical outcome with VO 'management.' If you want even mediocre service you will need to get a 4G hotspot from TMobile or Verizon. 
Please note this about Centurylink internet service: the only web pages that will come to you at the advertised speed are the speed test web sites, all other web pages are throttled back to nearly dial-up speed. (if you read their terms of service they do admit this is corp policy). Fiber optic? Sure, but not to your home. 

A comment in the park manager's newsletter stated the Condo Board was intending to replace the bar code sticker vehicle access at the main gate and back gate in place of using your chipped ID badge to open the gates. The reason they favor this is because they want to come down hard on people behind on their condo fees or if they just don't like you, to cut owners off from everything possible, immediately. You would be restricted to waiting in line at the contractor access gate if you badge was lost or failed or a day late on your condo fees or if they just want to get your attention. I suspect their intent here is to also reduce the security staff if they think they can have tighter access on the gates. But don't be fooled the actual motivation here is punitive. They will also add badge access to the west pool and eventually to other facilities: tennis, bocce, hobby buildings, etc. The more popular the facility the more likely they are to add badge access. 

Keep in mind that RFID badge access is designed to LIMIT access. The only reason to implement technology like this is to restrict access. So the condo board is spending our money to impede or block access to our properties. This will not improve security or enhance property values. This demonstrates how the owners are seen as the enemy of the condo board. The board should focus on improving our sinking property values or make living at Venture Out more desirable, sellable. 

You can buy an RFID card copier on Amazon for $22! and they come with blank cards and fobs. These are NOT secure and are simple to copy. All you need to do is come near someone's card (like in the grocery store aisle) to copy it, and the il-informed condo board wants to base gate security in this unsecure technology? This shows you how totally out of touch with technology and reality the condo board is. (search on amazon.com: RFID Copier)

Staff: Many staff members (not all) treat the residents as if they are little slaves to be ruled over. Some VO employees are very arrogant and disrespectful of the true owners of VO. There was a sign over the compressed air hose near RV parking that read: 'employees only' which means I have to pay for it but I cannot use it. This was a good example of the overall attitude in the park. This is also a good example of why we need to replace the existing management from the top down.

Prospective buyers: please note that ALL proposed building projects which are billed to each property owner are ALWAYS voted YES. So calculate that into your expense estimates, add about $120 a month to your condo fees for building projects, like the coming executive office building so our incompetent park management can live like the lords they truly think they are. It will end up being two stories tall so they can truly look down upon us.

Did you notice with the upgraded park web  page the newsletters are gone from public view. Wanna bet why that happened? Does it happen to be related to all the dumb stuff the Queen puts in the newsletter?

Now, to see the newsletters you need to sign-in (they don't want the public seeing the truth). The problem with signing-in is you need to give them your email address, the problem with that is then you get their insulting emails, my favorite is: 'It's going to be very hot today.' Never mind that is our normal weather here, never mind it's been getting hot here in the desert for hundreds of thousands of years now, but suddenly management thinks it's an emergency requiring warning emails. 115 degrees! Wow, sure glad they warned me, what a shocker! Yesterday, 114 but today, one degree hotter and they think I'd too stupid to stay up on our normal weather. This is further evidence of the arrogance of management here."
4,5,"I called others, but non called me back.    I checked Yelp and called Fix-My-RV, we made an apt when I would be home, he was right on time.   He fixed everything that needed to be done.  He had to order a new lock, when it came in he called me and come right over.  I am thrilled.  He also adjust my door for me.  

I have been paying, what I felt was to much to have work done on my RV, in the past and I brought it to them.  He was very reasonable, for time spent, work done, and coming to me.  I will be using his service again if I need more work done."
4,5,Jeff delivers quality customer service & clearly knows what to do. I'd recommend him to everyone & will certainly call him again if needed.
4,5,"Jeff was awesome. I had problems with two awnings. Since we live and travel in our motorhome it can be difficult to have the time in one place to diagnose order parts and repair before it is time to move on. I had three times before called other Repair places from Texas to Arizona. Each time the Repair people ordered parts came out to install and could not get the Repair done. They just left me high and dry. One guy even damaged my coach with a dent in the slide out. 

Jeff came by ordered correct parts,scheduled the install, and repaired both awnings perfectly. He knows what he is doing. You will be sorry if you call anyone else."
4,5,"Our Rv was stored in Canada for the past 3 years. After we brought it back here to AZ, we spent big $$ to have it serviced and inspected. My husband insisted upon having the Rv repaired at the dealer we originally bought it from. In short, big mistake and very bad yelp reviews. After spending big $$ and still not repaired right, I read yelp reviews on other Rv repair places. We contacted Fix My RV a few days ago to inspect and repair a propane leak ( that should have been caught by the un-named place). My husband is very happy with Fix-My-RV. The repairman found the leak and repaired it plus some other things that the other repairer did not address. Fix My RV arrived on time. Absolutely competent. He commented that in AZ, RV repairers do not need to be certified and often are not. The Fix My Rv is certified repairman. We will continue to use them."
4,5,"We have found Jeff to be an excellent RV technician. Before tackling a problem he first listens and thoroughly understands the issue and then proceeds in an organized manner to correct it. He is prompt and does not rush through the appointment. His work for us included working on our air conditioning, Hydro hot, and electric toilet. He also replaced our chassis batteries for us. On top of his professionalism, we found Jeff to be personable and friendly. His pricing is reasonable and fair. It has been a pleasure dealing with him and we will call on him again."
4,5,"Fix-My-RV is an outstanding service.  Jeff, himself, (and others), describe him as highly detail-oriented.  This is so true, and it translates into extra service and extra safety for his clients.  After seeing several reviews, I called Jeff and asked him about batteries, since my electrical system was not working on my 2011 Coachmen Freelander.  Jeff gave me a full understanding of how the electrical system and ""house"" batteries work and interact, as well as the many options I had based on my style of camping.  I ended up getting totally different batteries than I had assumed I would get, and am convinced that this setup is far superior to those I was planning to get.  Jeff also picked up my batteries from his distributor, since we needed them in a hurry.  Now, he is custom making a battery clamp for my battery compartment.

When Jeff was at my home installing the batteries, he noted the terrible condition of my tires....dangerous, really!  He also went on top of my RV to inspect the solar panel we had installed earlier.  I learned a tremendous amount from Jeff, and feel he clearly has his clients' best interests in mind. He always calls back when he says he will.  He's a very knowledgeable, conscientious, friendly and skilled individual.  I plan to use him for all of my future RV-related work.  He's the ""Real Deal"" for sure!!"
4,5,"He has very reasonable rates and know what he's doing.  Although the repair only took a few minutes, when you consider how much time and effort it would have taken for me to take my RV into the dealership, the service call fee was a real bargain!

I would definitely use again!  Highly recommend."
4,5,"While living in Indianapolis, IN, we hired Jeff to conduct a pre-purchase inspection on an RV we were purchasing in Phoenix, AZ.  He completed the inspection, providing a report of his findings, on the date and time he promised.  After reviewing the report and speaking with him about some of his findings, we hired him to complete some minor repairs prior to our driving the RV back to Indianapolis.  Jeff showed up for the 2nd appointment on time.  He was courteous, professional and was happy to answer the questions we had concerning our new RV.  Jeff was highly recommended on several RV users forums, and we were not disappointed.  We would highly recommend Jeff for any work that might be needed on your RV.  If we find ourselves back in the Phoenix area in the future, we will definitely give him a call if we need any repair work done on our RV."
4,5,"Fix my RV did a great job on our older Motorhome.  We needed a new AC unit in the back and had to upgrade the thermostat to be able to talk to the older AC unit in the front.  Lots of unknowns ran into(old wiring, custom ducting, etc), but Fix My RV held to the estimate with no additional charges to fix all the items related to the age of our Motorhome.  Great Service!"
4,1,"As full time RVers, we are very familiar with motorhome maintenance, repair requirements & costs.   We contacted Jeff to replace our patio awning.  After 3 weeks of waiting,  phone calls & emails from us,  thinking that he's taking action to resolve our issue,  he told us ""he didn't have time to do the job"".  He should have said this at our first meeting.   I believe the real reason is that altho' he saw the $$ he could make from our job,  he isn't really capable of doing work of this magnitude.  Don't waste your time with him.  Go to someone who can actually get your job done."
4,1,"I called near the end of June and got a message dated May 8th that they would return on July 9th. I'm never going to use a repair service that takes two months off, I'm glad I did not call on May 7th."
4,1,"I called Jeff the other day, and he never called me back. Not a great example of Customer Service. i'd say."
4,5,Called Jeff and he came the  next day. Had a bad solenoid and he replaced it. Very personable man and honest too. Charged me a fair price for his work and parts. I would definitely recommend him to anyone for RV repairs! Great experience after dealing with all the crooks that are out there!
1.5,1,"Thia was the fourth time we have rented an RV in North America and certainly the most disappointing experience we have had. The depot was understaffed with only one person trying to help customers returning vehicles and collecting them. However, we were most irritated by the standard of the RV we were given. Mould in cupboards and on the shower curtain, dirty floors, mucky bathroom facilities and a general lack of cleanliness. Both the interior and exterior were damaged not to mention a damaged door lock where the van had bennbroken into. Just to round things off nicely the engine light came on after a few days causing us to have an anxious time on the road. On our return we were offered $100 in settlement for our inconvenience.! 
Cruise Canada have failed to respond to our  emails but the Bolton branch have basically said hard luck! Not an experience to be recommended."
1.5,2,"BEWARE  - I rented a 19 ft RV from the Calgary office late Sept 2016. To start with, gas tank was 1/3 full. That was annoying, but minor. What wasn't a minor annoyance was my carbon monoxide detector shrieking me awake at 3AM my first night, 5 hours after starting the gas furnace. I called traveller assistance and reset the detector, then hard reset it by pulling the fuse for 5 minutes, and then settled down for the night. Same thing happened next night (my neighbors were not happy). I called again, options were to 1) buy a new detector  and/or 2) buy an electric heater. Of course, I was in Banff over a weekend - no hardware store open. So, I ended up bundling up in my (summer) sleeping bag and waking up from the cold every few hours to run the heater for a few minutes while the fuse for the detector was pulled out (not smart, I know). Possible this was a bad detector, but you can't smell CO, so it seems nutty to ignore it all night long. Probably I was the 1st person to use the furnace this season? You could see a lot of yellow, not blue, flame - so I'm pretty sure that means it wasn't burning properly, and it took hours to alarm - seems like a bad detector would go off right away.
Some observations:
1) This shouldn't happen - a defective furnace leaking carbon monoxide can kill you. This should be maintained/checked before I rent the RV.
2) Why have gas heat? The Cruise Canada RV website doesn't tell you this size RV (19ft) HAS NO GENERATOR! So the furnace (fan) can only run 2 hours on the auxiliary battery - so you HAVE to be hooked up to an electrical outlet at a campsite to run heat overnight. Why not just use an electric heater and avoid the propane/CO issue?

They did knock a day's rental off for my near death experience and several nights of poor sleep, but I wouldn't repeat this adventure."
1.5,1,"I'll be honest, our hiring of an RV from Cruise Canada is a story in parts. This is our departure story. We hired our RV from an independent party, who provided us with instructions for the collection of our RV, including the restriction that we could not pick it up on the day of arrival into Canada, being that we were travelling internationally. Fair enough, that makes sense, falling asleep at the wheel of a 24ft vehicle travelling at speed would be disastrous for anyone. It also stated that we must call the depot 24hrs in advance of our reservation, so we did this as well. When we did so, we were greeted with the most bemused response of 'why? your reservation is tomorrow.' err, because we were told to? Nevermind. 

The following day, we are scratching our heads, trying to figure out out to get to the depot. On our tablet, we were struggling to find the depot location, but eventually located it, but the website comes with no instructions for how to get to the depot. The email we received includes tdriving instructions, but, given that we are hiring an RV, it would seem rather odd to hire a car as well? 

That was not the only odd part. So, with no details on the Cruise Canada website, we tried to call the depot to get some advice from the people there on how to get to Bolton from downtown Toronto, only to be greeted with 'how would I know that?'. Last time I checked, YOU ARE A TRAVEL COMPANY. Any other vehicle hire company includes details on how to get to a location, not a clueless answer. 

After arriving, we were a bit confused to be charged $700 dollars in tax. When we asked the girl serving us, she hadn't got a clue why, walked about a foot to her manager who, very clearly within earshot, said 'tell them it's tax, they have to pay it'. She walked a foot back, to repeat what he had said - no worries dear, 'they' heard good and fine the first time round. A lesson in manners would be recommended - nay, 3 or 4.

From there, it went from bad to worse. When we left the depot (after $130 taxi fare, thanks for picking somewhere completely out of the way!), we discovered that the hot water wasn't working, and neither were the electricals. Upon some investigation, my heating engineer partner eventually located the heater, only to find it hadn't even been commissioned i.e. when we switched the hot water on, the hot water tank was being heated while empty, as the water hadn't been switched on. This, by the way, was all behind sealed units that technically we were not supposed to access. The manual that came with the RV was useless, as the instructions didn't match the unit we had. I'll get onto that shortly. Whilst investigating, we tried to call the Travellers Assistance, got cut off and never heard from them again (correction, not til we called them back only to be told that they hadn't got round to calling as they were too busy). We also tried to contact the depot to talk to the mechanic who guided us around the van in the first place, only to be told that the receptionist was too busy to talk to us. Over an hour later, the manager calls us back (not the mechanic, as requested) - rather late in my book, considering we had been stuck on the side of the highway at the time all of this was happening. When told we had resolved the problems, we were basically informed that we must have misunderstood what we were told:

1) the van was ready to go (no, it really wasn't - I will also note the kits we paid for on top of the rental were not in the van and had to be fetched after we did a quick check)
2) there was an inverter in the system that would mean the electrics would work without a shoreline - nope, no inverter. I can't make inverter up, I don't even know what one is, but I was told very clearly that I had one. 

Oh yeah and forget an apology, that wouldn't be necessary as it was a miscommuncation. Right. 

Cruise Canada documentation is nothing but poor - one manual for their whole fleet of RVs, irrespective of size. The information in it doesn't correspond - which is a little distrubing when you get to the list of fines for damaged or missing items - especially when the kits you are supplied with don't correspond with the manual. We didn't get a checklist when we left Toronto, and naturally freaked out when seeing that we would be fined for items we never had in the first place.

So yeah - Cruise Canada (Toronto), you get one star because you had a nice mechanic who, despite feeding us inaccurate info about our vehicle was the best part of the depot. Your staff are otherwise rude and clueless and there is no danger of a chance we would hire an RV from you again."
1,1,"Reserved a Budget truck weeks in advance. I showed up at 8am to learn they have NO trucks on hand-there was also another gentleman there to get a truck he reserved. The guy working was very friendly and hooked us up with a truck each from the Moon TWP location. The truck I have is filthy, has a cracked windshield, has cigarettes in the ash tray and is infested with ants. The back (cargo area) was never cleaned, the windshield has something all over the INSIDE and seems to have never been cleaned. I am driving across the country in this truck, and I'm not sure how much further I will make it. I also only need the truck for 3 days and was told it's a package and I must pay for 6 days even if I turn it in early! Budget Truck rentals are a JOKE."
1,1,"Should've checked Yelp first! Thought we rented a truck - only to find they didn't have one on the day of our move...or any other time, either. Frustrating experience with poor customer service."
1,1,"Placed a reservation for a Budget truck online. On the Budget reservation website, it listed Saturday hours here as being 8am-noon. On the front door of Miley the posted hours state it's open until 4pm on Saturdays. I arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday to pick up my reserved truck and no one was working! The doors were locked. No one answered when I picked up the phone, and I couldn't leave a message. I had to scramble to find a truck to rent somewhere else as I needed it that day."
1,1,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH

They do not care about you or your business. They will not make something right or even try. Man behind the counter can't even get up off his stool to help you.

I requested a truck on 7/12 for 7/16. When I got to Miley Truck Rental in Carnegie, I handed the man my conf. page. He responded, ""I can tell you right now, I don't have any trucks."" I asked where they were, and he said looks like there's one in Monroeville.

I asked him why it was in Monroeville, and he said ""I don't know."" So I pressed, can you get a truck here? Why isn't there one here? All he could say was ""there's one in Monroeville."" He didn't offer to get off his stool and help,  to call Monroeville to make sure it's there, to make up for the difference, or anything. I would be embarrassed to be affiliated with him.

After going to my car and calling other companies, no trucks were available. I called the Monroeville location, and the rep told me she had a 12 ft truck. I drove there. The rep in Monroeville was very helpful and gave me a much better impression of your company than the man at Miley.

I incurred $136 in additional fees, charges, gas money, missed mover time, etc. due to this extremely unprofessional experience."
1,1,"I reserved a 16' box truck for the weekend so that I could move from Sheridan to Crafton. I show up at the pick up time and, NO TRUCK. Not just my truck, they had no trucks at all. 

The man attempting to help me was unapologetic and seemed more interested in talking about how he had to run the place solo with his buddy who was in the shop.

I would look into renting a truck from anywhere else but here."
1,1,"I made a reservation for a moving truck well in advance. When I showed up... NO TRUCKS! WTF? DO NOT rent a truck here! Try ANYWHERE else. They took the reservation, but did not keep the reservation, useless in the extreme. As if moving is not stressful enough!"
1,1,Do NOT use this place. I should have read previous reviews first. NO TRUCKS available after receiving my confirmation email the day before!! And the guy working there does not care!! He just sat there and blamed Budget and sorted through his mail. I called U haul from the lobby and was able to get a truck. He didn't care that he was losing business!!
1,1,"WORST customer service ever. This place completely ripped me off. I dropped my car for inspection on a Monday after making an appointment few days prior to the weekend. 
They took my car and the mutual understanding was for my car to be fixed within a day. 
They kept lying and pushing me ""INTENTIONALLY"" twice a day and they were extremely rude. 
I did not take my car until Friday at 4 PM (SINCE MONDAY - FOR INSPECTION ONLY). 
Even after I took my car with new inspection stickers, my car was not fixed at all. 
THEY CHARGED ME ALMOST A $1,000 FOR BU*&%$IT STICKER. That's not even legal, I'M GONNA SUE THIS PLACE!!"
1,1,"Dropped off my vehicle for state inspection and was told the service will be completed in the morning of the next day. Called them the next morning, and was told that the mechanics are working on something else and they will inspect my vehicle before noon. I waited till noon and called, and was told that the mechanics are working on something else and they will inspect my vehicle before 3 pm. Waited and called at 4 pm, and was told that the mechanics are working on something else and they will inspect my vehicle one day later. Tried to reason with them, rudely they refused to inspect my vehicle and asked me to pick it up. I sent my vehicle there for inspection as I have been trying to sell it and my buyer is waiting for the inspection to be completed so we can finish the transaction. Telling that the inspection can be completed whiling not doing anything and keeping me waiting has critically affected my sales. This is an awful place."
1.5,1,"If you need your RV repaired I suggest you find another place. Worst service department with  which I've done business. But I don't blame the service people. I blame management. They don't give their employees the tools to give good customer service. That's sad because the service people take the brunt of the complaints. 

I made an appointment, why they take appointments is a mystery to me, for warranty work. I dropped the unit off and two weeks later they call to ask when I am bringing the unit in so they could make the repairs. They didn't know the unit was in their lot. They then kept the unit another two weeks, and this is in January by the way, so now we are up to one month since I dropped the RV off. I emailed them and complained and told them I wanted it fixed. I didn't want my RV in their lot all this time. It was only then that they decided to get on it and make the repairs. Today I went to pick my RV up and they didn't have it pulled off the hill where they keep them and told me they would have someone pull it around. I waited 35 mins before I confronted them on this and expressed my displeasure that they were wasting my time. I will never take my RV there for repairs again and suggest that others find a repair shop with better service. 

Oh and I would like to add my name to the list of people who took their coach in only to find out that the work was in fact not completed."
1.5,1,"They have the WORST service customer service of ANY business I've dealt with. Our camper had MINOR issues (a new 2015) and was in service for a month. When we were going through JUST AN APPOINTMENT, we couldn't make one because the woman (Brenda???) didn't understand what we meant. ??? So finally, it's ""done,"" and they call us to pick it up. It WASN'T done, and not only did they NOT give us a print out of what was done, they said that the part was never in to fix it (it was just a VENT COVERING! A VENT COVERING! take one off the lot and replace it!). They said they winterized it. But I don't have an answer about any of the other issues. Why not? Because a month later, NO RETURNED PHONE CALLS, no mailings of an invoice, nothing. We are supposed to be camping next weekend. We took it in JANUARY! 

We will NEVER, EVER buy from Tom Johnson or Camping World again. I suggest no one else do the same. It's a shame, because we bought a truck and can definitely consider upgrading! Go somewhere else, people."
1.5,4,"Bought a pop up camper here. Did most of it via email, then came on in to finish up. Ben was my sales guy, he was very professional and I got a deal I was happy with. They took the time to show me all the features, and during the walk through, found a defective part. The service guys were very helpful and got it repaired quickly and I was on my way."
1.5,1,"I did get a good deal on an RV but the RV had some damage above the steps into the RV. Someone had peeled off the plastic scuff protector. I bought it Thanksgiving weekend and went back the following week to make an appointment. They said I could bring it back in next week but that there were 900 RV's ahead of mine. I could park it on the top of the hill and they would get to it when they could. I didn't care to permanently park my RV there. I asked if they could call when they were ready to do it. I could be there in 10 minutes. That was not an option.There was also some wiring hanging from the back drivers side. . You can see where they taped it up to get by. The mattress above the cab needs replaced since it wasn't sewn next to the zipper. I dropped it into a Tractor Trailer shop 2 days ago and had the damage painted. They also fixed the wiring problem. I am sure I have a better paint job than I would have received from Tom Johnson anyway. Of course, it is not paid for under warranty even though the shop is authorized to do the warranty for Freighliner, Kidron and Morgan truck bodies. Try to call them for anything and you will get an answering machine and never a call back. You might be able to talk to someone about buying an RV but no one else! I am still waiting for my plates for my class C. The temporary one expires tomorrow."
1.5,1,"We purchased a faulty rv from this business. not only do they not stand by their product their customer service is so poor that we still have not received call backs.

If you're going to make such a large investment I suggest you do not make it at Tom Johnson camping center"
1.5,1,"If I could give zero stars I would. Horrendous customer service. We just left and will never return to make a purchase. My husband, myself ( 7 months pregnant) a toddler, and two small children were completely ignored by every individual there. We walked around for about an hour and not once, were we offered a ride in the golf carts nor was anyone there to answer any of our questions. When we finally were able to flag someone down for a ride up the street to view more trailers, he quickly left us there to walk back.  Never will we give our business to a company where woman and children are so blatantly ignored and disregarded."
1.5,1,"Customer service is awful. From starting with getting through on the phone to making an appointment. We had our travel trailer there for a simple repair no update and took over a month to get It back, then when we got it back they didn't even fix the problem. Avoid them at all cost!"
1.5,1,"Wish I had the option of leaving 0 stars. Worst experience I have had. And it wasn't the first time we had unsatisfactory work.  Took our 5th Wheel in for some simple repairs that we pointed out and wrote down in detail, one of which was to repair the shower faucet, an upgraded toilet and their 45 point inspection they talked us in to in order to be sure everything was up to snuff for our month long Christmas trip to see family. They charged us $2000.00 to replace the canopy and install a new toilet and when we got the unit home and ready to leave for our trip found the shower plumbing hanging out of the shower stall wall.  We stupidly assumed they did what they said they did and we never opened the shower stall to look at it.  There were numerous things on OUR list to repair and ended up having to do them ourselves. We made many many calls to the service manager in charge of our unit and never talked to her in person. Always a voice message. We are so disappointed and mad and all we can do is warn others that if you want service don't go to Tom Johnson. We are planning on upgrading to a Motorhome and thought we'd probably buy from Tom Johnson since that's where we bought our 5th Wheel but NO WAY. We will do our future business elsewhere.  Bad Service."
1.5,3,"I was working with the customer service staff for checking-in my travel trailer for some repairs and a recall notice from Keystone. I was very pleased with the very friendly young ladies helping me get what I needed. Though I was made aware it won't be looked at for several days, it was nice for them to let me know ahead of time. In a perfect world it would be done same day, and if I was traveling, I would hope they would have put my coach next up.
Just so you know, when you schedule an appointment, a week or more out, it is not to fix the problem, it is only to get a place in the queue.
Do not ask for your tires to be courtesy checked for air pressure, they charge $65.00 to do it as a ""service"" item. This sounds odd especially if you are spending a thousand dollars in the store and garage.
I did get a brake controller installed in my truck on the spot, that made me happy. Another service tech talked to me about my issues and offered many logical reasons and took time to explain the reason behind the failure so I would not repeat the same mistake. Kudos."
1.5,2,"I purchased a used RV from Tom Johnson in Nov. 2014. Our salesman said ""We will go over the trailer top to bottom and make sure everything is working before you get it"". To their credit they did check the major items; AC, TV, Fireplace, Heater and fridge. Unfortunately top to bottom meant I would not have to spend the next few months and nearly $2,000.00 repairing things as we found them broke. It got to be such a joke that when we woke up a few mornings my wife said ""I wonder what we will find today"". This is what I would have expected had I purchased from a private owner not from a ""supposedly"" reputable dealer.
To Date we have; replaced the toilet seal, replaced the vents under the bath sink, replaced the diverter valve for the LP tanks, replaced the gate valve for the grey water tank, replaced the door side outside lights, replaced the door locking latch, Replaced the TV and brackets in the bedroom, Replaced the accessory cable from the trailer to the truck, Replaced the LP hose to the off side LP tank, Replaced the latch on the sewer hose door even after bringing that one to their attention. Replaced the key lock on the front basement door. Replaced the locking devise on the screen door, Repaired kitchen sink drain, Found a 1x8 about 5 ft long jambed above the tires interfering with the living room slide???(about 1.5 hours to remove and repair) they reconnected the TV antenna backwards after repairing the blower in the fireplace, (about 2 hrs to figure that one out) and last but certainly not least, two breakdowns of the landing gear. One very obviously from a very shoddy repair job. Had to replace the entire landing gear.
And don't tell me I should have purchased the extended warranty. Every one of these would have been under a separete claim and covered only under the deductible except the landing gear and I would still be down $1500.
So much for ""We will go over the trailer top to bottom"". Next trailer I will purchase from a individual for many thousands less and make the repairs myself. Lesson learned."
1.5,1,"I drove over two hours last Saturday to keep an appointment with a sales rep. He called me when I was about an hour out to say he was too busy, to see another rep, whose name he gave me. He called me again when I was nearly there to say that rep was too busy too, and to just check in at the reception desk. Mind you, he emailed me and called multiple times to make sure I was coming! When I got there, there was no one free to help us. They pointed out the units I wanted to see and I and my friend did so ourselves. I then wanted to take a test drive. No one to help us again. It took nearly an hour, and when someone did surface, he got the unit stuck in a ditch, so no test drive. Meanwhile, I observed other people being helped, even taken on golf carts to go see units. The star treatment! I will say the receptionist and that poor rep who got the unit stuck in a ditch were nice, but to have been wooed to drive that distance and then blown off made me angry. The people I saw being helped were married couples. I am female and my companion was female. This is just an observation and you can make of it what you will."
1.5,1,"Brought my camper to Tom Johnson for warranty issues. They had my camper for about a month and was unable to complete the work before I had to take it. I'm waiting for them to mail me a part so that I can fix it myself. The tech I was working with said that he mailed it ( a month and a half ago) but yet I still haven't received it. 

I find it difficult to believe him only because one of the untruths I was told was that a particular project was completed and when I showed up unannounced I discovered the project wasn't even started. 

Talked to the service manager and because I didn't purchase the camper there that they had to take care of ""their"" customers first. Wow, I thought I was a customer or at least a future customer. Guess I was wrong, and with plans on trading for another style, I'll have to find another dealer who treats everyone as ""their"" customers. 

After looking Tom Johnson Concord,NC up on the BBB I discovered numerous complaints about their service department. I guess I should have done that first. The problem is that they are the nearest dealer that has the brand of camper I own."
1.5,5,I shopped all over the Carolinas for my new camper. I have to say this is where I received the best service and was able to get me what I wanted! Thank you Will Smith for helping me with this process and checking up on me after the sell!!

1.5,1,"Avoid Tom Johnsons at all costs. They've had my Newmar Coach for 7 weeks. Every week they tell me it'll be ready next week. Well next week never comes. Since it was taken over by Camping World all they care about is selling toilet tissue and sanitizer. Hopefully I'll have it back next week. Very disorganized and no sense of customer service. Service Manager Robert hides behind vm and doesn't return calls. Very poorly run service department. Of course the service manger is from Camping World with their mentality. I've kept Newmar in the loop as to the poor conditions there at Tom Johnson Camping World. I'll never go back. Newmar has given me other options in my area for future service with dealerships that are not Newmar service centers but said they would work with them. Newmar is s great brand, they should rethink having Tom Johnson Camping World as a dealer/Service Center."
1.5,1,What a horrible experience!!! Run as these guys are absolutely unbelievable crooks. Worst buying and service experience I have ever had in my 52 years
1.5,1,"Terrible service, they had our rv for 3 months ... left us hanging, got on the road and system was left in winterized mode when we never requested it in the first place.  Cost us extra money  didnt know what they were talking about. ..denied us warranty claims...just go somewhere else!"
1.5,1,"We bought a camper at the end of May, took camping 3 times and the water heater circuit board went out along with with a few other problems. Camper has been at the Concord facility for 2 weeks. They knew we needed it this weekend. We told them to at least fix the water heater. Find out today they just looked at it and don't have the part and will not have it for another week or more. Losing our money on this trip, $114 and probably our Labor Day trip also ($300). We talked to them 3 times in this 2 weeks to make sure everything was on track and were told it was. Don't believe anything they tell you, their service department is not reliable."
1.5,1,I ended up making my 5th wheel purchase at Sonny's Camp N Travel in Concord and I am glad I did too!
1.5,1,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced, and continue to experience.  I purchased a trailer in the Spring and has been in the shop twice, for over a month, and nothing has been fixed.  Will not return phone calls, will not give timeframes or updates.  With a brand new $35k trailer, camping has not been an option this summer......  

Highly recommend you think twice before buying anything from this company."
1.5,1,"OK, so this isn't my first issue with Camping World in Concord, NC. During the course of owning 2 campers, both purchased at Camping World, one from the Concord, NC location, the other from the Myrtle Beach, SC location. My first experience was horrible with the service department. After taking the camper in for minor things, I went to pick it up and it was covered with mud, they also messed up a wall while closing the slide, with the table. This is only the beginning, after pulling the camper for 4 hours, I opened the storage and my power cable was gone. 
#2 - new fifth wheel bought in October of 2017, the air in the Master Bedroom was not blowing cold air, a schedule appointment and 4 weeks later, nothing. This meant a call and e mail to their corporate office. After this, it took an additional 2 weeks to make needed repairs. 
#3 - when the new fifth wheel was purchased the Myrtle Beach store installed a Reese sliding fifth wheel hitch in my truck. It slide properly for the first two trips, was lubed accordingly and was removed from the truck for storage. I stopped in the Myrtle Beach location, they looked at it and told me to lube it. I lubed again per their instructions, nothing. So now the Concord location has had the truck for 5 days total, and stated it would be resolved by Tuesday, it's Tuesday and they will not return my calls. I've contacted Reese and per Reese, Camping World should just replace it, it's less than a year old. Camping World used the excuse of keeping my truck for pictures for Reese. Reese customer service says they do not require pictures. So before you make a purchase from Camping World, I would strongly recommend exploring other dealers and options. Sure, I've spent a lot of money with them, never again. I wouldn't purchase a damn thing, from them or any entity that they are associated with."
1.5,1,"-0 stars Horrible Nightmare stay away from this place. We bought a 2016 and started having trouble right away, all we got from Tom Johnson and his crew was the sound of crickets. So many major issues, my husband took it in to the shop and they claimed to fix it, he knew they lied, because the fake cabinet in the bathroom had never been opened! They called and said it was ready.... My husband hooked it up at the campground that next day after picking it up and water started spewing all over our camper from everywhere, flooding it! Can you say class action suit! Anyone interested email us ibelongtoiam@gmail.com"
1.5,1,The customer service is terrible. We made an appointment with a sales rep named Ron. He drove us to one trailer and started helping someone else. I will not patronize this business as he was very unprofessional and did not help us. We literally waited for 30 minutes and he never came back.
1.5,5,"Camping world of Concord is a great place. Their selection of campers and RV's is amazing. The buses they have are mind blowing. The staff was very friendly, and I know this is the place I will buy my next camper. If you are even close to this place, please stop by and see for yourself. Highly recommend!!"
1.5,1,"Buyer beware!!! I should have read the reviews before I bought a camper from camping world. My camper is only 4 months old and we bought it for a trip to Canada. Well that didn't go well. I live in Charlotte NC and my camper has been sitting up in Harrisburg PA for over a month with a bent spindle on the axle. The serviceman in PA said he has seen these issues recently on that kind of axle. 
Update .... axel fixed at no charge a month and a half later and they ""camping world"" knows I spent $700 to just get the camper to there shop. But they won't communicate with us about it. 
They are less than 2 miles away from my house, but i will never buy anything from them again."
1.5,1,"I brought my new camper in to have warranty work done to replace a lock that was jammed, seems simple enough.  This was the first week of July.  It took them 9 weeks, yes 9 weeks to fix the lock, the majority of the summer.  

I normally do not post reviews but felt I needed to let any potential camping world customers to beware.  This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  Calls and emails go unanswered, no communication.  The corporate office was of no help either.  

You may experience great service when they are selling you a trailer but you had better hope it never needs service.  

Read the reviews......  I wish I had......"
1.5,1,"Really, really bad customer service.  When my elderly dad and I politely asked a group of employees sitting around if one of them could quick ring up the two items we had because another customer was having involved issues with their only cashier in the store, we were rudely told that not one of the 20 or so staff hanging around could help and that we could go ahead and just ""wait in line"".  After another 5-10 minutes of ""waiting"" without any acknowledgement from the cashier, we asked for assistance more forcefully and a very nice woman immediately appeared and gave us a 20% discount for our inconvenience.  The other customer was still discussing his issue with the cashier after we made our purchase!  If only the nice lady had been called over when we had asked the first time :("
1.5,1,"I had found the trailer online that I thought I wanted and was ready to purchase.  I had waited a while and now it was only available at a couple dealers across the state and Concord was one of them.  Before I left I checked the website, then called and asked if they had that stock number available.  They said yes we do and I explained I was driving 3 hrs across the state to purchase.

First, we checked into the ""front desk"" and they paged a salesman.  We hung around for about 10 mins before one of the salesmen that had been walking back and forth said he'd go ahead and help us.  We walked out to the spot where the trailer should have been and nothing.  We went back to the main building, he called someone to help locate the trailer.  About 15 mins later, he finally comes back and says that they don't have the trailer, but the Colfax location does (transferred to another dealer).  I asked to speak with the person I spoke with on the phone.  Another 10 mins and I finally asked the front desk person for some assistance.  He called the Statesville location to see if they had a similar model.  They responded they had it and would go check to be sure.  In a couple minutes, they responded yes.  While on the phone, the phone sales person I talked to in the morning came out, talked with the front desk person, then disappeared again.  Before I left, I asked the front desk person who she was and was there any new information.  He responded that the trailer was transferred to the Colfax location.  When asked why she wouldn't speak to me, there was no answer.  I then asked the front desk person to call the Colfax dealer who supposedly had the trailer.  They responded yes, they had it, but at my request, he asked them to go look to be sure.  He provided me the phone and they started to make excuses.  I told them if they wanted to sell a trailer, they needed to go physically check and call me back in 10 mins.

We left and in about 10 mins they called me back saying they did NOT have it and never had it on their lot.  So... somehow they lost a trailer between the two dealers.

Forget the sales team at this location.  The only one that was even trying to be helpful was the front desk person, Eddie(?).  He's the one that should be part of the sales team.  After driving 3 hrs to a dealer and not even getting an apology or anything, you can bet I will NEVER go back to this dealer again.  The Camping World name is also getting hit as the overall experience with multiple dealers diminishes.

While there, we also witnessed another couple having issues picking up their new trailer with a confirmed appt from the sales rep, only to be told the sales rep hadn't made sure to complete the paperwork and forgot to tell them insurance was required to leave the lot."
1.5,1,I'd give them zero stars if possible. They ruined what was a great store and service dept when they bought Tom Johnsons. Now you can't even get anyone to pick up a phone!
1.5,5,"Love shopping at Camping World.  We were greeted immediately today by Mr Will Smith, RV Sales Associate offering his help on anything that we might be looking for. We are ""full time "" living in our RV and always look for Camping World in whatever area of the country we may be in. Camping World of Concord is  a very nice, clean and easy to navigate store."
1.5,1,"Absolutely do not take your RV here for service! One of the worst customer service failures I have ever experienced. I had 3 different service reps assigned to me (Calen, Jason, and now Denise). They installed incorrect parts, missed others completely and took way longer than they estimated. I had to take the camper back several times and 6 months later it still isn't fixed. I have made at least 6 trips there personally to find out what is going on and each time there is at least one irate customer at the service counter because of their failure. They never know whether the parts have arrived or not and after a trip to the stock room with one of the reps, I can see why. They have boxes piled all over each other with no organization whatsoever. To find your part they have to literally wade through the boxes reading labels and looking for the box that looks ""about the right size"". Are you kidding me? I will never go back there again! I am now so frustrated with this place that I am just going to order that parts myself from the manufacturer and replace them myself even though they should have been covered under warranty. Please do yourselves a favor and shut down the service department completely or hire new management to do a complete makeover."
1.5,1,Does not even deserve 1 star.  HORRIBLE customer service.   We drove nearly 3 hours as very interested Newmar buyers.   Blown off at the door by a sales team member!!   Would NEVER go back to this location.   This snobbish attitude is not common at the other locations my husband and I have been to as avid RVers!!   Stay away from this location.
1.5,1,"Absolutely the rudest sales experience. We went into look at a used camper listed on line as the price or best offer, they then added on $1000 in fees before taxes.  They messed up the paper work several times and we ended up walking out."
1.5,5,"Just wanted to give a special recognition and thanks to Erika, an awesome and incredibly helpful employee of the Concord retail store. Every time we go there, she is there to help us with suggestions and helps
find coupons and specials. We are disappointed if we go there and don't see her. An awesome employee and person!
Wendy and Neal Williams"
1.5,1,This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. Horrible service! The service manager was rude and unprofessional. He shouldn't even have a job after the way he spoke to customers. Marcus Lamonis needs to step in and end this location. Repairs that were suppose to be done never were completed.
1.5,1,Horrible customer service! Their prices are way higher then the other camping worlds. The finance manager is rude and she and the salesman will try to trick you into paying more with hidden fees. Take your business somewhere else!
1.5,1,"Do NOT patronize this place - worst customer service ever. I took my camper in for repairs and they held on to it for four weeks without doing much of anything without me having to prod them. They never called back, never answered emails, and when I escalated to the service manager, there was even less concern. They seemed nice at first, but they were ghosts - they never took any action. On top of all this frustration, no one ever apologized for the inconvenience. I even took my complaints to Camping World corporate - I have yet to hear back. Bottom line - buyer beware. These people do not care about the quality of their service and they don't care about their customers. Find other folks who care about your business and patronize them - I ran out of this place and I will not be back. I think the other reviews tell the story pretty well - the only reason these folks are in business is because of their location."
1.5,1,"Stopped in this morning to ask about a washer/dryer combo unit.   Stood by the parts/service area for 10 minutes watching one person on the phone, another helping a customer, one person shoving food in her mouth, another looked up at us and then looked down again and another on a computer.  Tons of camping world employees walking around but not one person asked if they could help us.  Husband finally got someone's attention and we were told ""oh that's the parts department"" where we were standing.   Finally I said, let's go - they don't deserve our money.  Honestly why are they so not customer oriented unless you are dropping tons of money there?   Do not waste your money there."
1.5,1,"I made an online cash offer on an older (but beautiful) RV.  A gentleman just called me back and was quite demeaning.  He asked me questions about my research to insinuate I was stupid for making the offer, but continually interjected the word ""respectfully"" to sugar coat his attack.  For the record, I have done more than my fair share of research and while my offer was a stretch, he's entirely off base.  The MSRP from 2008 is really irrelevant in 2016.  

Ultimately, on a $199,000.00 motor home, this guy was willing to come down a whopping ONE THOUSAND dollars.  And he even said ""maybe.""  When I told him that was insulting, he laughed and hung up.  

Professional?  No.  Motivated to work a deal?  No.  ""Respectful?""  No.  Able to motivate to a buyer?  No.

If you are looking to buy or sell an RV, consider selling privately online so buyers don't have to walk away because of a------s like this, and definitely buy from someone who believes in fairness.  I can see clearly why this place has such bad reviews."
1.5,1,"Please don't go the campingworld they sold us a new camper the end of June and had to return it for service the end of July and they have had it the whole month of August. The repairs are still not completed with no help in site. Will not recommend anyone purchasing a new camper from Camping World of Concord unless you want to make payments while it sits in their lot waiting for repairs. But I am thinking if you purchase a brand new camper why does it need repair after less than 1 month of use...
Kathy Towle"
1.5,1,"Don't waste your time going to Tom Johnson's or they will waste it for you. I called and set an appointment to stop by with my daughter to look for a 5th wheel. I was up front and stated that it would be fall before I'd be ready to purchase. ""Sure, come on out,"" said Paul the salesman. We drive out there for a quick whirlwind tour of the parking lot and was told that they did not have what I was looking for any longer. Went home looked on the internet and Bam! Three 5th wheels exactly like I wanted to see listed on their site! Called to verify and yes they did indeed have the models on their lot. Pretty evident I was just wasting his time.  Went back and spoke with management, but he didn't seem to care much. He apologized and hope I'd keep my business there. No, I've got other options... Won't be back."
4,5,"I have to totally DISAGREE with the last review!! We were having issues with a Chevy Colorado we bought and took to this Aamco to be diagnosed after not being able to get the get codes off the vehicle. Aamco took the truck in, tore it apart and found a wiring harness that was disconnected and evidence that the vehicle had been tampered with!! They had the truck for a day and a half and even provided us with documentation for the loan company. They were not able to get the trucks main module to connect with their diagnostic computer and that was why they went through it with a fine tooth comb to find out why. Because the wiring harness and wires were disconnected the module burned out and the truck wouldn't run properly. We found out that it would have cost a small fortune to fix and Aamco did all this for only $100!!! They saved us probably a couple thousand in repairs!!

We have since been back for oil changes and have bought a new (used) vehicle in which we are going to have them look over for us. They are very nice and seem knowledgeable. No bad ""vibes"" here! They didn't try to sell us anything and only did what we wanted everytime we go in. 

My only complaint would be that they didn't update us and when we called them they had closed (this was a Sat) early and they didn't call to tell us they had to keep the truck. We called them Sunday to learn the truck was ready.

We will continue to use Aamco, at least for oil changes and inspections!!"
4,1,If I could give them 0 stars! I would! Complete ripoff! Engine never had issues until I took it to them! I needed my window regulator replaced and they messed with my engine to get more money out of me! They tell you that if costs 1000$ to fix when that's not even the issue! Completely crooked and will never take my vehicles here again! Spread the word and better off youtubing it and fixing it yourself for 1/8th of the price! Or take it to a person that knows how to really work on a car!
4,5,Nick and the boys were great. My 2004 Dodge Dakota was overheating and they found a blown head gasket and a few other problems and took care of it at a reasonable price and the truck has been running smoothly ever since. I will always bring back my truck for any service it might need in the future.
4,5,"Just had a great experience with Nick & this shop. My Subaru needed a new clutch & flywheel, and I got a great repair for a fair price - much less than a dealer would cost and it was finished the same day. I noticed every customer coming in was treated well. I really appreciated that since a lot of women aren't when it comes to cars & car repairs. 

Yes, I would come here again and will recommend this place to others."
4,5,So it's been quite some time since I've been here. Purchased a new truck and received free oil changes and it's hard to beat free. Once they were up I came back here and within minutes of stepping in the door I was immediately recognized and greeted by Nick (which just goes to show the pride they take in taking a personal approach). Again the service was amazing. The work work was done quickly and with the highest level of workmanship as always. I showed up about a half hour early from my appointment time and planned on just waiting till they got to my truck and they had it done before my original appointment time. Can't beat that kind of service these days! Greatest place to get work done on your car or truck by far.
4,1,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!
They didn't fix my radiator correctly. Went back again and again. Overheated on the freeway at night  twice because of their poor work. They told me that I need a new engine which would be $2000.00!!! My mechanic was finally available and had to tow my vehicle to his shop and fixed it correctly. I called Armco Corp office and was told I would here back from the owner or the Corp office. Nothing! They charged me 394.00!!!  Tried to get $2000.00 out of me. BEWARE OF THIS AAMCO!!!!"
4,1,"Update to previous review. After 3 weeks in service at AAMCO, finally got the car back and it drives worse than before the transmission rebuild. Check engine light came on less than a week after we got it back, returned to AAMCO and they replaced the crank shaft sensor. Husband picked it up today and the check engine light is no longer on but car jumps and jolts when shifting (automatic transmission). He says it's worse than ever. Very upsetting... I don't trust this car anymore.

3/28/16 - check engine light is on again and symptoms are still the same. My husband will be taking it back to AAMCO again today and cancelling his Birthday plans.

4/11/16 - car is back in the shop again as it will not drive in reverse now. No one has called with a status update as to how long the car will be in repair this time. We have no loaner or replacement vehicle.

4/12/16 - AAMCO offered a rental car and plan to rebuild the transmission again. They found metal in the transmission pan this time. From what I've Googled, that means the automatic tranny is about to go out. The tech seemed to blame faulty Nissan parts. I don't know what to think.

4/20/16 - car is still in the shop. No call or update from AAMCO."
4,5,These guys are awesome. Nick always tells it to me straight. I Bring my 96 ram 1500 4x4 here and my 07 civic hybrid for everything. I don't ever write reviews but felt compelled to since these guys always take care of me. I've had to come here for issues from my brakes being redone to chasing wires with ignition problems. Always fixed and always done quickly and professionally. I don't see myself going anywhere else for my auto needs.
4,5,"Excellent service in a new, clean location! I had a headlight out and the old bulb was stuck in there. 
Thankfully, the helpful fellas at this AAMCO were able to help remove the old bulb and swap in the new one. I was in and out in just about 15 minutes. The manager even helped me himself. I'll be back next time I have an issue or just need an oil change."
4,5,"I am grateful to these awesome guys at AAMCO!! They are honest and have saved me literally thousands of dollars. I had a flat tire near my work and took it to a Sun Devil Auto in Sun Lakes, AZ and they told me not only did I have a flat tire, I needed over $4,000.00 in repairs. I almost started crying. I had no idea my car was such a lemon!
I took my car to AAMCO after getting a Living Social deal and they told me the only thing they found wrong with my car is that I had a leak in my power steering hose. It cost me $115 and that was it!! They said my car was fine and there was nothing else wrong with it. 
That was over 30,000 miles ago and the car is still going strong!
Don't go any place else!!"
4,5,"I brought my car in just to see what preventive maintenance could be done on the transmission. It had 140,000 miles and no previous transmission work. The staff at this Aamco took my car for a test drive and inspected it for free and even told me the best option for service instead of trying to upsell me on some huge expensive maintenance or replacement program. I ended up not choosing to do any work and they gave me the inpection for free and even explained a breakdown of the mechanics diagnosis to me. Thanks for the help, if I do ever need work on my vehicle I will bring it here!"
4,5,I have been coming here for a year plus now and bring every vehicle I have in my business and family.  Every time I call I can count on either Nick or Mitchell to make sure things get done quickly and not with bs repairs.  I was even stranded on the freeway and they got a tow truck to me in under 45 min and they paid for it!  I will continue coming here and sending anyone I know here because a good mechanic shop is truly hard to find.....  Special thx to Nick
4,1,"I took in my 2006 E350 Mercedes Benz    They told me it would be $3200.00 I went to another repair shop and they quoted me $2200.    Went to another ASE certified repair shop and it turned out to be two seals were leaking . Total with  new filter, seals and  new fluid $425.  Do I need to say more ?"
4,5,Great service and honest mechanics. Nick is awesome! I've  brought both my vehicles in for repairs and I'm very pleased. I definitely recommend you go here.
4,5,"Had to have my 06 town and country transmission relearned with new solenoid pack installation. Dropped it off in the evening and it was done next day. Now shifts better than ever! Ask for Mitchell, he was great. BTW price was more than reasonable. I will be recommending everybody to this location! Thanks again guys!!!"
4,1,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!
They didn't fix my radiator correctly. Went back again and again. Overheated on the freeway at night  twice because of their poor work. They told me that I need a new engine which would be $2000.00!!! My mechanic was finally available and had to tow my vehicle to his shop and fixed it correctly. I called Armco Corp office and was told I would here back from the owner or the Corp office. Nothing! They charged me 394.00!!!  Tried to get $2000.00 out of me. BEWARE OF THIS AAMCO!"
4,5,They are very nice. They fixed my car in a few hours. It needed a few minor things fixed.
4,1,Lol you couldn't even fix the window regulator correctly. It goes down crocked and you can hear the regulator slam against the door when you close it. Damn rip offs just sad that you all tried to charge me triple the cost of a part when it's cheap at other places. Good luck in life and hope business stays up.
4,5,"I have been coming here since April 2012. I won't go anywhere else! Grant it i come here for my oil changes but none the less i get GREAT SERVICE!!! Nick is 99% at the counter each time i come in and has always greeted me with a smile and is super friendly. If i make an appointment i am always out under 45 minutes. You can beat that.This location is out of my way but it's definitely worth the drive for really fantastic service.

I noticed that the review from 2010 is a bit old and clearly the staff has changed since then. This new crew is a great crew, it has been the same since i have been coming here. I like that this place is honest and recommends things that you need rather than just dig in your pockets like some places. 

Thanks Nick and your  team for always providing me with GREAT service!!!"
4,1,"Well I am rating this place low due to the infuriating and frustrating experience we endured. Brought a 2005 Nissan Maxima in for possible transmission problems on 2/23/16 and were told they could not identify the issue unless we paid them to take it apart to find the issue. Ok fine... We wanted the car to be well maintained so we let them proceed. They ended up recommending that the transmission be rebuilt, which is a huge expense. This was quite a shock but we decided to get it taken care of so we could move on. One week later the car was still in the shop, not fixed. It reportedly kept failing the road test.

They did not call regularly to keep us updated on the progress of the repair, we had to call them. This left us hanging on a daily basis so every night we had to scramble to figure out how in the world we were going to get to work and errands, etc. There was a lack of trust because they could not provide an accurate time frame of when it would be ready. (We were quoted multiple days/times it would be ready but when those times came it was not).

They finally offered us a rental car on 3/4/16 which helped alleviate some stress, but picking it up was a hassle because the rental car agency did not have their billing account on file and it took over an hour picking it up. 

On 3/9/15 - we finally got the car back. It appears to be running fine. Hopefully all is well from here on out. We were told there was a long drawn out process to reprogramming the sensor for the transmission and it was due to the year/model of our car. I don't know because I'm not a mechanic."
4,5,"I bring all my vehicles here. After my former shop changed hands and the service went downhill, I started coming over here. They do a great job, they're honest, and the price is fair. The staff is very pleasant as well."
4,5,"We've been to this workshop twice. 

The first time around, we went in because the shield underneath my daughter's car was loose and scraping the road. They fixed it, same day and at absolutely no charge. 

The manager and the technical staff are very pleasant and eager to help. They really spend time checking everything without making us feel like it was a rushed check up.

The second time around, my daughter felt that her car was not balanced when driving on the freeway. We made an appointment and they checked the car, again at no charge. The inspection showed no major problem and there was no reason for any urgent repair. They literally didn't quote us an imaginary number just to get money from us, they actually do their job honestly and better yet, thoroughly.

Further to that, the front desk manager generously explained to us all the issues and enlightened my daughter on many aspects related to driving and mechanics, something she wasn't familiar with in the slightest. It was great, we walked out feeling calm and reassured that everything is running well and that we have people there to help us whenever things go sour. 

Definitely coming back here again and highly recommend."
4,2,"Beware!

This place was dishonest with us right from the start. When our transmission died, they told us they would tow it for us and let us know what was wrong for just $50. It sounded reasonable, but knowing how these places can be, my husband specifically told them that would be fine as long as it stayed within the quoted $50 range. They picked it up in the morning, and after not hearing from them for several hours, my husband had to call from work that afternoon. After giving us our repair quote, they immediately wanted their $50 payment over the phone. And, oh yeah, by the way, the towing company would be expecting another $50 once they returned it to us. This would not have been a big deal if we had known from the start. But I will certainly not be trusting them with our repairs if they cannot give an honest price for a simple tow! 

Also, we have already received quotes for at least $300 less than their repair cost. I recommend doing your homework when it comes to this place!"
4,4,"My wife took my daughter's car to Desert Sands to have the check engine light  checked.  Even though we have AAA, they blew her off and told her to make an appointment which may take a day or two.  I told her to take it to AAMCO on Southern and Ellsworth which she did.  Even though they were incredibly busy, the gentleman behind the desk came out and read the light (which took 15 seconds).  He told  my wife it was the gas cap (which I figured but did not want to take a chance with my daughter) and that if it continued, the seal may be bad and I should buy a new one.  No charge, in and out.  I don't know why Desert Sands could not have helped my wife but I will not be going back. We will go to AAMCO and tell others to do so as well.  Very helpful, friendly and professional!!"
4,1,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!
They didn't fix my radiator correctly. Went back again and again. Overheated on the freeway at night  twice because of their poor work. They told me that I need a new engine which would be $2000.00!!! My mechanic was finally available and had to tow my vehicle to his shop and fixed it correctly. I called Armco Corp office and was told I would here back from the owner or the Corp office. Nothing! They charged me 394.00!!!  Tried to get $2000.00 out of me. BEWARE OF THIS AAMCO!"
4,4,"This AAMCO has impressed us with their knowledgeable staff and excellent customer service.  We drive the extra miles to service our car and SUV here.  The staff is very trustworthy they don't try to hard sell you anything.  They are matter of fact, they always answer your questions thoroughly and give you options instead of telling YOU what to do.  If you call, ask for Cipri, she will take care of you."
4,5,"This place is awesome. Nick at the front counter is extremely friendly and helpful. Very fair with pricing for parts and labor. I'll recommend this place all day long to anyone and everyone. Just make sure to call in advance to schedule an appointment.  Because of their great service and work they are always busy. They get the job done and the quality shows. Best level of experience, knowledge and customer service I've come across by far.  Very happy I came to this shop. Only one I go to now."
4,1,"Do not take your car to this AAMCO! I've been there a few times and have not liked my experience any time I've been there. They always try the upsell and sometimes for things you dont even need.

I gave them the benefit of the doubt after the first visit. I came back a second time and felt the same vibe. The third and last visit is why I'll never go back.

I took my truck into have the AC looked at. It had been blowing hot for a few weeks. They looked at it and told me that that their was a leak in the condenser. They filled it with freon and said that the freon leaked out as fast as they put it in. They told me that it wasnt a good idea to replace just the condenser and that I should replace the whole ac system. The quote for this job: $1100! 

I went and got a second opinion.

Turns out that the high pressure valve was worn out and needed to be replaced. I did the work myself. Part cost $6 and the freon to fill it cost around $30! AC blows ice cold now!!!!

AAMCO tried to STEAL over $1000 from me. Do not take your car here!"
4,5,"New AAMCO in the neighborhood. I found them to be very friendly, honest and actually accommodating considering they were extremely busy. I would return in the future for more service!"
4,4,Nick was very helpful and got us in and done in a timely manner and it cost less then I expected. We will be coming back! Make sure to check in on here and get the 10% off coupon.
5,5,This place is fantastic if you have an RV or truck and need accessories put in. Anthony knows his stuff and seems like an all-around great guy to work with. They install two hitches on my new 5th wheel and I'm going back to get some vent covers installed when they come in. Highly recommend this shop as they are cheaper than RV dealers on the same product. Staff is wonderful polite and very helpful.
5,5,So we just dropped $1400 here and this isn't the 1st time that we dropped large money we absolutely love spending our money here it's well worth it they go out of their way to help you my going ed helped us attach all of our equipment and the owner is just absolutely amazing. They will price match their dog and kid friendly absolutely if you need it they can get it.
5,5,I've been here twice and am very pleased with Anthony and his team. I was in a jam on a Fri afternoon and they made a replacement power cord so I could tow a vehicle with my motorhome. The camping trip would have been canceled without their quick service. I am always treated well at Camp Out and highly recommend them!
4,5,"Now that Yelp has a service where you can receive quotes from multiple companies with one click, it saves so much time!  I was looking to get a trailer hitch installed on my vehicle.  Tom's Camperland popped up as an additional company to get a quote from as well as 7 more companies.  I received almost instant responses from all these companies.  However, Tom's Camperland recommendation (they do not install hitches) was able to help me out. Thank you so much for the recommendation!"
4,5,"Generally, I'm a nice person. But, to be honest, I also have a general dislike of salesmen.  I think it's fair to say, who doesn't? They tend to hover around you as if they're afraid one of their coworkers will steal you away (along with their commision). And sometimes they talk your ear off because they're scared of awkward silence. Ugh. 
That being said, Zach at Tom's Camperland is none of those things. He is the exact opposite of all those pushy and annoying traits. He is the first salesman I've met that I truly, truly appreciated. He is perfect, I wish he could be my salesman for every purchase I make for the rest of my life. He approached us in a laid back manner, offered to answer any questions, then told us where we could find him, and left us to look around on our own! Zero pressure! He was helpful, knowledgable, patient, flexible, efficient... Do I need more adjectives? We can't wait to take our new Arctic Fox truck camper out on the open road! So, go to Tom's Camperland and ask for Zach."
4,5,"These guys are the best.  Bought a shell for my new truck first.  Another little dealer, who shall otherwise remain nameless, wanted to sell me a cheap shell that had been sitting outside in their yard on the rack in the elements for a couple of years, from a company that had gone bankrupt no less (they disclosed no warranty, but not that the manufacturer had gone bankrupt).  To install it (install weather stripping, set on bed, 15 minutes to wire, attach four clamps), they wanted another $299!  Tom's sold me a brand new shell that they ordered from the manufacturer with warranty (no sitting in the elements for years) for $100 more, and then didn't charge me a thing to install it save for the cost of the four clamps.  I had even looked for the cheapest price for the clamps on-line from an etailer, and Tom's price was the same.  How often does a brick and mortar business compete on price like that?  So I got a brand new shell with full warranty installed for less than the other guys were going to charge.  You want to go even one step better?  Tom's had a used shell on the lot that fit my truck (although not perfectly as it was built for an extra-cab and had a slightly different slope on the front which did not line up 100% with my crew cab - just a small gap but still could have bought and used it).  They offered to install the used shell and let me use it as a loaner while I waited the two weeks for my new shell to be manufactured and delivered!  Are you kidding me!  I didn't really need the shell that quickly and declined, but good lord, talk about customer service.

Next was a small overhead truck camper.  Tom's had several new and used models on the lot.  The little guys don't sell these, so unless they happen to have one in on trade, you won't find any there.  There is another outfit in town that does sell them new, and they had one used on the lot, but if you want a used overhead truck camper, Tom's is really the only place to go.  Zack, one of the best salesmen/customer service reps I have ever worked with, spent all the time in the world showing me around their inventory and answering the hundreds of questions I had - both about the shell and the camper.  Between the two purchases, I probably visited Tom's 6 or 8 times, and took up several hours of Zack's time.  The only knock I could give him is that when I was first looking, before I bought my new truck, I was trying to stay with a quarter-ton truck, which Zack said you could do.  Now that is technically true, but while looking at Tom's in Surprise, the salesman out there, when he heard I had not purchased the new truck yet, told me point blank that ""if you only have a quarter-ton truck, you are not really a truck camper guy.""  Thanks to him I ended up buying a Chevy 2500 (Chevy/GMC have the most payload, period), and I am so glad I did.  When the truck and camper are fully loaded with food, water, people, dog, and gear, I don't think a 1500 would really cut it.  Again, you could do it, especially if you are just hauling the camper and not a lot of other stuff, but I'm not sure how long your drivetrain and suspension would last with that load.

Anyway, got super lucky at Tom's on Apache, as they had a clean 2009 Lance 825 on the lot which was perfect!  I snowboard in the winter and this baby came from Montana originally and had the winterization package.  Even better, it was an older design that Lance does not make anymore - instead of the large overhead storage bin/child's bunk over the dinning table, it had a small storage shelf and a huge picture window - I'm talking twice the size of the windows in the new Lance 825's.  I camp/hunt/fish on the North Rim of the GC, and on the Mogollon Rim, and that window is just perfect for the views.  I asked Zack if I needed to test and inspect everything as it was used and no warranty.  He said they should have tested everything out, but if I found any issues they would take care of them ""as long as its not like six months from now.""  Well, I bought that camper in February, and between snowboarding trips, summer camping trips, and the luck of drawing both a deer and an elk tag this year, did not get back in to Tom's until last week (well over six months) with a list of about a dozen little issues I had found.  Without a word Zack drove the truck back to the service bay and a couple of hours later, each and every one of them had been resolved.  I am so happy with the service and attention I received from Zack and Tom's that I could almost cry.  You just don't find businesses that treat their customers so well anymore, both on price and service.  If I ever need anything else, Tom's is the only place I will ever go.  They have definitely earned my loyalty and a customer for life.  Thanks guys!"
4,5,"My wife and I purchased a used truck camper from Zach at Tom's last August for a trip we are planning this spring. It was apparent from the start that Zach, Brad (the owner) and the rest of the staff have not only a passion for the products, but also,a passion for great customer service.  Little did we know at the time how strong that passion is.  We used the camper only once before we discovered a problem.  Unfortunately we discovered the problem after  few months, well beyond any reasonable expectation of warranty coverage for a used camper. I won't go into detail of the problem, but it was evident that the problem had been concealed by the previous owner from Tom's as well as me.  I took the camper in and spoke with Zach about the problem.  I asked for an estimate hoping for some consideration in view of the circumstances, but fully expecting to pay for the repair.  Zach said he would have the service department look at it and get back to me. I spoke to Zach yesterday and he told me my camper is repaired and ready for pick up.  When I asked about the charges he told me"" there are no charges""!   I just want to thank Zach and also Brad for creating an business culture that encourages great customer service.  We purchased from Tom's years ago and knew they were a great place to deal with.  I wish Tom's Camperland continued success and am confidant that they will be around for years to come."
4,4,I have to say. Brad the owner of toms really cares about his customers and takes pride in his business!  There's not many places where the actual owner reaches out to the customer to make sure every sale is satisfied.
4,5,"We bought our first pop up trailer from Little Dealer Little Prices pretty much knowing very little in the RV industry in general. Fast forward two years we gained a lot of experience and general RV knowledge that we were greatly lacking. We enjoyed our pop-up but knew we wanted something easier to travel with. We began our search and our attention quickly focused on the r-Pod by Forest River. Tom's Camperland had the biggest selection so it was our first visit here to look at these trailers. From our perspective comparing both buying experiences between Tom's and Little Dealer, there is NO comparison, it was an amazing experience working with Tom's. Their extensive sales team knows a lot and they had a great selection of products on hand to see. In the end we happily ended up trading in our pop-up and bought a new 2018 r-Pod Hood River Edition. The buying process was easy, no haggling, and very straight forward.

We could not be happier with our trailer selection as well as having Tom's in our corner going forward.

Great job to the entire team at Tom's..!

Sincerely,
A loyal and enthusiastic NEW customer...!"
4,5,"I was recently in the market for a camper shell for my Ford F-150, and couldn't be happier to have found Toms Camper Land.  I was fortunate enough to get to work with Brad.  He was very informative and took extra time to answer all of my questions.  Never once did I feel like he was selling me something or needed me to buy something.  I genuinely felt as though he was interested in my purchase and wanted me to make the best decision for me.  Needless to say I purchased the Overland series by ARE.  It was installed perfectly and is exactly what I wanted.  I even had a couple of last minute add ons they were able to accommodate me with.  I highly recommend you check out Toms camper land.  Their selection is massive.  You could walk around for hours just looking through campers.   These guys are really great."
4,5,"We are more than pleased with this firm.  Early this year, we purchased a Lance Travel trailer from Toms...  We found the staff more than professional, low key, non pressure, and helpful.  

We were trading in our old trailer, and on the way to seal the deal with Toms, we were broadsided by an inattentive driver.  The trailer sustained some damage, but Toms recommended a place to take it, and even went ahead with the deal while our old trailer was being repaired.  This enabled us to make a planned trip vs. waiting for the repair to be completed.

While on another trip this summer, we were far from Toms, and our air conditioning went out for no apparent reason.  Toms walked us through all the usual fixes for the problem over the phone, and finally recommended a place near where we were in Colorado.  We ended up taking it to a different place, but it was easily fixed.  Back home, we called Toms, and they took an email cc of our receipt, and are mailing us a refund for our issue in Colorado.  They are going to handle all the dealings with the Lance Company for us, but are not having us wait...  the check's in the mail.  

The service the folks at Toms have showed, is really wonderful in this age of profit only motivation in some firms.  We highly recommend Toms Camperland of Phoenix for RV purchases and service."
4,5,"First of all, I think it is unfair for Rico L to post a 1 star review based on his brief experience.  Did they not even ask for help?  How can they assume they were ignored intentionally?  Give them a break, they are busy humans after all.

As for my experience.  5 stars.  I bought the trailer sight unseen and from California.  I had to put a lot of trust into Allen and while he had several opportunities to take advantage of the distance, he treated me as if I were a local.  When I arrived to pick it up, Allen took the time to walk me through it and made sure everything was good to go as I was headed out camping that very next night.  I did have some issues, but Allen took care of it for me right away.  They even delivered a part that was missed to my friend's house.  When I found out the battery was defective, and already back home in California, Allen did the noblest act that can be done under the circumstances: he sent me a check for a replacement battery.  All and all I wouldn't hesitate to do business again with Tom's Camperland."
4,5,Great experience buying our T&G camper. They weren't high pressure easy to deal with. We did have a discrepancy with a screen room that we bought with the camper. I was waiting to get the runaround but that never happened. Zack took care of the problem and rectified it quickly. They seem to be very honest. I would definitely recommend them. In fact we live south of Tucson and the RV dealers down here don't have a very good reputation therefore we bought our camper based on reviews that I've read on Yelp.
4,4,"Awesome people, family business. Must have patience here because they r very busy. Good Maint but have to stay on top of them getting it done. Quality Lance trailers !"
4,1,"I've been meaning to write this for two years now.  
They sold me an absolute lemon. I sincerely home it was an honest mistake, though I'm pretty convinced otherwise. 
They convinced me they had a Palomino pop up camper that was immaculate... only owned for six months by an older gentleman, and that he only used it once or twice, and realized it was too much for him.
They even convinced me to give a deposit over the phone because they were certain it was going to go quick.  (sucker, I know)
I drove out there from Huntington Beach, with my wife and newborn.  They got it on just before sunset and I drove back.
I should have known from the get go that something was wrong when it didn't sit perfect when collapsed.  More importantly, VERY hard for me to believe they didn't know!  It is very obvious to me that the previous owner probably backed into and overhang or something.
It has NEVER operated right, and parts continue to fall off.  I am dropping another $2000 to repair it this week.

VERY Frustrating.... Shop elsewhere first!"
4,1,"I had purchased a Leer camper shell off Craigslist and it didn't match the color of my truck. I called Tom's Camperland and they said they would paint it for $400, and considering they were an authorized Leer dealer, I felt comfortable going with them.  When I dropped the shell off, the man I was dealing with said there was no way they could do it for $400, however, if that's what we were quoted, they would have to honor it.  When it came time to pay, he added on a $75 handling fee, which was never previously discussed (almost as if they were trying to make up for the low quote I was given).  When I called originally to get the quote, I asked where they had their paint jobs done, the man beat around the bush and just said a local body shop.  When I went to pick up the cap, I saw a Maaco truck dropping off all of the caps.  Boy, let me tell you, it was definitely a Maaco paint job.  There was chipping around all emblems and lights, the clear coat was missing in some areas, and the worst of it all, they never opened the windows to paint behind them.  So, when I opened my windows, the original paint color stuck out like a sore thumb.  I took it back up there to have them correct it, and even after the second paint job, I'm still unhappy.  Another issue we had with them...I ordered keys, a locking harness, and a few other items for the shell the same day we dropped it off the first time.  It took over 7 weeks for the keys to come in, and when I went to pick it up, the key didn't fit.  The guy told me that I would have to buy a new lock assembly, and that this sometimes just happens.  He told me would look into it and call me.  This didn't make sense to me, so I started calling around, and I actually called a Leer distributor in CA, and they told me that Tom's Camperland ordered the wrong key to begin with.  When I called Tom's back to tell them this, once again, he said he would look into it, and called me two days later with the correct key.  If I hadn't have done my own research, I would have been stuck with a $100+ part that was unnecessary to begin with.  Needless to say, after 7 different trips up there, at 12 miles/gallon, I never received as much as an apology let alone any compensation.  Every time I called there, the man I dealt with seemed annoyed to hear from me, like I was inconveniencing him for HIS errors.  To top it all off, I NEVER received a call anytime my parts were in or my cap was finished, I always had to call THEM to check on the status.  Their customer service stinks!  I'm not at all a complainer, but I've never had such a bad experience with any company.

If I wanted a Maaco paint job, I would have called Maaco."
4,5,"When you want to do business with with a company that does everything the right way, then you want to deal with Tom's Camperland. We purchased a new Lance 1985 TT from Tom's and traded a Truck Camper that we had purchased from Tom's 4 years ago. We're were given fair trade in value and a competitive purchase price on the Lance. 

Our initial delivery inspection was thorough and all questions were answered in a knowledgeable and relaxed manner. We had two small issues with the trailer that were remedied immediately and without incident. 

You will notice an immediate friendly and family like atmosphere with Tom's.... we drove from San Diego County to Sunrise to purchase a second time with Tom's, knowing that we would be treated well and fairly through every step of the process. 

Special thanks to Matt, Brad, Fred, Dave, Jack and Jose !!!"
4,4,"Nice people! I bought a used camper shell for my p/up from them over 10 years ago (still using it), and went back a couple years ago to get new rear hatch lift cylinders. Have always received good service from them!"
4,1,"Saw their website advertising a demo trailer at a lower price.   We were told they had sold it.  We found the exact trailer on the lot.  Same vin number.  They acted like they knew nothing about it.  Little deceptive in our opinion.  Would give zero if possible. 

Update:    Maybe I was a little harsh.  Received a response from Tom's pledging to resolve the confusion.  Toms honored the advertised price.  We ended up buying from the Surprise location.  We are happy with the way everything worked out."
4,5,"We picked up our new Lance 1685 travel trailer this past March 2017 from Tom's Camperland in Mesa, Arizona and we love it!!

We had a great experience overall with Tom's Camperland.  We drove all the way from Connecticut to pick up our new trailer, since our sales rep Allen gave us a very competitive deal on a fully loaded new unit we could simply not refuse.  At the time of our pick up, we had plenty of time to do our orientation and the pre-delivery inspection.  From the moment we walked in the door, the receptionist and people on the floor were very welcoming.  The service staff (with particular shout outs to Adon and Andy) was very accommodating and they showed us all the systems inside and out, with water and electric hooked up, including the AC.  I was also pleased they went over the hitch setup process with great detail.  Since I am new to towing, one of the staff rode with us around the city neighborhood to get a sense of how the rig would handle, how to handle turns, braking, backing up, etc., which was greatly appreciated.  Throughout the entire process, everyone at Tom's was responsive to our many questions and concerns.

We spent 10 nights in the Mesa vicinity at two lovely desert parks, Usery Mountain and Lost Dutchman, for our local shakedown.  Camping there in early April was delightful.  The camper was very well prepared for us for delivery, as everything worked well with no issues.  Our overall experience buying our first travel trailer from Tom's Camperland was excellent and I would highly recommend them."
4,5,"Went looking for a truck camper and met Brad Leach at toms camperland. He was very informative, warm and friendly and we chose a camper. During all of his dealings with us he was patient and thoughtful and one of the most outstanding human beings we have ever known in this business. I would wholeheartedly recommend Toms Camperland."
4,3,"I dealt with Tom's Camperland but did not end up making the purchase through them. After being asked to update my review, I agreed to as I too own a business and understand how a Yelp review can factor into a small business's success. 

Back to my experience with Tom's...

I communicated with Allen at Tom's Camperland who made me an offer on a small trailer camper. He then asked for a $500 deposit (which I paid) to secure the deal. He then changed the details of the deal. He didn't realize the dates we agreed to meet were Memorial Day - which he wouldn't be able to accommodate. In fact, he stated that my camper would have to piggyback with another camper TBD making its way to California (Tom's is located in Arizona). Needless to say, I was annoyed and bothered by the interaction. He then refunded my deposit and I moved forward with my purchase through another dealer. This was ""the resolution.""

What was interesting to me was that Allen later contacted me to offer the camper one more time - at which point I was already moving forward with a second camper from a different dealer.  At that point, the deal became complicated and stressful - my hope was that Allen would leave me alone to make my own purchase somewhere else. That's what I ultimately ended up doing. 

Even though I purchased my trailer through a different dealer,  I will consider Tom's Camperland for my future RV needs."
4,5,"Picked up an Adventurer 80RB and absolutely love it. We came from out of state and hashed out a lot of numbers over the phone before even seeing the camper. We wanted to make sure that everything made sense from a financial perspective before making the drive. All of our questions were answered right away and they were eager to please. After finally seeing the camper in person and deciding to go forward with the purchase, they quickly installed the tie-downs on my truck and gave us a loaner car to drive around town. We had told them that we also wanted to have solar installed, but didn't want to wait all day for the installation. Before I had even signed any paperwork, and completely over the phone, they went ahead and installed the solar ahead of time to help us get in and out of the dealership as soon as possible. We highly recommend Tom's Camperland for anyone looking to purchase a truck camper."
4,5,"I am an out of state customer that happened to come across Tom's Camperland. They had a Lance 951 camper that was specific to my 3/4 ton truck. It was used and Alan told me it was in great condition. Alan was spot on, not trying to make just a sale but a customer for life.  They set up my truck, gave me great training and everything we need to camp that night. I was suspect buying out of state, but be assured this is a top notch firm that goes above and beyond for their customers.

4,5,"We've been shopping at Tom's Camperland for generations now (so cool to be able to say that!).  We worked with Tom back in the day (now retired), and now with his son Brad, who's obviously able to walk proudly in his dad's shoes.  Great deals, honest advice (thanks Brad for when you recommend NOT to buy something, that really saves us time and money!).  We've purchased several A.R.E. shells (each new truck gets one), hard bed covers, and roof racks.  Every time it's been a terrific deal, and his guys are just downright EXCELLENT!!!  I bring magazines, or now my iPad when it's time to mount a shell, and darned if I ever get to read anything they're so fast.  In today's economy, this is one gem of a place and we're proud to be part of the ""family"" here.  Give them a shot.  I don't see how they can be beat.  Our new F-150 looks great with it's A.R.E. shell and we love the quality.  Thanks!"
4,1,"Watch out for these guys.  Don't give them any money until you are 100% sure of the deal and the unit.  They demanded a deposit to hold the unit even though I am from out of state and couldn't personally see the rig.  After I decided to go with another unit and agreed upon pricing and financing with the sales guy the finance person tried to get a little extra out of the deal.  Magically there was a $2500 rebate that I wasn't told about that brought the rate down to where we originally agreed upon. 

I blew up the deal after they attempted to play me for a fool and now they won't refund the $500 deposit they demanded and  assured I could get back if I decided not to go with the deal.  All they had to do was honor their end and the unit would have been purchased. 

I originally went for a used unit and decided to stick with them for a new unit I could have purchased at a number of dealers within an hour of my house.  

I've bought a lot of cars in my life and I've never meet such scummy people.  But hey, someone has to pay the owners Raptor payment since he got smoked with a crazy ADM.  Tools..."
4,1,"Everyone knows that one star is because you can't leave a no star rating. I went into Tom's Camperland today in a good mood and excited to see what I could do with my new truck and  to see about purchasing a camper shell now, with the intent to buy a trailer or full camper next. Well, when I do,it won't be here. 
Sure they have a beautiful show room but the sales guy was the worst. I had to ask the receptionist for help and that was obviously a bother to her. When I said thank you, she did not respond or even look at me. 
The sales guy was obviously not interested in helping me design and build a truck shell at all. He went and made a cal and then came back with a flat "" we don't have one for your truck"". He talked to me as though he had better things to do. Then his phone rang and he said"" I gotta take this , it's my boss"". I doubt that because if it was his boss, the boss would be like "" why are you talking to me, deal with the customer""
 That is unless thats how all the people here think, that my business doesn't matter. I guess if your only going to spend a few grand and not 30-40 your not worth the time. 
 After waiting five minutes or more for the sales guy to return, I walked out. 
 I'm going to Little Dealer, little Prices next.  Fingers crossed I get some help there."
4,1,No service after the sale. I had to teach them the proper installation of some of the equipment. Their guy didn't even fully load my camper and then stole my 120 dollar flashlight to boot. I had to yell and threaten to get service. At least I got an apology but not my dealt flashlight. Palamino campers are junk.
4,4,"I purchased a lance 2295, new.  I spent 3+ hours doing a predelivery insp.  Only one big issue which is a Lance design issue, in my opinion.  Allen and Andy did a good job addressing the fixes.  They are good folks and thus far I have had few issues.  The lance product is B very well made, and they had a great selection of other products.  I'll buy again from the boys"
4,5,"Tom's has been a rare and satisfying purchase in the RV industry. Our buying experience was great. Allen gave us a great price and made our purchase easy. 

Better yet, Andy in Service has bent over backwards to make sure the few small problems we have had were taken care of. If you aren't familiar with RV dealers and service, they typically suck. Not so at Tom's. 

If you are looking at a new camper do yourself a favor and give Tom's a visit."
4,5,"We purchased a pre-owned Alpenlite 950 truck camper from Brad at Tom's Camperland and were very happy with the whole experience. We are out in CA and found the camper we wanted online at Tom's Camperland. 

Brad walked through the camper on the phone with me testing equipment, answering questions, and had very descriptive pictures already up on their website. I was a little hesitant on purchasing the TC sight unseen but based on their reputation, photos, and conversations on the phone they seemed like a reputable business, so we went with it. Brad worked with me to get the camper delivered for a reasonable price and set me up with all the necessary gear to outfit my truck. 

Delivered as per schedule, fair deal, and the camper was in better shape than I expected! Big thanks to Brad and Tom's Camperland."
4,5,"Previously, we owned a Lance 1575 travel trailer purchased from Tom's.  Over the last year or so, when any service was needed on the 1575, they always more than met our expectations..  (hats off to Jose and the crew in the back). The overall experience was so good that when it came time to upgrade a bit, of course we went back to Tom's.    On our last purchase, we worked with Zach, who was great.  This time around, as we purchased our new Lance 1995 model,  we worked with Jason, who was also super to work with. 

We have nothing to say but good things about this group.  It is a excellent example that employees make a company.  If you have a great crew, as this company does, the sky is the limit.  I can tell you, it sure makes RVing a lot better for us, having Tom's as part of the picture.  Highly recommended.  :-)"
4,5,"When my wife and I decided to buy an RV we took into consideration that I have some physical limitations and we're both a little timid on the highway, so a full size RV just didn't seem like a good fit. We did a lot of research, talked to numerous people and decided we needed to proceed with a pickup camper. The Lance 1172; what a beautiful camper!  Of course we visited with numerous RV sales outlets. I'm not sure how we stumbled upon Zack at Tom's Camperland in Mesa Arizona, but from our first conversation he didn't sell us, he professionally informed us. He kept it short and honest.  Well, we made the trip to Tom's Camper Land and were very impressed with their facility.  Everything was first class. In person Zack was great and he knew the Lance 1172. We were sold with Zack and the Lance. We had an informative and comfortable tutorial session between Zack and Tristan, their technical expert, who did a great job in leading us through what we needed to know to get on the road with our new camper. Overall I couldn't recommend a better RV buying experience."
4,4,"We were looking for a small travel trailer to replace the old popup. We had a strict budget and had no desire to upgrading the truck to 3/4 ton. So we knew it would be a long search. We liked Tom's because they helped and answered questions when you wanted. But they left you alone to browse. We quickly got sick of having pushy sales people at other places. 

Tom's employees don't work on commission so there is no need for the hard sell. They are also one of the only places that caries these smaller trailers. Everywhere else has the huge RV and left us really worried about what we could find.

We bought a 2016 Rpod. So far we love it and are glad we used them. I guess the only knock I have is their web page does next to nothing listing the parts or services they offer. I end up calling or emailing them every time and I honestly feel like a pest. But other than that I would use them again."
4,1,Beware !!!!! We purchased a truck camper from Brad only to find out the guy we trusted was not upfront about alot of things. People .......do your home work and research the safety side when purchasing a camper. Also....review the numbers when dealing with any company and don't become a victim of the smooth talking salesman. Their new location has gone to their head. The lack of building lasting relationships with their clients is not a priority to this company.
4,1,I contacted Tom's Camperland multiple times to confirm they have insolator covers I need for my ARE tonneau cover. I was told they did have them and that the cost was about $4.00. So I drive from downtown Phoenix to their Sun City location to purchase them. Matt at their Sun City location proceeds to tell me they dont stock them and that the cost to order them would be $50.00. As i'm leaving the sales office I notice employee's working and ask them if they knew of this part. They recognize what i'm talking about and proceed to give me 2 of the covers. My understanding was they had some to spare. As i'm walking out Matt confronts me and accuses me of being a theif and a liar. He then proceeds to ask for the covers back. I returned the covers and left the store. I've never been so insulted or mad while trying to purchase something. My feeling is my skin color had a lot to do with the way i was treated. My reason for writing this is to warn any potential customers to avoid the embarrassment and aggravation of dealing with Tom's Camperland.
4,5,"Purchased lance 855s from toms, everyone was helpful and Allen got me a great deal. I highly recommend toms, they definitely treated me right and went out of their way for me thanks to all at toms!!!!"
4,5,"We just purchased our second camper from Tom's. Even though we are from Georgia, we shop at Tom's because our experience with them has been wonderful. They are knowledgeable,  thorough,  honest and accommodating. I would like to praise the whole team, particularly Allen and Adan and would recommend Tom's to anyone in search of a new or used camper."
4,5,Friendly and knowledgable service. No sales pressure.  Zach seemed to listen to my needs and recommended appropriate solutions.  Explained features and benefits of products as they would relate to my needs.
4,5,I purchased my second bet topper from them go my 2015 tundra. Their new place on Broadway and Alma School rocks.
4,3,"I have mixed feelings about this dealership. First of all, buying our RV from them was seamless and a pleasure. The sales people are personable, professional and accommodating. The price was the best offered in the entire western region, regardless of the claims made by other dealerships. The issue that prevents me from rating them higher,  is the fact that when we took possession of our RV, the ""walk thru"", was practically non existent. This is time set aside to educate the buyer on the ""workings"" of the unit. Because of this insufficiency, we have now spent 25% of our four week vacation in service departments in various cities. There are certain basics that need to be included when selling an RV, and signing a contract of this nature, should never be the final act."
4,5,"I bought my ARE truck cap 9 years ago from Tom's and they were great to deal with. Today I stopped by to get an estimate on replacing a few minor parts that had become worn. Despite being busy, they updated the parts quickly and at no cost. Thanks for the outstanding customer service."
4,5,"Well its been 6 mos since I purchased my new Lance 1995 from Tom's Camperland Mesa and I couldn't be any happier with the trailer and the crew at Tom's.

From the initial buying experience to the few times I needed to resolve a service issue (mostly just questions on my end) I couldn't ask for a better experience.  Allan was the initial salesman I dealt with and from start to finish had an answer to my many questions about everything from the trailer itself, to different WDH's, and everything in between.  At no time did I feel pressured to make a purchase or feel the need to haggle a price downward.  

When I arrived to pick up the trailer Allen was off and Brad stepped in effortlessly.  He helped with the final walk-through and fixed any issues I had spotted right then and there.  After I got the trailer home I realized that the shore power cord had accidentally gotten left behind. I placed a call to Brad and asked if he could locate it and secure so I could come back and get it. This was right at closing and as I live approximately 30 mi away I didn't believe I could make it in time.  Instead Brad took it upon himself to personally drive to my house and deliver it in person. Incredible.

I also want to mention Andy and the rest of the guys in the service dept.  After purchasing a new truck for my tow vehicle I realized I would need to adjust my hitch to keep everything level.  As I didn't own a 200lb torque wrench I called Andy for assistance.  He not only made time for me that day but did the service free of charge.  Keep in mind this was for a WDH that I had purchased elsewhere.  More recently I took a rock into the front windshield of the 1995 on my way to Alamo Lake. After a quick phone call Andy had me a new outer window ordered and on its way for installation.

I can't say enough good things about my experience with Tom's.  My fiance and I plan on becoming full time RV'ers in the future and I will be going to Tom's for everything camping / trailer related until we hit the road and drive away into the sunset."
4,5,Amazing place to shop for a New Camper!   No sales pressure sales staff.  Allan is wonderful to work with.  Get got a New Lance camper and just love it.  Thank you Allan for working with us and getting us into the camper of our dreams!
4,5,"Tom's Camperland is a great place to get a camper. I'm from San Diego and was in the market for a camper. After researching campers online I decided to get a Palomino Bronco 1500 for my long bed F250. Tom's had the only two PB 1500s with in a days driving from San Diego.
I worked with Allen over the phone and email and secured one Bronco 1500. It came with electric jacks and other options plus I had Allen add a 100 watt solar panel. Good price on the solar systems too by the way.
On my pick up day I arrived at 2 p.m and Allen took my truck over to their shop. The guys were ready and worked like a NASCAR pit crew setting up the tie downs and electric cable and loading the Bronco. 
After Allen walked me through all of the features (inside and out) I was on the road by 5 p.m.
While I was waiting I toured their inventory. I appreciate that they carry several different models instead of how some dealers will just carry only one brand.
I highly recommend Tom's Camperland, they have a good selection of campers but most all the people are knowledgeable, nice and their service was great."
4,5,"Toms Camperland's service is AMAZING! We went all the way out from San Diego to get our Aliner Ranger 12.  There are two distributors in CA, but none provided the service that Toms did.  The camper was on back order, Allen kept us up to date on the process.  My husband drove out to get it he said that they service was great, and that they took their time and showed him how everything worked.  We put our deposit down sight unseen and we got exactly what was promised.  I highly recommend Toms to anyone and I will definitely use them again!  Well worth the 6 hour drive."
4,5,"Tom's Camperland has a fantastic inventory, clean facility, and friendly staff.  My wife and I drove from Tucson last Saturday to browse their inventory.  We were greeted and made welcome immediately.  There was zero pressure from staff as we wandered the lot and the huge warehouse.  When we had questions about a specific unit, we were provided the information we needed in a friendly way.  We found the unit we were really interested in and made a deal to return the following Saturday (today) with our trade-in.   All of the paperwork was prepared through the week, so when we arrived today with our trade-in, the transaction was super smooth and fast.  We couldn't have asked for a better deal, or a better experience overall.   

Tom's was recommended to me by a friend who purchased from there last year.  I will definitely be recommending Tom's to my other friends."
4,4,"It's unfortunate that I just read poor review of this place, because our experience was totally the opposite.

My husband had been working with the dealer via email's and phone calls on a Little Guy trailer we were interested in on their lot.  We live in Southern California.  The right numbers came up where we were ready to make a purchase. With check in hand we drove out to AZ, not knowing if we were going to get what we saw and read on the ad.

We were greeted by the employee my husband was dealing with.  Before we were, we had saw the Little Guy and did our own walk around inspection and had a couple of questions on some areas.  But we got some reassurance from the manufacturing (via text) that all was OK after sending photos of our concerns.

The Tom's Camperland employee was very helpful and pleasant doing business with, we hope for the same for the next customers."
4,5,"I purchased my first camper from Toms camperland a few weeks ago. I bought a 2009 Lance camper. My salesman was Andy, and I cannot say enough great things about the experience.  I felt like a valued customer and was treated great by the entire staff. My unit was prepared professionally and has been a blast to camp in with the family!  There are not enough operations left with top quality customer service, and I would recommend anybody to visit and purchase from this store."
4,5,"Prices are right........people drive from California to buy from Tom's... or fly in from other locations... need I say  more?....They installed a break controller and 7 pin plug on my wrangler. Looks like it was installed at the Jeep factory.... excellent workmanship......They bend over backwards for you....my purchase demonstrates this fact....
.... I did not do my usual 2 weeks of research before deciding on which travel trailer I should buy... my jeep is rated at 3,500 lbs. so I needed something light weight...  I saw the tab and the rpod... I settled on a price for the tab and made the purchase..the next day, I saw it did not have the monitor panel for the adle system and water tanks...  no problem.. they switched the unit for me.....went to pick it up but it did not have the outside shower.. no problem.. they installed it....
Then..... I realized my jeep could handle the rpod...went back to pick  up the tab and  decided I wanted more room and needed to change my purchase to the rpod.. once again.. because we did not drive it off the lot or title it... no problem.. they switched my purchase to the rpod and I am sooooo happy with my purchase!!   There is absolutely zero sales pressure... none.... tons of rigs on the lot to inspect.....  great people from sale to service.....  thanks zach and the service guys for taking great care of me!! I will buy from them again!"
4,4,"Awesome selection of all campers! Nice indoor showroom. Sales people were nice and not overly pushy. Kudos! I was happy that we were able to ""try"" the sleeping arrangements since my husband is a tall man. Most showers he can't even stand in. This made it easier to decide what camper would work best for us. Now the challenging part, money."
4,5,"Allen sold us the perfect camper for our needs, and gave us an unbelievable deal. Edon gave us a first class walk thru when we picked up our Little Max Mini.
If I* could give these guys more stars I would !"
4,5,Traveled from n. Cal to pick up lance camper. Service was great. Thanks to guys in shop installed  camper tie down and loaded camper in  a matter of hours and I was back on road home.
4,5,"In Feb 2017 my wife and I were searching for a Lance 1685 travel trailer with a certain type interior. I called or visited several dealers in the southwest with no luck., that is until I called Tom's Camper Land in Mesa Az where salesman Jason Amalong answered the phone.  Although Tom's didn't have the exact model TT we were looking for, in less that ten minutes Jason called me back saying he located exactly what we were lookng for and at the price point I specified.  We made the deal over the phone and several weeks later we drove the 400+ miles to meet Jason and Lance.
Throughout the process Jason was a pleasure to deal with.  He went above and beyond to accommodate our requests and answer any questions.  Based on our experience with Tom's Camper Land @ Mesa Az  and salesman Jason Amalong I can, without hesitation recommend Tom's and Jason in particular if you are shopping for a new or used RV."
4,5,"Great experience with my salesman Allen Greeley!
1st time visit and Allen showed me around with no pressure just honest down to earth friendly help in exactly what I was looking for.

It's so nice to do business with a person that has the customers needs in mind instead of a quick sale and move on attitude!

I felt I was in good hands with Allen with his honesty and he did exactly what he told me when we wrote the contract.

I will be back and especially tell my friends to ask for Allen and see how nice the Mesa store is with all their inventory.."
4,5,"Easy to deal with!

I am also an out of town customer who gave them a deposit after receiving an email quote from them on a trailer.  When I arrived the trailer and deal ($4K less than anywhere else) were as promised.  I was in and out with no hassles or attempts to bump the price.

I am almost a year out from my purchase and have used their service department for a minor warranty fix and to add solar.  Great service, maybe a little high price on the solar but they did a great install."
4,5,We decided to buy our first TT (Lance 1995) out of state from Tom's Camperland due to the exceptional customer service from Allen Greeley and excellent price (no hidden fees)! Allen provided outstanding communication throughout the entire process. Overall great experience and would highly recommend Tom's Camperland to anyone looking for a camper.
4,5,We have Lance dealers 200 miles north or us and 120 miles south.  Neither could come close to the deal or delivery schedule Allen Greeley helped us with.  We saved thousands by making the 2400 mile round trip (2700 with a few planned detours) from Kansas City to the Phoenix area. It was beyond worth it.  All the staff were great including the truck equipment installers (great price on that too) and our orientation specialist.  Highly recommended.  Could not have had a better experience or deal.
4,4,"****UPDATE****

After discussing the problems with Tom's Camperland they have fully apologized for the situations at hand and have offered to help us with the payment of our mounting brackets and reimbursing me for the $55 fedex fee I paid. We will most likely be bringing the camper to a local dealership to have them check/repair the propane and Tom's Camperland has stated they will reimburse us for the expenses we accrue. Allen, thank you again for your concern and consideration. We are very happy with everything at this point and would recommend your company to our friends and family. Thank you again. 
------------------------------------------------
My husband and I drove out to Scottsdale 3 weeks ago with the intention of purchasing a truck camper for our Ram 2500 short bed. We had been researching the different brands and models and were ultimately led to Tom's Camperland because of the great reviews and multiple options they had available. 

We scheduled an appointment with one of the sales representatives, Alan, and met with him Saturday morning to look around at what they had available. The customer service from him and the staff was great and we made a decision to purchase a 2018 Eagle Cap 811 truck camper. They gave us an amazing deal and even offered delivery to California for free. 

We were so happy with how quickly everything was done and had agreed upon a delivery date of April 30th, a Monday that my husband would be home as he is a fireman and is usually gone 4-5 days of the week. We unfortunately did not get this in writing and the delivery date was changed by Alan who claimed that we stated we wanted to have the camper delivered May 7th.  This would have been fine, however I had just overnighted the sales paperwork on the night of the 27th assuming they needed to have it before the 30th and the office is closed Sunday and Monday. I spent $55 at fedex to have paperwork shipped next day for no reason. The camper eventually got delivered on the 4th and it was very simple and easy. Doug did a great job and I was very happy with the delivery and set up he provided. 

After we signed the paperwork at the dealership we did a final walk through and mentioned a few minor things to Alan. There is a molding that is on the left side of the ceiling above the bed that was falling down and we asked him to take care of it before delivery. It was not and the campers' cleanliness was lackluster. 

My husband was under the assumption that the mounting brackets for the truck were included in the deal and spoke with Alan about this. He advised they were not and that they would only cost ""a few hundred dollars"". My husband spent $1600 to get the brakets a large and unexpected cost to us. We also did not receive the hook for the manual side awning and will need that to be provided to us as it did come standard in the package. 

The last straw for me and the reason I am writing this review is the biggest safety concern I have ever come across with any sort of vehicle/camper. We turned the propane tanks on yesterday when we were testing all of the units in the camper and left it on all day/night. Completely acceptable if everything is connected correctly. When I was leaving for work I heard the carbon monoxide detector going off in the camper and had to wake my husband up. The entire camper smelled of propane and we turned everything off. 

My husband then decided to check for any leaks in the propane ports that were installed by the dealership before delivery. We have a video of the bubbles coming from one of the ports and I am just shocked, appalled and completely disgusted. 

If we had decided to take the camper out last night and slept in it we could have died. That is the short and sweet of it. There is no better way to put it. 

Apparently no one checked the installation and put mine and my husbands life as risk. I am writing this on a Monday and am aware that the dealership is not open. We will follow up tomorrow, but I expect an apology first and foremost and some kind of way to make this situation better. 

All in all get anything in writing and make sure to inspect all components of anything purchased before use."
4,5,"I had contacted TCL on a weekend via email, and a fella named Brad quickly emailed me back, I was quite surprised. I told him what i was looking for, and we spoke and he informed me of what they could offer. 

  Brad called me Monday and we discussed the camper top I was looking for and we agreed on a fair price. I was told it would take 2-3 weeks to come in. It came in 2 weeks, and they set me up with a time to go in for installation. 

  I have to say, the place is very nice. everyone is very helpful and pleasant. Brad, who turned out to be the owner, took me back to see the cap prior to installation. Man do they ever look too small off the truck. Anyway, the cap was installed and looks exceptional. Couldn't be more pleased. If I could add a pic of it I would. Everyone there is awesome, from the young lady at the front desk, to the owner.

  I highly recommend them."
4,5,"Friendly customer service and great selection of campers, toppers and bed covers. Lots of choices and fun to look around.  They are no pressure and give you the attention you deserve as a customer. Stop on in and give them your business if you're in the greater Phoenix area."
4,5,"We drove from Colorado to purchase our second camper, from Tom's Camperland in Mesa, a 2019 Little Guy Mini Max.  Allen Greeley and the team at Tom's provided another wonderful experience.  The camper was delivered exactly as ordered and promised.  We've camped 7 nights during the first two weeks of having the camper and are thoroughly enjoying our purchase from Tom's Camperland in Mesa."
4,4,"I would give these guys four and a half stars if I could.  I bought my hard side pop up from Tom's and was working with Brad the entire time.  I live in Albuquerque, NM and bought my trailer without seeing it first.  I had done tons of research prior to contacting Tom's and knew what I was looking for.  Brad was great on the phone.  We talked about options and all of the things I wanted on the trailer.  I was super excited because I thought my tiny little car would be able to safely pull the trailer as the model I bought is one of the lightest on the market.  I waited a month for my trailer to be custom built and during that month I changed my mind on a few things and Brad was great to handle my wishes.  The day finally came when I drove to AZ to pick up my trailer.  I was in my subcompact car that i had a class A hitch installed in.  I worked with Alan and Andy showed me all of the things about my trailer.  Brad and i met and said our hellos and thank yous and I was on my way with my much heavier trailer than I was anticipating.  I made it to Lordsburg, NM and my car's check engine light came on.  Long story short my car could not handle towing a nearly 1900 pound trailer.  While in Lordsburg I was able to trade in my car and get a large Ford Explorer.  I didn't have to worry about the trailer weight anymore.  Brad had emailed me to check on me to see if I had made it home and I let him know about the trade in.  He kindly offered to pay for the rewiring of the Explorer and refunded me several hundred dollars.  That's was incredibly kind of him and Tom's.  I took my trailer out two weeks ago and she is a beauty.  I'm so pleased with my purchase and may use Tom's again if I ever decide to trade up on my trailer.  Thanks to Brad and the guys at Tom;s."
4,5,Great guys and treat customers well. Went the extra mile by taking care of some small fixes during a part install. My topper is now in perfect condition.
3.5,3,The lack of Online Payments is turning into a major pain. Why is this the only storage place that can't seem to get their act together on their payment system?
3.5,3,"Amenities seem nice.  People...not so much.

Went there to see about an enclosed RV storage space.  Guy at the front desk (Ed) could not have been more unhelpful.  ""We don't have any of those"" and then went back to doing whatever he was doing before we arrived.  Okaaaay....do you have a waiting list? ""Well....how soon are you looking for a space?""  I got the impression that he did have a waiting list, but for some reason, REALLY did not like using it.  I guess calling people to let them know you have an open space is hard?   They have a display at the desk showing the status of the various units -- one of them (A111), showed as available.  I asked about that one.  ""It's not available"".  Then...why does your system show it as available?  If you know your system is unreliable or inaccurate, maybe don't prominently display it as a customer sales tool.

Then there's their pricing system.  They don't post prices online and they don't have a price sheet at the front desk.  Instead, they take a blank slip and write in prices at the time you ask for them and sign their name to it.  Just seems....shady.  Like are they making prices up based on how much they think I will pay?  (For the record, we were quoted $569 for a 15x50 and $399 for a 15x35.  These prices are high for straight storage, but they do have a lot of other amenities that may offset the higher costs for some folks.)

Overall, seems like a nice place with high(er) prices that might be justified if their customer service were on par with their prices."
3.5,5,"Hands down, this is the best quality RV storage in the valley! I love this place. The amenities are amazing. The facility is secured with a reliable gated entry, surveillance cameras and on-site security. Additionally, the power-wash station which is part of the all-inclusive package is phenomenal. The pricing is very fair for their luxury services. They even have an on-site mechanic and their own propane station. High-five"
3.5,4,"Very expensive. But, very clean. Some of the extra items don't work some of the time (RV wash, air pump (hose leaking) and water (hose threads stripped)) which can be frustrating. But at least they offer some conveniences that most places don't, when they work.  Staff that answers the phone and at the counter can leave a little on the table as far as courtesy, but I suppose that is the sign of the times. Also email and messages left with answering service for Bob, the manager, were never responded to, twice. Wish I could give it more stars, but the interactions with the office and site staff takes it down a star. Easy to fix. Hope they read this.

Update 1-2016: Now they don't accept payments online.  A major pain in the you know what. You have to call them to make a payment or snail mail it in. However, they did hire a friendlier person for the front desk. The rest of the people are still pretty grumpy though"
2.5,1,We rented from them. The delivery was 5 hours late. When the Airstream arrived it was filthy inside and out. There was a coat of dust of the countertops and the beds had loose metal screws in them. They never refunded my deposit and I'm not having to take them to court. Avoid these people and this company.
2.5,1,"I contracted with Retrorvs to replace 2 damaged panels on my 2010 Airstream.  After having my Airstream there for 5 months, they managed to not only mis-install the panels but also caused considerable additional damage.   I've gotten 4 additional estimates to repair the work accomplished by RetroRV and fix the additional damage caused by them. Estimates range from $21,000 to replace damaged components to $7,400 to return my Airstream to a serviceable condition.  I'm now taking my Airstream to a qualified Airstream repairer, Desert Autoplex, to repair the damage."
2.5,5,"This place is amazing and saved our butts while on vacation in our 1977 airstream minuet argosy.  
After our first night in goodyear, Husband filled our water tank and it leaked all over our electrical circuits causing it to burn and short.  No travelling rv place would help us since our trailer is vintage.  
We managed to get it hitched on our truck and took it to Retro Rv, where John and his team repaired all our electrical issues within a few hours for a very reasonable price and sent us on our way again to enjoy the rest ofnour trip.
We loved their service and knowledge so much that we decided well being it back next month for some updates."
3,1,"If you are going to drive like a complete asshole, it may be best to not have your company name and phone number on your truck."
3,5,"I had a regular customer bring his Yamaha golf cart into me for a slight tune up and some ""off-road"" modifications. I called up Cartz Parts and asked for a little help. The owner immediately said ""come on down and I will see what I can do"". Besides giving me the pages from the service manual and some suggestions on parts, his advice was great! I don't do much work on golf carts but if I ever do, this will be the place I get all of my parts. If you need work done, take your cart to this great establishment."
3,1,"Look out for their drivers using company vehicles. Also if you complain about drivers in the company vehicle, the manager has the same attitude. Bad safety & business practices, horrible customer service.

Threatening people who say something about it our leave a bad review? Horrible!"
3,5,"Very friendly and honest staff.   Helpful with battery selection.  Sales, parts and repairs for many brands of carts."
3,1,"I took my golf cart here to get a tune up and oil change. When I got my golf cart back it was smoking like crazy and leaking black oil all over. They told me the smoke was because some oil leaked when they were changing the oil. I took the golf cart back to have it looked at again because of the smoking coming out of the back of it and they told me my engine was blown. My golf cart was running just fine before I took it here and now after changing the oil allegedly, it leaks tons of black oil all over my garage. The smoke coming out of the back is horrible. This place has no clue what they're doing and I would not recommend taking your golf cart here because it will come out worse than when it went in"
3,1,This place is a rip off!!  Consumer beware. The owner claims he fixed things that he hasn't fixed.  He has a horrible attitude and customer service is a complete negative.
3,5,"I recently purchased a 2003 Club Car golf cart from a neighbor. The brakes squealed and the cart sagged on the left. It pulled left as well. I expected to have to replace the brakes, as well as some significant suspension work.
Sal at Cartz Partz sent someone to pick up the cart and quickly sorted it out.
They replaced the left rear leaf spring, cleaned and adjusted the brakes, gave it an overall service and delivered it back to me the following day. All for a very reasonable price.
Cart runs great, tracks straight, and stops on a dime.
Highest marks! Customer for life!"
3,1,Horrible company!!  Charged me 0ver $80 to put air in my tires!!   Don't go there!
3,5,"When a company provides exceptional service and always strives to ""go the extra mile"" for their customers, I feel the word must be spread and other people should know, hence this review: CARTZ PARTZ has been providing my elderly 94 year old father with golf carts at very reasonable prices for almost 20 years (he's gone through 3), and replacement batteries when needed at competitive prices. If you need a used cart or service, this is THE place to go in Phoenix. 

Yesterday, my father had an issue with his cart which suddenly stopped for no reason. He called them and in 20 minutes their guy came to see what the problem was. After taking the cart apart and realizing that 2 wires had fused together creating a short, he replaced the wires and fixed the cart (much to the relief of my dad) in about 15 minutes. When the technician called the office to ask how much he should charge for fixing the cart, they said it was on them, no charge.

In this day and age, and in our current MESS of an economy, when a company takes care of its customers in such a consistently respectful and HONEST fashion, they should be applauded and commended for doing the right thing.

I only wish more businesses were like this, our country would be a better place for it."
3,5,"These guys have done a great job for us. They replaced all the batteries in my EZ-Go RXV and when the batteries would not charge after some time, my fault for not using or charging the cart, they were able to swing by pick up the cart, charge it, test the charger and batteries and delivered it back to me like new. All for a very reasonable price. I am happy I have found them and look forward to more customizations from their shop."
4,5,Bought our first Airstream here from Phil.  He was patient and helpful pointing out pros and cons of small to large along with pointing out importance of different designs.  A very positive experience in purchasing our first Airstream!
4,5,"I can only speak to the repair and maintenance department.  I had just finished a trip from Michigan to Nevada and during the 11 day trip, our furnace wasn't working consistently.  I took it to the air stream dealer in New Mexico but they couldn't put their finger on exactly what was wrong.  They cleaned out the furnace and I continued on my trip.  Then the furnace continued to have problems several days later so I took it to Joseph at the air stream Las Vegas store.  He kept it for almost a week trying to recreate the problem of the furnace and was able to pin point the problem and fix it.  I am blown away by his customer service and the effort he showed in trying to figure out what the problem was.  I have never written a yelp review before but Joseph was so good, I felt like I needed to share my experience."
4,5,"They went up and beyond helping us make our new Airstream Interstate a reality. They gave us a fair price on our trade-in, and a great deal on our new coach.

Phil did a great job for us. Quick to respond and easy to get along with. Ask for Phil!!"
4,5,"Have been in the market for a high quality travel trailer for my wife and I, so after much searching and you tube videos, we decided to shop for an Airstream. Right out of the box we were treated extremely well, and given a wealth of information. Before we even got to the dealership we had been introduced to all the ins and outs of Airsteams. When we got there, we were able to see, touch, and experience all the options available to us. Long story short, we now have our dream trailer. And a special thanks, and double high five, to Gary and Sarah for making our purchase easy and enjoyable."
4,1,"OMG. Stay away from this Airstream Dealer. They area  new dealership  and don't have the technicians or staff to provide any customer service.  Its been 6 weeks since I purchased our airstream from this dealer and still don't know who financed the trailer. They also sold me an extended warranty and I have requested the information five times on email and still don't have any information. I guess I will have to hire an attorney to get what I need. You think after spending $70K on a 19'  trailer that the level of customer service would be the gold standard.  I won't even waste my time on the walk through items on the trailer. I am just having someone take care of it and pay out of pocket for now. On a positive note, we love the trailer but I would go to another dealer to purchase."
4,5,Went their to buy parts for y Airstream and they treated me kind and like I'm a part of the Airstream family. They have earned business for life.
4,5,"In regards to service, Joseph the service manager there is one of a kind, he's incredibly honest which as you may know is not a necessarily regular thing. We had a situation where we had to make a 500 mile drive which would have put us past 5 pm on a Friday and he was willing to wait for us and take care of a service call as a service manager after hours which is unheard of. On a couple other situations we had he got us out of there with caring and ease and was very upfront about everything, also a quality not necessarily linked to service. No hidden surprises, overall a great experience and if I was in the area I would always go there for regular maintenance and service."
4,1,"I stopped by the Airstream LV dealer to see if I could get a replacement part for my dump valve.  I didn't have my EB 27 attached to my tow vehicle and this is a very good thing because the parking situation is terrible.    It is an old car dealership and they have very limited parking for customers.   
First, while I was waiting for the parts guy to try to identify the part I needed online (he eventually tried to sell me the wrong handle and convince me I didn't know what I needed), I was looking around at their accessories.  Their prices are incredible.    For example, the exact mat you can buy at Walmart for $49 was selling for $81.99!   Everything else I saw was inflated by 50% over regal retail.   
Finally, another fine gentleman asked me if I was the guy with the big black truck and if I would move it before it was hit.   Funny, I had been there for 20 minutes at that point trying to get help without success and trucks were able to get by me just fine.   
Bottom line is I would avoid this place if possible.
My experience with Airstream dealers has been all over the map, but these guys did not impress."
4,1,"Customer service at its worst!! This place is a fricking joke! I spent $60,000 on a used RV,(3 months ago) at this place and my best advice to anyone is to stay away!! I signed 3 different contracts before they got it right, still didn't even know who financed the RV until 3 days before I'm supposed to start making payments and I finally get something in the mail from the finance company!! Never mind the fact they must have submitted my information to a dozen places without my knowledge. I've been trying for 3 months to get them to replace a DVD player that hasn't worked since day one, that still hasn't happened, but it's been promised multiple times! I was also convinced to purchase a warranty, I'm sure that will be a nightmare trying to use that for anything! I could go on and on, but I'll just say it again, STAY AWAY!! Never again......very disappointing!"
4,5,We had a great experience buying our pre-owned 2013 Airstream International Signature 23D from Phil and his colleagues at Airstream Las Vegas.  They rolled out the red carpet for us! We also received a solid recommendation to stay in nearby Boulder City for our first night and our salesman followed up with us to make sure everything was going smoothly which of course it was. Afterwards we grabbed a few drinks and left feeling like we made a new friend. This is what a buying experience should be!
4,1,"Just received the title for our Airstream, so I can finally let the public know of our experience at this dealership. Absolutely awful...very unprofessional and uncaring from the beginning to the end. You would think that when you are buying a quality product you would receive quality service from the top to the bottom, but this was not the case. We drove over 400 miles each way on the day we purchased the unit and again on the day we were to take delivery of the unit, incurring the cost of hotel and food, strictly because we wanted to purchase from this dealership. We were told it would take approx 2 to 3 hrs on the day we were to pick up our unit for a thorough walk thru and training session to be completed. To say we received a thorough training session would be a joke. The unit had not been carefully prepared and due to issues found, after over 8 hrs spent at the dealership, we finally told the sales manager we needed to leave and would come back the next day. We had taken the briefcase that contained the manuals back to the hotel and in the briefcase was the Bill of Lading, which documented a major flaw in the unit and was signed off by the LV Airstream dealership on the day they received the unit. We returned the next day and showed them the Bill of Lading and we viewed the defect. To be repaired it would have required that EVERYTHING in the unit be removed and a new floor had to be installed. We obviously, should have been made aware of the defect BEFORE any deals on this unit should have been made.  To say the least, we were very upset and requested our money back and to cancel the deal. Stupidly, we had given them a cashiers check for the full payment the day before and we were told, in no uncertain terms, LV Airstream would not allow us to cancel the deal. We were not happy but felt we had no recourse. After finally settling on a replacement for the original unit, it was a constant struggle to get communication from the general sales manager regarding every aspect of the completing the purchase.  The mental and physical strain on my husband and myself during this process was taxing. We are not rich people and have worked hard to be able to purchase a Airstream that we had dreamed about. I can only hope if you are thinking about purchasing a unit at this dealership that you receive better treatment then we did. Be forewarned...make sure you ask to see the Bill of Lading and you do not sign any paperwork or make a payment before you have a chance to do a THOROUGH walk thru of the unit no matter where you purchase your Airstream...."
4,5,"Bought my 2018 Airstream Interstate end of February 2018. My Sales rep Bobby was really excellent. No high pressure tactics, allowed me to take my time, and when we finally sat down to start the negotiations, we got to an agreeable deal very quickly. It also helps that I knew exactly what I was looking for, so the process went fast & smooth. Sarah Freeman, Sales & Finance Manager handled my loan very quickly, satisfied my strict request to not shop around my loan because I did not want dozens of hits on my credit. She concentrated on the best bank that fits my excellent credit. Even post-sale, Sarah has been very helpful and accomodating in helping me navigate the intricacies of gap insurance, standard warranty, & extended warranty options."
4,5,"Wow!  Top notch Airstream dealership!  Darren was able to squeeze us in to have a new air conditioner installed, under warranty.  They even repaired our door and drawer which was greatly appreciated.  Everyone that works there is friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.  Highly recommend!"
4,2,"Parts and service can't seem to coordinate, poor communication. Don't rely on these guys to get the proper part for your airstream."
4,5,"In April of 2018 we purchased our first Airstream Travel Trailer from Bobby Martino of Airstream Las Vegas.This wasn't our first RV purchase but it was our biggest, to date. We appreciated Bobby's patience and perseverance in getting answers to all our questions and concerns throughout the sales process, and we continue to appreciate his follow up with us as we begin to use the trailer we purchased. Two and a half months after our purchase, he still responds immediately to our calls. He continues to be an effective liaison between us and the Airstream service department."
4,5,Just purchased a basecamp and I couldnt be happier. Joseph and staff were awesome..thank you guys!
4,4,"Joseph, the service manager, was great to work with and he and his team did a good job on our warranty issues. He went above and beyond to accommodate our schedules and even allowed us to park our TV there while they were servicing our 27fb, though we did have our bikes stolen right off their lot.  We had a good experience with the service dept."
4,5,"Purchased our first airstream and couldn't have been more pleased with the service received from Lori in sales, Dave the general manager, Joe in service and the red carpet treatment in showing us everything regarding the airstream. Very responsive, friendly, and excellent customer service."
2.5,2,"The parking is easy and plenty of room But the place is run by ASSHOLES We made reservations and when we arrived we where 30 min early. The park only had a hand full of spots occupied, yet they made us park on the back of lot and wait until 2 o'clock. Then there were 7 other people at also had to wait so now at 2 there was a line that took 1 hr to check in. Also the park is out back of the hotel but they don't even offer a shuttle ,so at night you have to walk back through a dark parking garage in not the best part of town..."
2.5,4,"Amy and I stayed here on our honeymoon, passing through Vegas our way to the Grand Canyon.  It's a big parking lot, and on the pricey side, but Location Location Location.

It's the only RV park on the strip!

We walked to the Stratosphere through the litter of escort ads, past huge-but-seedy liquor stores and boastful arc-lit construction sites to ride the carnival rides on top of the Stratosphere, then stumbled home to bed."
2.5,3,"I agree with most of the reviews. The campground is not the greatest. However, it's quite possibly the ""only show in town"". I wouldn't be surprised if the entire grounds (including the casino which needs a MAJOR facelift) isn't there next time we pass through. If you enjoy the pleasure of your own clean Rv this is where you will find a ""spot"" to enjoy Vegas. A parking lot converted into Rv sites is what to expect. I believe there was a pool also. Can't comment on bath facilities as we are self-contained in our motorhome."
2.5,4,"This place a pretty nice. 
It have all you need for RV living. dog park and wash, propane fill, and a little convenience store. Ect. 

It's a 3 minute walk to the casino.

The park is pretty hard for taxis to find.

All in all a pretty nice stay."
2.5,3,"Not bad, all things considered. It's Vegas, so it's noisy and lit up all night. Circus Circus casino is a dump, but you're close enough to walk to nicer places. The RV park is much smaller than it used to be; they lost lots of land to the new MGM Events Center on the corner. No more shuttle service offered from the RV park. Restrooms are clean, dig walk is ok, nice new dump station, store has good supply of different stuff. RV hookups still antiquated and kinda difficult to work with, tho."
2.5,2,This was an okay RV park to stop for an overnight. Staff was not very accommodating.   We asked for one of the 3 available shaded spots and the staff claimed they were not available. We were even willing to pay more.  The entire day and night and morning of departure these spots remained empty.  Dog park was a joke. It was so dirty I wouldn't let my dog anywhere near it.  Just very run down.  Bathroom was okay for a shower but only because the room was air conditioned.   Felt relatively safe for a single night but didn't leave anything outside. Multiple exits to property which could be difficult to patrol.  Will be trying the koa if ever back in Vegas.
2.5,3,"The Wifi is a joke

Pros: on the strip close to the major casinos, Pool is nice, There is a small dog park, level spots, power, water and sewer works. rest rooms with showers. Pretty cheap for an RV Park on the strip.

Cons:
Wifi is a complete joke, I could not even get enough signal to login if with the supplied code. I tried 5 different access points (SSIDs), 3 different devices (Windows, Android, IOS), I few times I got the login page of the nearby Hilton hotel, the only time I got the RV's parks login it took 30 minutes to load the login page. once online i had 40% Packetloss.
The shelves are empty in the shop, 
They cannot register you at the ""registration office"" only check you in if you have a pre-registration, expect to be sent to the main hotel check-in via the Casino if you show up without a reservation. 
Restrooms feel worn and dilapidated. 
All camp spots are in direct sun all day, expect to run the A/C Non-stop.
Pool closes at 7:30pm. 
When we tried to reserve online the web-site had just been redone and wouldn't accept RV park reservations. I hope it has been fixed now."
2.5,1,This is the worst RV park in Vegas. WiFi doesn't work and all the bathrooms were broken. No shower in the men's bathroom and only one worked in the women's. Bathrooms were disgusting! After complaining for both days no one showed up to make needed repairs. The pool was closed and the hot tub drained. This park is completely mismanaged. Too bad because this could've a good park.
2.5,4,"Needed a quick overnight in Vegas and was pleasantly surprised by this facility. Drive through spot was plenty big enough for our 40' Monaco and slide outs.  Easy walk to the casino. In the morning I checked the place out. There's a place to let your dogs run, playground and pool area. Entire place is paved, we has full hook ups with 50 amp service. Would stay here again."
2.5,2,Where do I start... Well the park is a plain asphalt parking with some of the spaces having a couple of trees.  Bathrooms really are bad and they need to be upgraded.  Check out the photo with the bottom of the door rusted and rotten.  Now this did not happen overnight so the place has no maintenance all.  Around 5pm the swarm of helicopters start flying directly over your head for about an hour.  Non-stop flight traffic and very surprised to  find the entry location very difficult to find.
2.5,4,"I'm giving this place 4 stars because it's level,  clean and paved. Can't expect much more since your in the city and this is the ONLY RV park on the strip but a little grassy area would be nice. The pool area is great and we felt very safe walking to the casino. The Internet was super easy and excellent strength.  There is no cable but television reception was great with antenna. Also when we checked in the staff was very courteous. Just a side note, there was some construction in the park but it didn't interfere with our stay. The laundry facilities were reasonable and clean. $2 for wash $1.75 for dryer."
2.5,4,"We love this place and look forward to returning. In fact, the location was so perfect and the office staff were so great that we repeatedly extended our stay for a total of three months! Each employee was pleasant and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. They knocked on our door or left notes (if we were away) to let us know when we had packages or mail delivered. We had to go to the office, show identification, and sign for packages/mail to pick it up and they went to their back room to retrieve them; we appreciated knowing our mail was accepted and kept in a secure location (not just up front where anyone could have access). We were initially leery of the safety, based on some older Yelp reviews. It became immediately apparent to us, however, that security has been beefed way up after incidents in prior years. Security personnel on bicycles in bright yellow shirts patrol the entire park 24/7. When I mentioned to one of the security officers how much we liked seeing them out there, he told me at least one of them is stationed in the RV area as their ""district"" at any hour of the day or night. We returned at 2 am and 3 am sometimes and liked seeing security checking the restrooms and acknowledging what vehicles entered, such as the Uber/Lyft rides we took that were obviously not RVs. We felt 100% safe the entire three months we were here and none of the lawn furniture we kept outside were ever messed with. There are codes to enter the three restroom facilities on the property which you're given at check-in, so someone just wandering by can't get in. The restrooms were also clean and well maintained and appear to be cleaned throughout the day. One reason for less than five stars on here is the issue of the laundry facilities. During our entire three months here (January-April 2017), the laundry facilities were not operational. We were fortunate to have our own washer/dryer in our RV, but many were not and cut their stays short for this reason. This was unfortunate, because many nice people would have stayed longer. Another reason for less than five stars is that of the crappy wi-fi. Regardless of the time of day, it was unreliable. There is no reason for a business in this location to have as poor of wi-fi as this. We used our own hotspots the entire time we were there. 

Some things we've missed since leaving: hearing the screaming riders on the Stratosphere's Big Shot - it's entertaining AF. When traffic is light and you're listening for it, you can hear the screams when the ride ""launches"" while you're outside. You seriously don't need a TV when that's going on heh. Another is being close walking distance to El Dorado Cantina, that place has THE best Mexican food on the strip and it's just a stone's throw from the RV Park (on the Sammy Davis, Jr. side). The location in general is what we miss the most. If you're into walking the strip or to the Fremont area downtown, you can't do better than here."
2.5,1,"I have been staying here for 6 years off and on I must say this has been the worst trip ever. Upon arrival I was told that there were some issues in the park due to a water leak and the fact that they were sold out because of SEMA. I was offered an upgrade for free to a hotel room or they would set me up in a different RV park. No worries the space they had for me had water and power many didn't due to the issue. First day the bathroom near me was operating and I was satisfied at the cleanliness. Next day they took that bathroom off line so I had to walk across the park so I showered in my trailer. Arrived on Tuesday it's now Sunday I need to do some laundry so I go up to the main office area half the machines are broken ok not to bad nobody else washing. While I'm there the maintenance guy shows up to clean the bathroom at the main registration building so I think great fresh cleaned bathroom I'm going to shower. Hike across the park grab my stuff back to the bathroom there are 2 showers first one is missing a tile in the first row of wall tiles which also has a hole in the drywall so a 4""x4"" hole through the wall taking on water. Shower was nasty. Ok move to shower 2 looks pretty good so I get water to temp climb in close the curtain and look over my shoulder at the opposing wall to the entrance and it's black with mold!!!! The curtain is black!!!!! The clips holding the curtain is black with mold!!!! Disgusted and pissed I get dressed go into the office and demand to speak with a supervisor I want to show someone this filth I have paid $25 a day resort fees for!!!!! I am told supervisors won't come over I have to walk 1/2 mile to the hotel front desk to complain SERIOUSLY??? Finally got someone to get a supervisor on the telephone and was again told nobody would come over... Thank you for bringing this to our attention though we will reimburse you for two nights stay... I hang up the phone and the girl at the counter tells me she sent an email to engineering over s month ago to have the hole fixed...... WOW WTF??? Circus Circus needs to hire a management company to take care of this park it has gone down hill fast since KOA left the property this will be my last stay here for sure!!"
2.5,2,"This is for the RV Park part of Circus Circus. They get 1 star for location on the strip and 1 for the amusement park inside the hotel.
First impression- No gate or security at night. It's basically a parking lot that anyone can come right in.... and they do. 
After hours check-in is at the Hotel lobby which is quite a walk, otherwise check-in is at the circus tent looking building (I'll call this the Tent from now on), next to the pool area, their hours are from like 10 or 11 to 7pm. 
The Tent has a store, recreation area (billiards, air hockey, tv room, kitchenette), laundry, and bathrooms. The people working the store are not the brightest. One of the clerks was so deep in personal conversation with his visiting friend that he didn't bother to help the 3 people in line to pay for goods or check-in. We walked out after a few minutes of standing there waiting for at least an acknowledgement of our presence, that never happened. We ended up going to a grocery store to get what we needed.
 
The bathrooms. UGH, the bathrooms. *disgusted look* I wish I would of taken pictures. There are two bathroom buildings right on the lot and a set of bathrooms in the tent. On the women's side: Out of 6 showers, 2 worked. 4 of them had missing pieces; Nozzles with no shower head, no on/off handles for the water. One definitely had hot water (the one I ended up using in the tent and the only one that seemed to be cleaned daily), the other I didn't wait for the hot water, because I was already disgusted after having to literally fix the shower head that had fallen into pieces on the floor AND there was a smear of blood on the side of one of the doors.

Which brings me to the next point. They have security on bikes patrolling during the day. There was a lady who had wandered off the street, into the bathroom, and security had to shoo her out of there. I think she may have been shooting up in the bathroom, I don't know. 

The hot tub and pool are seasonal, so they were closed. We wanted to use a hot tub after being sore from walking the strip, so we called the front desk to see if they had a concierge that could hook it up. Nope, they don't have a concierge. No one knew anything about a spa with hot tubs there.

Don't even bother with the WiFi. It doesn't work. They don't have cable TV hook-up.
The dog wash, which is one reason we wanted to stay here, didn't work.
For the price we paid, it wasn't worth it. Find another RV Park in Vegas.
We won't be staying here again."
2.5,2,"Before we got to this RV Park we called ahead to find out what spot we were in so we could just pull up. They told us 11 so we got there and pulled up and started to hook up while someone went in to check us in. We were all hooked up and a different worker tells us that site is down because it is dangerous. So we move to a different spot. The next morning we wake up to another motorhome in spot 11 that was ""dangerous"". I am still waiting for the manager to come speak to me about this situation. I am not happy that in 102 degree weather I had to hook up, unhook, move then hook up again. 
The bathrooms are outdated but clean. The pool was dirty and water cloudy. It really was just a parking lot with hookups. The dog park had poop everywhere because no one cleans up after their dog. 
There was security riding around throughout the day.
I would NOT stay here again."
2.5,3,"Hard to find your way in - follow the arrows is quite the game if the arrows are faded out....

Pros - It's a level parking lot with RV hookups. It's sort of on the Strip. There was lots of space for the slideouts.

Cons - We were placed all the way in the back, with several open spots closer. There is no shade beyond a couple of trees by the front office. The pool at the rv park wasn't open but the main casino pool was and we were given passes to go there but why bother? We needed a shower just traversing the lot to get to the rv office. 

Tips for the Management - For the money charged to provide some water, electric and sewer for a night, don't be cheap. Open the pool."
2.5,1,I wouldnt stay at this place if i lived in a tank. Gotta love las vegas. Do whatever you want and the cops dont give a shit. Larceny over $250 apparently is not a felony here. Unbelievable. Place has no security whatsoever. Had 3 bikes stolen from me. Worth over $2000. And security and metro DO NOT CARE!!
2.5,1,"Posting to help other's as many use Yelp to be in the ""know"". This place is Terrible for the following
*The hike from this all concrete parking lot to the casino is crazy
*This all concrete lot is scary, like no security and any crazy can come and go 
*The facilities in this place is something from a crime scene
*The wifi is so damn slow that you can't even check e-mail and logging on the coupons for three devices is also a crazy process

Goto Oasis, it's much cheaper, secure and full of nice people. You will regret setting foot in this place especially for the price that you pay"
2.5,5,"Everyone was very helpful.  Bathrooms were clean and it was an easy hookup.  Parking sites were easy to find, level and easily accessible."
4,5,"We had a great experience renting an RV from El Monte in Henderson, NV.  We were happy to get a 2013, clean, perfect running RV.  Watched the video and were given a run down of how everything worked.  The manual they gave us for the trip was priceless, I referred to it many times during our trip and always found the information I needed.  The only slight glitch was we were told our insurance company didn't fax the binder information so I think we would have had to buy their insurance.  Luckily I had a copy with me so it worked out fine.  Next time I would not purchase the kitchen or personal kits, there was a lot of stuff that we really didn't need but since it was our first time renting an RV I really wasn't sure what I would need.  Now I know and I'll just bring it myself.  Drop off was easy, we were on our way within 15 minutes.  Definitely will rent from El Monte again!"
4,5,El Monte rv rental is by far the best place to rent an rv from. We had 3 couples in our group and 2 of them rented from Cruise American and had Ac issues and generator problems. We had no issues with the Rv and the people renting the RVS out are awesome. We will definitely rent from them again
4,5,Great experience renting the RV the staff was very helpful will be back for the next trip
4,5,"El Monte used to be amazing and I'm giving them a five star rating because they still have the best inventory. You can't find a Class A vehicle at their competitors. This being said, service used to be stellar and has gone downhill in recent years. Still, it remains the best in comparison to the alternatives and you will save quite a bit as opposed to purchasing your own and having to maintain it."
4,1,"Rented an RV for Burning Man....  we cleaned the RV thoroughly, then cleaned it again even more thoroughly at the drop off point and allowed them to inspect and reinspect after we cleaned.  Sure there was a little dirt.  No problems with the $200 cleaning charge.  the PROBLEM is the attitude.  You know what they said?  ""If you arent happy with that cleaning charge, we will charge you $1,000!""  Really?  Is that what you will do?  Not based on the condition of the RV but your own bitter attitude?  ooof...  not very good customer service.  We werent even complaining about the $200!  Good luck to you, El Monte, Las Vegas."
4,5,"We rented a 22"" RV from El Monte.  This was our first time renting from them.  The service when we rented was awesome on the pick up and return.  The RV was new, clean and everything worked.  This was the best RV experience we have had, our 4th time renting.  We will only go back to El Monte."
4,5,great service.  The RV was clean and ready on time.  Returning it was a breeze.  Will definitely use them again.
4,5,I have used this RV rental place a few times. Every time we have had a great experience. Stacey was very helpful and found me extra discounts to make the rental even cheaper. I will be using them again!
4,5,"We just got back from a one week 22ish foot RV trip out of Las Vegas to the SW Utah national parks. Our experience with El Monte from start to finish was fabulous. I booked directly with them rather than online and got the less expensive rate since the per mile rate and free miles were better as was the customer service. We got a 2013 model which was sparkly clean and in great running order. The video briefing and explanatory walk through was very helpful (this is our second rental ever). Sandra was our friendly helper, both on the phone and in person. She greeted us with a smile and outfitted us with all our needs for the trip, down to the coffee pot, toaster and lots of warm blankets for the high altitude cold weather. The customer service was extremely friendly, relaxed and accomodating from start to finish from everyone. The rig drove great with the exception of the passenger mirror which did not hold in place (we told them about it afterward and they were appreciative). Everything was in great working order and it was comfortable for our family 3 person family. We forgot some things in the RV and when I called the next day after we flew home to WA state, Sandra went right out to the RV and found exactly what we had forgotten, and then I spoke to Charles (the very friendly gentleman who shuttled us to the airport)---who remembered us from the day before and then said he would personally ship the stuff to us at no cost. We would definitely rent from them again."
4,5,We had a pleasant experience renting an RV from El Monte. Stacy at the front the front desk was very nice and helpful. The RV itself was the newest model and we had zero issues on our 17 day trip to the Bay Area. Will definitely recommend El Monte to whomever ask us about RVs and this location will be our number one choice whenever we want to rent one in the future.
4,5,"We rented an RV for the first time ever and El Monte RV did a wonderful job! Now we're hooked! There are so many positive things I'd like to mention that I'm not sure where to begin? The overall process to rent an RV was much easier than we expected and much more affordable than we anticipated.  The staff were very helpful in explaining everything and going over the paper work and contract. For familiarization to the RV, they have an online instructional video as well as an instructional manual to take with you for any technical operational reference, including a helpline and roadside assistance if needed. It makes you feel reassured in the event of the unexpected.  The RV itself was probably a 2010 model and was well maintained.  Everything worked flawlessly except for a circuit breaker that needed to be reset. It was so convenient having everything at your fingertips;  a fridge, stove, oven, a/c, microwave,  bathroom with shower,  a bed, generator,  etc. This is definitely the way to travel!  Plus, they are Pet Friendly,  thus making our trip even more memorable by allowing our fur kids to come along and not have to board them! In summary, we thoroughly enjoyed our RV vacation and want to thank El Monte for helping out with a wonderful trip!"
4,5,We had a great experience here. Staff was very helpful for first time renters. We are renting again from this location this summer.
4,5,"We had a bad experience trying to rent an RV through RVShare which got cancelled the day prior to our departure to a 6 day trip to see the national parks. Last minute we were able to get one from El Monte. Stacey at the office was wonderful to get everything organized last minute. Called us several times to keep us up to date on when we can pick up the RV. The check-in on a Sunday and drop off on a Saturday were super easy. We were the only renters at both days and there was no waiting at all.  Stacey was super helpful and friendly. A great experience. Highly recommend this location. RV was fine too, no issues on our trip."
4,1,"El Monte RV Rentals & Sales located on Las Vegas Blvd is where we rented an 8 passenger 2019 class C RV for 5 days. While doing the walk-thru there was just one employee. She was overwhelmed with other customers and phone calls and wasn't able to thoroughly perform our walk thru. Apparently,  a water leak and a slow leaking tire overlooked. We also had to stay 45 minutes after closing just to check out. While driving to our first destination, we COULD NOT use the water because it leaked throughout the whole RV. That means our 90 year old grandparents could not use the restroom, we had to make numerous stops, we could not shower or wash our dishes. To add to the fire, as we parked our rv we noticed a flat tire! We Called El Monte and they said they would gladly fix it and reimburse us the expenses. We wasted about half a day waiting for the person to come and fix our tire. The next day, El Monte wanted us to bring our entire family to a place to service the water problem. We told them we needed someone to come to us because we were not going to waste another day waiting around in a service area so they sent a mobile service. Driving home, the engine was so hot, the driver got a blister from hot air blowing on her foot (mind you she was wearing shoes). We get back to El Monte on south Las Vegas Blvd and Stacy, the employee working, basically says sorry for what happened but we cant compensate you for lost time because ""you refused to stop somewhere to get the water serviced"". We paid an extra $130 for insurance which did not even cover a flat. We got charged an additional $156 to repair the tire. If we knew the insurance wouldn't over a flat, we could've just called AAA ourselves to fix the tire. Stacy at El Monte has horrible customer service because she was basically arguing with us! She said we could not have a copy of the damages she wrote and corporate would review the telephone calls but wouldn't notify us of their decision and that it was our responsibility to call and see for ourselves. Stacy just made the situation worst, taking it to a personal level saying that she was in fact fair for charging us full price plus charging us for the damaged tire. She called her manager and the manager never came out once to try and problem solve.  Btw, the driver had to go to the emergency after we dropped off the vehicle to treat her burn and added another $130 to this mess. She had to receive a tetanus shot too. 

We basically paid a hefty price for a broken RV and no understanding from the company whatsoever. Save yourself the trouble and rent from somewhere else. They do not value people's business when we were treated such a way. Expensive vehicle, bad customer service and bad business overall."
4,5,"Recently rented MH for trip to Moab. I called in the morning regarding pick up time and was told since this is off season I could pick up NOW. What a bonus that was because we had a long way to go before nightfall. The MH was clean, Sandra explained everything we needed to know and off we went. Have rented several times from them and this was the best experience ever! Highly recommend this rental."
4,1,"This company's Las Vegas office is staffed by incompetents and thieves.  We were shown one RV and rented a different one...at the same price as the first; they didn't remember to send us off with a sewage hose and left the drainage valve open; they didn't clean the fridge...we were first timers and didn't even know the difference.  We do now!

They also have a ""leave it/lose it"" policy on stuff left in the RV when you turn it in.  In other words, if you leave it, they take it.  We left 4 camp chairs in the understorage and 24 hours later, when we called to reclaim them, only 1 was found.  Now, the smart thief takes all 4 so no trace is left, but they took the three adult chairs and left the kid size chair...so we know we packed them.

Then, adding insult to injury, they don't take customer complaint calls at their customer service phone line...instead, they steer you to a recorded message that tells you how to complain by mail or on their website...which will take up to 60 days to follow up on.

I will not go away that easily...trust me"
4,5,"Love El Monte RV always acomadating, helpful and price comparable.  Will always go to El Monte for ALL my Rv needs."
4,1,"Upon arriving at the El Monte RV Agency in Las Vegas, we noticed there were several people waiting outside, not to mention 2 large overflowing garbage receptacles and garbage all along the curbsides. As we entered, to sign in on the clipboard, we noticed even more several dozen miserable faces   
Now, let me explain that I called TWICE to check what time would be best for us to come in. As we had flown into Vegas from NJ and had to check out of our hotel to catch an expensive cab ride. The nice El Monte lady explained that our reserved RV was 'received and clean but was waiting for final inspection'. Not once did anyone mention that we would have a wait time. And believe me, we are pretty patient people, considering we have 3 kids and understand what it means to have patience. 

We waited. Then waited some more.  Then we waited for....drum roll please....6 hours!!!!! Let me spell that for you....SIX HOURS!!!!
Finally, our name was called! We sign our lives away, spent the equivalent of buying a small island and watched the sales lady give her co-worker the number of our reserved RV so he could bring it to the door for us. 
We watched the frazzled employee explain that he could not find our RV. I repeat, could NOT find our RV. 

They calmly decided to 'just give them RV number so and so' and maybe we will be on our way.  
Well, not so fast because our story doesn't end there. Knowing our RV had to have a 'final inspection', it never occurred to us to ask the well trained and competent El Monte employees if this random Class A RV had been properly inspected as well. 
Thankfully, someone had a trained eye to notice the dump tanks were not emptied, and the propane tank wasn't filled, or we would be driving with someone else's shit. Literally! But we are happy to report that if the bathroom door gets left open, the entire cabin stinks like crap. (And none of us have had the pleasure of 'stinking' it up ourselves. 

This facility had absolutely no direction, no leadership and no communication with their customers whatsoever. 

One crooked bed, one tilted couch, filthy floors and dusty counters, a crappy smelly cabin, a non working radio, an air conditioning unit that will only work in half of the vehicle, one exterior storage unit door that would not stay shut and had us pulling over 3 times and finally stopping for duct tape and we are finally able to say, we are on vacation! Oh, and we still have 2 1/2hrs until we arrive at our first campsite at midnight. 
You have been warned."
2,1,This dealership is horrible... There service department takes forever to take care of your rv... They don't return calls.  Not to mention I was told by a tech not to leave  any valuables in my rv because of theft there... I dropped my rv off in beginning of August and still have not gotten it back and it is the end of September.
2,5,"People usually write bad reviews and once we read the reviews we were leary about leaving our 5th wheel with them. After the service we received we felt compelled to write a good review. Excellent service!!! We bought our 5th wheel somewhere else. We took it in to camping world for some warranty work. They had it for a little over a week and they addressed all our problems, documenting our issues and their resolutions. David and Jake really took care of us. Everything is working perfectly. Kudos to them. I would highly recommend their service department. Thanks again."
2,5,"WOW,  We purchased a Motor Home from John a couple of weeks ago, what an excellent experience, the unit was used and we had some concerns.  John, and Paul went over and above in helping us out, they took care of things we didn't even ask for.  John constantly kept in contact with us, even after the sale.  

We returned to Camping World a few days later for a few things, we met again with John and Paul, they treat us like we are their only customers.

Then we met Jack, we put our other rig on consignment, what a super job they have done to show this, we are so pleased.  We have had more from this experience than expected.  Thank you, thank you Camping World, and all who helped us, WE'LL BE BACK  !!"
2,2,"I enjoyed all the variety of selections of RV's to see but we unfortunately got salesman Toby who I did not like at all! I have had a lot of experience with salesmen in my life and he was the worse. No personality. Very to the point of being arrogant, cocky and pretty sure of himself not in a good way! I would go back but, never want to deal with him again!"
2,1,"Tried to buy a new $300K motor home here today, but walked away disgusted with their misleading sales tactics and total failure to negotiate in good faith. This is the second time we've been here and we should have learned from the first time. This dealership holds out for maximum profits and is deceptive. Watch out!"
2,1,"Typical sales lot. Lots of promises from the sales team up front and buyers remorse when it comes time to use something you paid for. Bought a 2017 Coleman trailer 2 months ago with the extra warranty because I knew I did not want to come out of pocket when something goes wrong on our NEW trailer. 
        Took it out this past weekend for its very first trip and the toilet valve is leaking from the back of the toilet. Jammed a towel in there to make it thru the weekend and was not the least bit worried since I purchased such an AMAZING warranty. Called over to the service this morning to schedule to drop off my trailer for repair before our next trip at the end of this month.  To my surprise it will be 3 weeks before they will have an available spot to look at my trailer. July 10th was the first available appointment! Asked for the service manager and received a sorry there are other people in front of you! My question for him was ""What if I was on the road would you just turn me away?"" I was told we do our best to address LPG leaks and urgent issues before we tell you to keep driving!  How about you hire a few more mechanics if you have so much work backed up! Having to wait 3 weeks for them to look at my BRAND NEW trailer that is leaking is beyond unacceptable! I would advise against doing business with Camping World or at least this branch of the company. What a joke!"
2,5,"This company is super customer service oriented.  Ask for Sten, he is your guy.. Inventory is very complete"
2,1,"Don't be a sucker and find somewhere else to buy your RV. Bought ours here in September 2016, from day 1 it had a warped and cracking table. It is now February 2017. After way more back and forth than there ever should have been to get a new table top, finally get a call that it is in, only to drive across town to exchange it and get told there is no one here that knows anything about it. Their service is horrible! I have wasted about 10 trips here over a table top. God forbid I have anything serious go out like the AC or fridge or something, would probably takes years to get it fixed at this rate. I would give zero stars if I could. We're sorry we bought an RV here and wish we would have gone somewhere else."
2,1,"The worst salesman ever. Rude, condescending and a smart mouth. Please do yourself a favor.  Do not get a trailer from them."
2,2,"Stopped by today at 4:30, they close at 5. At about 5 minutes to 5 we were looking at RVs we were thinking of purchasing and our salesman said it's 5 time to leave. He also told us had a 50% down payment was required on any RV, that seems exceptionally high. I'm hoping it was just a salesperson because he got some really nice deals."
2,1,"I purchased a high end Class A used diesel pusher from this Camping World in April 2011. I was upgrading from a Class C gas motorhome to this big diesel pusher. I knew very little about these larger motorhomes and kept asking lots of questions of the salesman, sales mgr, service mgr, ""diesel specialist"" salesman & location GM. 

My biggest question had to do with what sort of fuel mileage I could expect. They ALL told me that I could expect to get 10-12+mpg. Well, after driving it for 2 years, at 55 mph MAX,  in all kinds of terrain, the motorhome averages 6 mph. Downhill, totally empty with the wind it might get 7mpg MAX. If they were just estimating the mpg for me, I might chalk up their bad advice to their IGNORANCE. However, unbeknownst to me when I bought the RV, it has a computer which tracks mpg of trips and for the life of the RV. It has averaged 6mpg before I bought it and after I bought it! So when I was asking all these RV specialists, not one of them showed me the computer and previous mileage history. They ALL continued to give me TOTALLY WRONG info. 

Either they are ALL totally ignorant- not knowing about the computer, which is std on big diesels, or they LIED to me. I know which one I think they are.

Needless to say I will NEVER buy anything from them again and I highly recommend you DO NOT do business with this group of liars.

I give the 1 star only because the system won't allow 0 stars."
2,4,Great service and very friendly! Helped us out while we were in Vegas for a week. Fixed our issues and got our rig back at the promised date. The actual retail store is small and dated so don't expect the normal huge Camping World store.
2,1,"Dropped our RV off on July 26 for warranty repair after waiting 5 weeks to get our RV in. Was told it would be several days before getting to it.  As of today (August 4th) nothing has been done. We waited 10 days to hear something only to be told that we got our RV pulled out of the service bay because of a emergency repair for somebody else. We called several times and nobody returned our calls.  Finally had to go down there only to be told that they are still waiting for our warranty to be approved.  Was tired of hearing nothing, called again.  Told it will be weeks till warranty is approved.  So we called Fleetwood and they told us that Camping World didn't even submit for approval until August 2nd and they gave them the approval August 4th.  So not only did we get the approval within 2 days (not weeks) we called again only to be told now that it will be weeks before they can work on it.  They told us that we fell out of line.  How do you fall out of line when you bring your RV in to be worked on, it's there and now we have to wait for who knows how long? We were in line and they pulled us out of line because of somebody else? Horrible customer service.  Ed was rude on the phone and we still don't know what is going on.  He didn't seem to care the money that we have spent there in the last couple months.  We have been good customers (and patient).  Now we have to drive down there again and find out what is going on?  Will never do business with this establishment again.  Poor customer service, no return of phone calls & rude!"
2,1,"The reason for my last review is that repairs take weeks to complete.  On my last visit which the coach was in the shop for 6 weeks I spend nearly 10,000 and  I 
asked to have air pressure checked while it was still in the bay. The service writer said sure it's about $ 26.00    I was speechless!!!!!"
2,1,"Mike,
 
Please bear with me while I rant...   I too am in the Las Vegas customer service industry and know how very important a business reputation is, how potential business growth or decline is affected, how communication can either make a customer experience wonderful or guarantee an unhappy event.  I'm very aware that problems are inevitable, but it's how those problems are addressed, solutions provided, and rectified that matters most.
 
I had hoped to have heard something by now after yet another unpleasant experience with Camping World Service department on Saturday10/3/15, but still no word of any plan of action to rectify the situation.
 
I purchased a 230k Coach from the Camping World Franchise, and was sold on the idea from Camping World, Longmont Colorado, that the large benefit was the company had many service centers throughout the United States ensuring any issues or warranty items would be efficiently and professional addressed.
 
I purchased this unit July 3rd and immediately drove it from Longmont to Las Vegas.  I called Longmont with our initial issue list in July and was directed to work specifically with Ray at the Las Vegas location.  I gave Ray this list and made an appointment in July to drop the unit off for repair.  It is now October, and still initial warranty PRIORITY ITEM #1 seat station SEAT BELTS MISSING HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED or any information communicated regarding unresolved complaints.   When I initially notified Longmont Colorado immediately of this in July, they stated there should be 4.
 
I was told both in July, August and September that parts needed to be ordered, and it was Camping World's preference that I had the ability to use my 
coach in the interim.  So I drove my 230K coach around missing seat belts, a refrigerator that doesn't stay shut, inoperative entry steps, and a driver generator status that doesn't work, in addition to 8-10 other small items on the work orders. Of the 3 months I've had this Coach, it's been sitting at Camping World service center for over 1/3 of the time.
 
Parts that were supposedly ordered came incorrectly at the mistake of the Vendor..  After the second time the incorrect parts were ordered or delivered , I demanded that counter to counter delivery, at the expense of the parts distributor be responsible for the mistakes that should be assessed.
 
After the second appointment was made for 8/24/15, the parts were supposedly on hand so I could drop the unit off and get everything completed by Sept 3rd so I could utilize it for Labor Day weekend.  Unfortunately My business obligations(customer service) took priority and I couldn't make the trip and advised that since the unit still wasn't complete there was additional time.  After 3 weeks of this coach sitting at Camping World, You and I had agreed this was unacceptable, and I was assured the situation and all associated items listed on the work order would be complete for an Oct. 2nd delivery... OVER 30 days since I had left the unit with Camping World!
 
 Saturday, I arrived and the unit was pulled up front:
 
#1       The generator compartment was not secured..  I attempted to lock and a large black support of some type fell to the ground.
#2       The fridge lock was the same that I put together from Lowes that I left in a drawer. Had not been replaced with a missing original factory part from delivery.
#3       CW tech (supposedly) advises that Winnebago states the dash indicator showing generator hour use is not ""wired from factory""
#4       CW tech (supposedly) advises that Winnebago states the seat station #1 at the dinette is not a station that has seat belts of which seat 2,3,4 of the same dinette all have seat belts installed.  ( I previewed 3 other identical units that all had safety belts installed at all 4 dinette seating stations)
 
Unfortunately, because of the lack of effective communication, makes it hard to feel confident in anything I'm being told is completely accurate.
Needless to say that unless these items are specifically and immediately addressed, my opinion and concerns with this situation will not be resolved to my satisfaction!  
At this time, I'm merely & adamantly requesting immediate attention to rectify the above addressed concerns. 
 
Please respond accordingly with an appropriate plan of action, a timely response is expected.
 
Best Regards,
Rick C. Williams

Follow up:
Good Morning Matt,

Thank you again for your immediate response, professionalism & attempted assistance on Monday. Clearly your voicemail was either not received or completely disregarded.

Another week has passed...  Mike Hulsey contacted me Monday after my first email, & agreed the miscommunications & delays were unacceptable..  He assured me he was working Monday to get the last issues resolved...

But NOTHING!!"
2,2,"Upset with them.  Bought a 2016 Freedom Elite in August. Took it on its maiden voyage as instructed and found some items which needed fixed.  Took the list to them and was told they can only fix 10 items at a time!!!!  This was a brand new RV!  After much discussion they said they would fix them.  This was the end of August as of today January 17th...we do not have our RV back yet!   We call and call to talk with service... Sometimes they call us back, sometimes they don't.   For new RV owners we are very disappointed!!!!   If we were asked would you buy an RV from Camping at this point in time, I am afraid it would not be a very positive response."
2,5,"I've read the reviews and I have to disagree. I had my RV serviced at the Las Vegas store. They are slammed with work and a mistake or something might slip by. I brought it  to my service supervisor MIKE's attention and he went out of his way to get things right. It takes time but squeezing someone in to correct an issue I would expect no less. 
I have spent some time there and watching and listening to the 2 service supervisors work, I think those guys do the best I've seen in awhile. Never upset. Always showing concern. Even when I rib em they still smile. 
Thank you Mike for everything you have done. I hope your there for a long time to come."
2,1,"Horrible service. Took my trailer in for a wheel bearing repack, estimate 400 
Dollars. Also wanted tires. Service writer Brad wouldn't give me a quote on tires as ""prices change all the time""  Got a call from Brad, the estimate was now 1750.00 as the bearings were dry, the brake linings were flaking and the hubs wear required replacement.  The 1750 quote did not include tires.

Asked to see the parts that required replacement while the trailer was still in the bay.  Brake linings were fine, bearings were not dry, and the hubs were serviceable.  Brad suggested that the brakes had been too tight.  I told him that they were the last ones to service it, but got no response.

As for the tires, they wanted 550 for a brand I didn't want and could get the ones I did want at Discount Tire."
2,1,"I have been taking my 2017 5th Wheel in for warranty issues.  Every time I have gone there, with an appointment it takes them at least 2 weeks repair minor issues and the parts were there.  I go in to check on it and every time it is sitting in the back and they never touched it!  Unfortunately I have had to take it in 3 times for different issues and the same timeline.  It takes me to go there and complain to get anything done.  The latest issue was caused by them, detailer sprayed chemical on fenders and the buffed swirls on the side and ruined the decals.  Poor communication, poor customer service and quality of work is so so.  I would highly recommend going elsewhere."
2,1,"I wish we read these reviews before we bought a used travel trailer from Camping World. When we got it home we realized there was a noticeable sized soft spot in the floor that they had to have known about. It wasn't hidden. We called to make an appt since we paid for the warranty. It took months to even get an appt. In the meantime we has a little run in with a couple of trees in a small area and the front got pulled back a bit so we went through insurance to fix it at the same time. They however totaled it out mainly because the cost to fix it was so high considering we were sold a camper that was completely rotted out underneath. Even though we had a warranty they considered it a pre existing condition, Which I would have understood if we didn't buy it FROM them in that condition. We had to pay a large sum of money because it was totaled and didn't have gap insurance. After calling continually and obviously furious they didn't seem to care they sold us a rotted, probably completely unsafe to even be in camper, the manager made it seem like they would right their wrong. He made it sound like they'd help us pay that gap and get us in a new camper. In reality, they wanted us to overpay for a camper and would use their profit to help pay it. Spending 10 years overpaying on a camper doesn't seem like much help. At the end of the day, they could care less about selling us an unusable trailer. I was told ""if you buy a camper as is, drive it off the lot and it falls into 1000 pieces, you own those 1000 pieces."" Great motto for a place of business.   This place doesn't care about anything but a sale and they've made that obvious. I felt safe buying through what I thought was a reputable company, but I would have been better off spending less and buying off of Craigslist. We lost over 6K in a matter of 6 months with that piece of junk they sold us. STAY AWAY!"
2,5,Took my 5th wheel in to have satellite dish installed. I was told by another source it would only be 3-4 hours. I dropped off the trailer a day before My appointment which was for a Friday at 8am. We were leaving Las Vegas the next day. I was informed it would be an 8 hour job. Robert Stringer was the technician that was looking my situation over. He said if he could get it in the shop Thursday it would be done Friday afternoon.  Hector Davila checked with shop manager and was able to get it in the shop. My trailer was completed Friday afternoon. Not only the dish installed but a new TV swing arm bracket too!  I appreciate the great work and help that both Robert and Hector did to get me in and out and keeping my schedule. Thank you to both of them and all at Camping World of Of Las Vegas.  I will be returning when I need work again.
2,1,"The other negative reviews about this place are right on point. The employees act like they are doing you a favor when asking for help. Advertised item wasn't available at the LV Blvd location. Was told it was only sold at the Boulder Hwy location. Drove across town and the item was not available there either. You might think that before telling a customer an item ""is available"" you might pick up the phone and check but this guy was to busy talking to his buddy. This place spent money advertising an item and then it is not in stock- real geniuses."
2,1,"Attention, they actually try to scam you.
I was an absolute beginner last March when I bought my first motorhom ever - a used one from a private seller. I tried to do it the save way and drove with the motorhome to Camping World to let them check some thdo a pre-buying check. It came out that they told me all the brakes are really in bad condition and should be replaced immediately or I will have a bad accident. They wanted to install new brake pads and new rotors, making it a 1300$ bill. I returned to the seller, he was confused, said the breaks should be fine. We had a little bit of an argument and did not stay friends in the end, he went down with the price a few hundred $, feeling bad at me, and I felt I paid too much. Anyway I decided not to do the repair at Camping World, because they are so slow there doing their work, I decided to do it later, eventually when the brakes start to make some noise. Was driving for 3 months, nothing happened. Was driving 10.000 Miles, nothing, brakes are fine. 8 Months later I finally thought myself that these breaks might be at their end now. I made an appointment at a small brake shop (P&O brakes in Las Vegas) - he had a quick look and said: Well your breaks are still fine, the are not even half used. Maybe one pad on the back is thinner, but still no problem.
So - what on earth was the Camping World  staff talking about 8 months ago? Why do they lie to their first time customers?
I really would never go there to do a repair. I know, many people go, their service lane is always full. These people have too much money to spend. Small business are much better, you talk to reliable people, you get a better price, you do not have to talk to a lady at the front desk which does not have any clue about where your motorhome is at the moment and if it will take another 5 minutes, 5 hours or 5 days. I remember that only calculating the price of the brake repair took them 1 hour. What a waste of time."
2,1,"Bought a Thor Class C on March 15th, 2018. Returned on May 1st to have some warranty work done. Simple things like diagnose the AC that was not cold, repair slide out seal, misc. loose wiring and sink not draining due to defective vacuum cap. One week to evaluate, three weeks to get warranty approval from Thor, three weeks waiting for parts and unknown when it will be worked on. & weeks in shop to date. No updates are provided.
Service Dept staff lack credibility and do not present themselves as professionals.
Also, this product has a great chassis and engine, but the Thor product is extremely poor quality. Planning to sell as soon as I can, take the loss and look for better quality."
2,5,I have had very good customer service in the parts department at this Camping World. Phil in the store has been very helpful in getting generic parts for my trailer and Tresia in the OEM Parts department has been a good liaison with Forest River on specific parts for my r-pod. I would use them again and recommend them for parts.
2,5,Great people to work for they found what I was looking for at the price I could afford everything went smooth from A to Z my salesman was very helpful the instructions that I received on how to use my Class C everything was smooth everyone was helpful everyone was friendly it was a great place if you want one on one Professional help look for Mr Hunt he was he was my salesman the other salesmen were great friendly and helpful even though they were not my salesman they all work together as a team great job guys the receptionist in the front kept me and candies
2,5,"We have nothing but great things to say about Camping World. We just purchased our second trailer from them.  John and Mike in sales are both knowledgeable and easy to work with. Never once did we feel pressured into a sale. Both were more than willing to go above and beyond helping us purchase the right RV even making sure we had the correct tow vehicle and equipment so we were safe.

Joe, Hector and Oscar in the service department have always been fantastic to work with. Sometimes even giving us tips to fix issues ourselves to prevent a trip to the shop. 

Joe in finance was also great to work with. Taking his time to explain all our options and add ons and not getting frustrated if we turned one down or asked a million questions. 

If you are in the market for an RV or need any service done on yours, you will not be disappointed in camping world."
2,1,"You have be certain you pay attention when you buy from them.  They  are liars. Last Saturday I was there to buy my father an RV.  We had Toby as a sales rep. We looked at used and figured for a little more we could have new.  We found the Dutchman Atlas, it was perfect for dad.  When we sat and talked about the price the bullshit began.  First they came with $340 for 120 months with 20k down. I told it was not a good deal. After looking online, when my sales guy was in the magic room of BS, I found they were around the $37500.00 mark. When I asked Toby about the price he said their price included everything-set up, sales taxes, everything out the door.  At that point I felt it was a great deal but I still had to work on the payment.  He said make us an offer and I will try. I offered 15k, 1k for the trade in $290 a month for 120 month.  In my head my math was $50,800.00. I was told give me a credit card let me show them you are serious.  Toby came back and shook my hand for the deal.  The ran my card for $5000.00 and they set me up with finance on Tuesday. When I sat down with Joe it was a whole different story.  I purchased extra warranty and coating protection. I knew the price was going up but I was still alright with the price.  When it came time for the loan docs the loan said 180 months.  NOT WHAT WE AGREED UPON!!! I was quite upset but I really couldn't do anything.  I already gifted the RV to my dad and he was so excited. I didn't want to let him down.  Thank God I am in a position that I can buy it outright. If I paid the  terms according to the contract I would have to pay over 76k. CRAZY.      WATCH THESE THIEVES... Joe by the way you were way off.....  Remember the 11%  interest rate that you said was normal for this?? Got a letter from the Bank they changed it to 6.24%.   UNREAL, NEVER AGAIN AND I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO MY WORST ENEMY.....


BY THE  WAY- Nothing we talked about in the 5th was fixed, Table was still broken,  Fireplace doesn't work, chair is broken YOU DID NOTHING AS PROMISED!!!!"
2,2,"delivered the 5th wheel on the wrong property without the ac and keys.  
They had to come an take it all the way to Las Vegas from California to install the ac and switch the sticker back to the original sales price.  
Now I can't open the bathroom door bc the a/c is in the way.  
Also the guy delivering the RV who isn't even one of their normal drivers hit my fence knocking it off of the cement and cracking the cement.  
It's been a month.  My first payment is due tomorrow.  No one will answer my calls.  I've called and emailed mike hulsey who is supposed to help me within 30 days.  Still no call back.   No email back. He said he would help me but He obviously is avoiding me.  I still have no access to my RV.   I'm basically homeless because of camping world.  I've document everything with pictures.    If anyone can help.  Please send legal recommendations. 

I've put in several complaints to corporate. Contacted the BBB.  Not sure if there's anything else I can do.  I'm currently seeking legal assistance.    
Please don't let these crooks steal from you.  There's 10 million other RV places you can go who will be honest.

I have updated this review.  The CSTeam has really been helping me try to resolve my issues.  Thank goodness for them.   We are still tryin to get the issues resolved but things are looking like they are moving forward."
2,5,"Stopped here today to get a replacement for a vent cover that blew off on our way to Utah from Southern California. Wasn't too impressed at first. Went in and talked to Phil, no help from him. Started to leave and then talked Josh. What a help Josh was! He is the best representative they have!"
2,1,"I am sorry that we purchased our RV through Camping World. We love the RV, but the service department is horrible! They either gouge you or ignore you! 
Recently our satellite would not retract and we were charged $125 dollars for them to tell us that we just needed to hold the button in longer! 
My husband took the unit down to have service done on the generator. Despite the fact that we had an appointment made for this weeks ago he was told they might not be able to get to it that day! He told them he didn't need it that day and could pick it up the next day. They told him they would call when it was finished. That was Monday. He called yesterday (Black Friday) and no one answered. He called today and was told that it had not been serviced yet! No excuse for this! 
If I could give negative stars to Campingworld's service department I would!"
2,2,"Arrogance, uppity attitude displayed by the sales people at this particular Camper World location is phenomenal. You think that their sh**doesn't stink. They can't  answer questions in complete sentences, because you're supposed to be able to understand exactly what they're talking about. If they make a mistake on a part, it's simply a shrug a laugh and a comment of ""oh well sorry dude."" They don't stock very many parts, their prices are over the top. There is one female at the counter who isn't The Brightest Bulb in the box, but she's very very nice, and very helpful. Although she had to call for two different people to answer a relatively straightforward question, at least she tried,. One of the guys she called over was too cool speak a word to me, the customer, walk back to the wall grab something, and threw it on the counter, and walked away. Perhaps I should say he started away, as though he was very proud that he was the man, who help the customer without saying a word? Perhaps I should feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to be in their presence?"
2,1,"I would like to know what happened to all the horrible reviews this company has received on Yelp.  They are all gone including mine.  The latest of my camping world saga is that my Dash Air went hot again for the 5th time in Three years.  Yes Camping world did the repairs 
 every time.This time I had it repaired in two days some where else  and it blows colder than ever did when I got it back from Camping world.  Never gain will I go there and I don't know why they are so busy with all the bad reviews."
2,1,"This is the worst Camping world that I've ever been to and I've been to allot of them that I've lost count.  I decided to buy a trailer and Mike Walsh was the sales person.  It must had been my unluckiest day ever to have Mikes name up next as the sales person.  The sarcastic egotistic man needs to pull his head out of somewhere bad.  Then once I decided on what I wanted to buy, I had to deal with Mr Ashtray Paul in finance.  Paul the Finance Managers office smelt like everybody just got done with a smoke-out in his closed office.  I got home still choking.  Gag!!!  But what do you expect from a Gambling City?  I leaned my lesson the hard way.  All the Camping Workd misfits and rejects must get sent here to this location.  I told them I wanted a 20 year loan and both Mike and Paul agreed, but when I signed all the paperwork a bombshell was dropped at the end that it was a 10 year loan and at the end it would automatically be started over with another 10 years, so I signed and agreed.  But something bothered me a couple weeks later so I called I called the bank and found out that I had been lied to.  It was a 10 year loan and a balloon payment at the end, or you could re-apply for a loan and see if you still get approved.  Now I smell a gimmick and probably out to get more money and a higher interest rate.  So I immediately refinanced with someone I trust for the whole 20 year period.  Then, I had warranty work that I mostly pointed out before I took possession and that became a nightmare. They have several mikes and you constantly get transferred to the wrong one even though your specific which one you want.  It seems to be something that is done on purpose by the gals that answering the phones.  It gives the opertunity for the correct one to say ""I didn't get your voice message"".  These sin city gamblers are game players and play stupid.  They can never fix anything right the first time as if the mechanics are misfits just like the sales and finance manager.  This location should shut down completely and send all the business without the employees to the Henderson, Nevada location to handle.  And another sad thing about the Las Vegas location is when you buy a new trailer and want to buy things for it, their stock of items is horrible.  They don't even stock a complete set of anything in any color.  Like I said: Missfits.  I would like to say ithe hot weather is the problem, but I can't because Henderson Nevada is just as hot there and they are Great-Fantastic!  And then there is Jesse the Genderal Manager here at the Las Vegas location, who is just there without a clue of what he is suppose to do.  He just sits in his office pretending to be working and avoids handling any things.  Jesse is like the used salesman that never learned how to sell, but has the smile and Knod down, and makes promises that the problem your having is unacceptable and tells you that he will get to the bottom of it, and yet does nothing.  His title should be the Babble Manager.

The best advise that I can give you, is never get out of your vehicle and go in.  Drive-Drive away and go to a different location or another company that cares, because this Las Vegas lotion is horrible, the worst in sales, needed supplies stock, maintenance, management, and most important - customer satisfaction.  Please don't follow my mistakes."
2,5,"Update 2: We brought our class A in to get a tow package for the Smart Car. Everything went smoothly until the Roadmaster celanoid failed. Twice. Luckily the techs discovered it before we left the parking lot. John-John, Oscar and Denny refused to give up. Finally a good celanoid was delivered and everything works great. These guys went above and beyond for us. They spent hours showing us how to connect and disconnect the system. They went on a drive with us to show us how it works. These are awesome people! No complaints at all with the service department! Kudos to Mike for having a great team. 

Update: Since purchasing our new motor coach, we experienced several factory deficiencies in some areas. We were told by other owners, it doesn't matter if you spend $80g or $500 g, there will be kinks to work out. We had the toilet or some part of it break, three times, the dinette conversion bed was not properly constructed making sleeping on it dangerous and the whole entry door was crooked. All of these issues have been handled each time efficiently and professionally by the Camping World service department. While they don't like seeing us so often, we have come to know several employees by name and have a good relationship with them. The service manager Mike is awesome and makes every effort to get things done in a timely fashion. John Miller, PDI, knows so much as he used to work at the Thor factory and John, one of the technicians is extremely knowledgeable. We don't enjoy having to keep taking the thing back but it's so nice to be greeted warmly by our salesman, TJ and the other staff. My husband believes people in the service industry should be tipped whenever allowed and these folks are no different. A few bucks and a sincere thank you go a long way. We are looking forward to many road trips and adventures in our rv."
2,1,"This is the worst service department I have ever encountered.  I have been dealing with them for a year because I bought my motor home from them.  They have had it on the lot more than I have had it on the road filling me with every excuse in the book.  Mike is a nice kid but over his head.  DO NOT trust them to do anything they say within their time frame.  C all them every day.  My issues were warranty related and they didn't even send the requests in until I complained to the service manager several months after I left it.  Terrible, terrible, terrible.  My sales experience was great but I will never deal with them again because of the service."

2,2,"Bought my first 5th wheel here. Was very clear about my inexperience. Also clear that I would be living in it full time and that I had no truck to move it and would need it delivered and set up. Steve the sales person was very condescending because I was a female. ""Oh well, you're so independent...chuckle chuckle"" uhm, I can guarantee no man was ever told that. I let him know I'd eventually be buying a truck that could pull it but simply hadn't yet. Again ""well, I don't doubt it...chuckle chuckle...you're so independent."" Wtf?!? I'm a 48yr old woman. Ya. I dress myself too. 
So they give me some song and dance about my inability to get financing and tell me I'll have to get a worse type of financing with a higher interest rate and a bigger down payment. He's telling me this while I am having a check cut at my credit union for the full amount and a very low interest rate. Again, my vagina does not detract from my brain. I bring the check in and they are slightly stunned. ""Oh you got your own financing all by yourself?"" Seriously. Fed myself that day too. He looks at me while holding the check for the full amount and says ""Did you want to sign papers today?"" Maybe this is his first time selling an rv I think. Yes I'd like to sign the papers. I just paid you. Then he runs my credit card for the down payment I had said I'd give had I used their financing which I did not. It took almost a week for it to get back into my account. It goes on like this. Finally a week later I go in to do a walk through. They had been fixing some things. So 2 hrs later they are ready to show it to me, my salesman was not there as it was his day off, though he had told me they always come in for delivery, so Oscar shows me around the rig. Oscar is the best part of this whole scenario. So helpful. So informative. Funny, kind, nice and oh he doesn't care that I'm a female. I'm just a person who doesn't know a thing about RVs and he's trying to help me. Oscar is awesome! So we finally head to my site and after 45mins the mental midget driving the truck, who is completely ignoring Oscar's directions, gets the thing parked somewhat straight. He gets out of the truck and says ""I didn't want to scare you but that was my first time."" No shit Sherlock. They didn't level it, they only hooked up the hoses when I asked them to and they didn't even turn the water faucet on. I later found out I had been using water that was sitting in that tank for god knows how long. Ew. They didn't turn the water heater or water pump on. They did nothing that was discussed. So now I've been calling but they don't return my calls and my 5th wheel is still not level which as I read about things more and more and speak with my neighbors is not very good for the rig at all. I would never buy anything from Camping World again, unless I had a penis maybe but probably not then either."
2,1,They sold my Info to some scammers and I all most got ripped off! Be carful dealing with them!
2,5,"I bought my 5th wheel here about a year ago, and had a positive buying experience with Sten. I was even able to include a 4 year extended warranty on the used unit. 
A year later, this is my first experience needing service work done. And I am beyond impressed with the staff and service department! 

~ Prompt with communication and returning my calls.
~ They were flexible with their full schedule, seeing as I have an upcoming trip and limited time to get necessary work done. 
~ They worked with my extended warranty company to get just about everything needed taken care of for my deductible. (Which considering insurance warranty work is not always as simple or quick a process)
~ Quoted me a very fair price for new tires. 

In summary, my entire experience with this Camping World had exceeded my expectations! I am beyond impressed! It's very rare to find a big company like this that still upholds the small business ethics, ""Valuing the Customer"". 
I will recommend this place to anyone looking for a RV, knowing that they will stand behind their products beyond the sale."
2,1,"I hope this helps anyone out there who are looking for a store to buy your necessities. First off go to the Henderson location. They have a pretty large store and pretty much have mostly everything you need. 
I went to the Las Vegas Camping World and it was so small. I went there because I had a $20.00 coupon I needed to use, so I went in to buy RV step covers. They had them, but they were higher than the internet price. There were 2 sales people there, one girl who had short black hair and had tattoos up and down her arms, and a guy who looked like he just did not care to be there. She told me that she could give me the internet price, but she would have to charge me the shipping also. I looked at her in disbelief. She said it is better to pay the price they had posted, it would be cheaper. So I bought them and a tire gauge. I used my $20.00 coupon and got in my car. Something made me call the Henderson Las Vegas Camping World and talked to a service tech who just happened to answer the phone, he looked up the price online and said that the store will print out the sale page on the internet and give the price the internet has, no problem. I tried to return my RV Step covers and the tattooed girl said she could only give me back the money for the RV Step covers and would not give me the $20.00 coupon. She said to go to the Henderson Store and they would credit me because I was in the system and when they pull up my Good Sam membership the transaction will appear. So I guess I will be going back tomorrow.
I can not believe that Camping World would condone this kind of service, including all the other bad reviews. Anyone who goes to this store who could be a potential Good Sam member would just walk out and never go into a Camping World again. They also have a very small assortment of needed items for the RVer, being off Las Vegas Blvd you would think that they would be a big store with good customer service. 
If you are traveling and need to buy supplies for your RV or Camper go to Henderson. If you are going to buy an RV, Go to Johnnie Walker RV on Boulder, they have the best service guys there and everytime I go there with my RV (and I go a lot plus I am a woman who asks a lot of questions) I always get good customer service from their service department and sometimes pick up odds and ends for my RV there too. 
Please read the other reviews, if your looking for service or sales and if you do decide to go you just might be taken from sales, service or the store. Your Choice!!"
2,1,"This place is a F@$KING joke!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS! We're currently out in the middle of the California desert trying to fix their F-up ourselves, will update this review later."
2,1,"Horrible service. Took my trailer in for a wheel bearing repack, estimate 400 
Dollars. Also wanted tires. Service writer Brad wouldn't give me a quote on tires as ""prices change all the time""  Got a call from Brad, the estimate was now 1750.00 as the bearings were dry, the brake linings were flaking and the hubs wear required replacement.  The 1750 quote did not include tires.

Asked to see the parts that required replacement while the trailer was still in the bay.  Brake linings were fine, bearings were not dry, and the hubs were serviceable.  Brad suggested that the brakes had been too tight.  I told him that they were the last ones to service it, but got no response.  

When I picked up the trailer, one of the dust covers on the hubs was missing, which I discovered when I got home.  They claimed it must not have been there when they worked on it.  Neither Brad nor the mechanic said it was missing, and Brad agreed that it should have been noted if it wasn't on the wheel when I turned the trailer over to them.  Basically, he told me that since they didn't have one in stock, it was my problem."
2,1,"I didn't think our experience with Camping World Service (CWS) could get any worse after purchasing the rig from CW in Boise. Why Boise? The rig was $16,000 cheaper than the ""best"" offer in Vegas. We had 3 minor repairs that were covered under warranty after bringing the rig (2016 Montana High Country) home. We had to wait 3 weeks to get an appointment. It took another 2 weeks to get a phone call saying they finally saw the coach and would let us know what was needed. Why the hell did I have a freakin apppointment for it to sit there for 2 weeks!!! Then  a few days later a phone call that the parts had been ordered and we could pick the rig up. Excuse Me!!!!! It's 1 1/ 2 hour round trip from our northwest Las Vegas home to CW. We left the rig there. After another 3 weeks I got to pick it up. Here's where I really get irritated. The lot man brought the rig, dropped it and left. I'm there by myself trying to line up the coach to our 5th wheel, and the coach has no battery power to lift it. I walked the 50 yards back to the ""service"" department to get help. Whether it was my husband or just myself hooking up, someone should be there to ensure that we're good to go.  I truly wish that Johnnie Walker RV carried the brand we bought. We love their service department and have always felt like a valued customer. Moral of this story- Camping World Service, whether it be located in Boise or Las Vegas should be avoided if at all possible."
2,1,"I dropped it here for service & 3 warranty items. It took 3 months and a very long list of excuses and no call backs. Absolutely the most disorganized service ever! They even called me 2 months into it and told me the parts came in and bring in the trailer...it was already there, stored in the back out in the hot desert sun!! They forgot it was even there! When I left it there the tanks were all dumped, when I got it back the black tank was 3/4 full!! Use your own bathrooms! I was told it was stored  under the canopy, it wasnt as you can see in the pics. Just more on their list of uselessness. I am sorry I bought it here. They have ruined the Rv experience. I removed all tags from it relating to CW, I don't want to be connected in any way to this horrible place."
2,1,"So, in april of 2017 i left a 5 star review for this place. I should have not left that review. After we left and began our travels it became apparent that they didnt fix the warranty work they said they did. We even tipped the jerks. We had to bring the rv back to them and they had it for 2 weeks while we stayed in a hotel. They promised they would plug our rv in but they didnt and ruined $300 in frozen food during those 2 weeks. When we went to get our rv they hadn't finished it with an excuse that their body/paint tech had a broken arm. We brought it back later and they FINALLY fixed the warranty paint work. For our troubles mike (punk) promised us 2 rv washes and wax and carpet shampoo. We took it in april 9, 2018 and were told it would be done the following day. When we went to pick it up, the wash was horrible. Im sure it only took 20 to 30 minutes to do. The carpets were not shampooed as promised. The only thing that looked nice was the tires. Everything else is bad. We are taking it in to get it properly washed. Oh, kevin with camping world is a punk too. Come on people, camping world has 77 reviews and 2 stars. What a piece of crap this service is. Go elsewhere!!!"
2,1,"BIG ZERO for the repair department!! We have an Alpine just a couple years old and the roof peeled back a year ago. They replaced the entire roof charging more than they quoted and taking longer than they quoted. The caulking looked like crap... embarrassing to pull it around but we let it go because we figured if thats what it takes to keep the roof on... guess we put up with it. WELL... 10 months later the roof peeled again. Repair department integrity DOES NOT EXIST. They quote you repair time and price and something always ""happens"". Try the boulder camping world or someplace else....save yourselves from the stress and disappointment!"
2,5,"We purchased our Coach from Camping World sight unseen, a scary prospect. However Hector couldn't have treated us better. He informed us about everything. The coach was used and we were told it had front end damage that the body shop was going to take care of. He sent us pictures so we would know exactly what happened. The repair was going to take 6 weeks. We were also told the coach was in like new condition.  Hector was transferred during our waiting period and we were turned over to Sten. Both these men went out of their way to answer all our questions. You make a call to them and they answer, send a text and one would come back immediately. Nice to be treated like you are so important. Finally the day came for the coach to be transported to Portland. Mike in Vegas called to let us know there was a little scuff mark on a seat and we could have it repaired and they would be happy to pay for it. When we did the walk thru we noticed a couple of other issues. No problem taken care of no questions asked. The coach is beautiful, the body work on the front is flawless. What a refreshingly positive experience. If I ever buy another RV I am heading to Vegas. Thanks so much."
2,5,Camping World Las Vegas really helped us out in a pinch.  We were travelling down from Canada and had an issue.  Doug from service took us in right away andwas able to fix our problem in 1/2 hour.  Thank you Camping World. ..we appreciate your friendliness and attentiveness.
2,5,"Everyone here is great, from the sales staff to the management. They are all friendly and knowledgeable, and willing to help in any way possible.

My wife and I had never owned an RV, so we were complete novices. Our salesman, Wes, was very patient with us, and not pushy at all. After he showed us around the different types of RVs for over an hour, we told him we were going to check out some other dealers. He thanked us for coming, and said he hoped to see us again.

When we returned a few days later, the fifth wheel we wanted to purchase was listed at a higher price than it had been on our first visit. Wes assured us we could get the lower price. When the paperwork came through with the lower price, I requested they knock even more off, and this was done with a smile, too. No haggling or being told that we were going to bankrupt the company like car salesmen tell you.

Signing the paperwork was easy, too. We were offered an extended warranty, but it wasn't shoved down our throats. When we said, ""No thanks"", that was it. 

We were given a quick orientation of how the trailer works, and were allowed to leave the trailer on their lot until we got our hitch installed on our truck.

Again, at every step of the way, we were treated like valued customers, even though they know we probably won't be making another major purchase from them for several years. I wish all companies were this professional in the way they deal with the public."
2,1,We stopped to get help with a safety problem using our trailer towing system. We also thought we would get propane while we were getting help. After waiting for 20 minutes no one offered to try again to find us help. Too busy to dispense propane. Too busy to help a traveler with a safety issue. A very disappointing experience at camping world.
2,2,"Bought my first 5th wheel here. Was very clear about my inexperience. Also clear that I would be living in it full time and that I had no truck to move it and would need it delivered and set up. Steve the sales person was very condescending because I was a female. ""Oh well, you're so independent...chuckle chuckle"" uhm, I can guarantee no man was ever told that. I let him know if eventually be vying a truck that could pull it but simply hadn't yet. Again ""well, I don't doubt it...chuckle chuckle...you're so independent."" Wtf?!? I'm a 48yr old woman. Ya. I dress myself too. 
So they give me some song and dance about my inability to get financing and tell me I'll have to get a worse type of financing with a higher interest rate and a bigger down payment. He's telling me this while I am having a check cut at my credit union for the full amount and a very low interest rate. Again, my vagina does not detract from my brain. I bring the check in and they are slightly stunned. ""Oh you got your own financing all by yourself?"" Seriously. Fed myself that day too. He looks at me while holding the check for the full amount and says ""Did you want to sign papers today?"" Maybe this is his first time selling an rv I think. Yes I'd like to sign the papers. I just paid you. The he runs my credit card for the down payment I had said I'd give had I used their financing which I did not it almost a week for it to get back into my account. It goes on like this. Finally a week later I go in to do a walk through. They had been fixing some things. So 2 hrs later they are ready to show it to me, my salesman was not there as it was his day off, though he had told me they always come in for delivery, so Oscar shows me around the rig. Oscar is the best part of this whole scenario. So helpful. So informative. Funny, kind, nice and oh he doesn't care that I'm a female. I'm just a person who doesn't know a thing about RVs and he's trying to help me. Oscar is awesome! So we finally head to my site and after 45mins the mental midget driving the truck, who is completely ignoring Oscar's directions, gets the thing parked somewhat straight. He gets out of the truck and says ""I didn't want to scare you but that was my first time."" No shit Sherlock. They didn't level it, they only hooked up the hoses when I asked them to and they didn't even turn the water faucet on. I later found out I had been using water that was sitting in that tank for god knows how long. Ew. They didn't turn the water heater or water pump on. They did nothing that was discussed. So now I've been calling but they don't return my calls and my 5th wheel is still not level which as I read about things more and more and speak with my neighbors is not very good for the rig at all. I would never buy anything from Camping World again. Unless I had a penis maybe but probably not then either.  

UPDATE: So I went in to Camping World the other day met with Steve told him the situation. He said why didn't you call me? He apparently, hadn't gotten any of the messages. He immediately got on the phone making arrangements to have the leveling issue fixed.  Turns out someone who works there lives where I do and was able to come over and get me situated properly. Jim was awesome. Came over with a cocktail. Showed me around the trailer and came back a couple days later with his truck to get it leveled. Very nice! It's all good now. They certainly got on the problem as soon as the right person knew I had one."
2,1,"If I could I would give a ZERO. Here is the email I sent to Corp Offices.Hello Marcus,I was told to email you about my experience during my purchase of a nearly $30,000.00 travel trailer through Camping World. I attended the RV show at The Orleans Casino in Las Vegas about a month ago and both my family and my mother and father bought the same trailer that day. So the sales person who sold it to us received his commission on the sale of two, not one in a matter of maybe 30 minutes max. When purchasing the trailer, we were never shown any of the cool features of the trailer or explained what kind of hitch or any other added merchandise we would need to prepare for our first camping experience in our trailer. My mother and father put down a rather large down payment where my husband and I could only afford $300.00. We both signed the paperwork that said they were deducting the $300.00 and my mother and father deposit that day. 
I specifically remember checking my account and noticing a $300.00 deduction pending. I assumed it was the $300.00 from Camping World especially after I was told by my mother that her down payment came out the same day.
Fast forward to the actual signing of the paperwork for the trailer several weeks later when my trailer came in. The very first thing that Steve Takahashi wanted me to sign was the authorization to take out the $300.00 deposit. Now, I work as an accountant for a very prestigious company called Exotics Racing. I deal with a high volume of accounts and hundreds of thousands of dollars daily. My job is to make sure numbers are right and that my company does not over pay or under pay any vendor. With this being said, I told Steve that I had already signed weeks ago for the down payment and was certain I saw a charge go through of $300.00 so to do my due diligence, I wanted to check my account to ensure I was not being double charged. At this same time, I asked my husband to call my parents and ask if their down payment was taken out the day we saw the trailer or the day they signed the papers and they concurred their down payment was taken out weeks ago which only added to my concern that I was being double charged. After looking over my account, I was assured that there was no charge taken out and I explained to Steve that maybe it was a hold that dropped off. He explained to me that no, this never happened. By this time I had already signed the paper agreeing to take the $300.00 out when Paul Gottlieb enters. He had a piece of paper in his hand and was listening to my conversation shaking his head in a no fashion. He than threw the paper in front of me and in a very sarcastic voice told me that there is no way anything was done to my account prior to this day and he had the paperwork to prove it. (Little did he know that I had already came up with that conclusion, I was merely trying to figure out what I had saw in activity with my account and with the confusion of my mother being billed and me not being billed even though we were there the same day was why I was still talking about it to Steve) I looked at Paul and explained to him that perhaps there was a pending charge that dropped off and that I deal with numbers all day as I am an accountant and I just wanted to make sure I was charged correctly. He than looked at me and said "" Than you must not be very good at your job"". This is when the situation became explosive. I had never been so rudely insulted by anyone in my life. I asked Steve if I could talk to his boss and Paul says "" I am his boss"" so I proceeded to say, than I would like to talk to your boss and I am done talking with you and you can leave."" He came back with a smirk on his face and said that his boss was not available.At this point I wanted to walk away. I looked to Steve Takahashi for some help. He was reluctant in saying or doing anything to smooth this out. He knew that Paul crossed the line with that comment but I could also see he was annoyed with the situation and maybe at some point he felt that it was deserved even though my problem was not with him. Steve told me he was getting another supervisor to come in and speak with us. We waited about ten minutes and than Steve Nohrden came in. At least we got someone in to help us who was totally understanding and was embarrassed that this employee insulted me the way he did. I told him the story as I just told you and he explained to me that it would not drop here and encouraged me to email you about this experience. He also informed me that this was not the first time that Paul did this to other customers and that he was surprised my husband did not deck Paul in the face for being so rude to me. Later, after signing paperwork, Steve Takahashi gave us two complimentary nights to some local camp ground to where I live. It was a nice gesture I suppose but clearly not enough. I would like a follow up with Paul and lastly because of all the lack of information given to us at the trade show when pu"
2,5,"Mike Hulsey in service is always so helpful!!  He takes the time to answer questions that we've had as new full-timers and first time RV owners.   We've had a few small things and Mike always takes the time to help us get it taken care of as quickly as possible.
Would highly recommend him!"
2,2,"Good place if you need to purchase a small item for your RV. On the service and repair side they are one of the worst. When I drop my RV off for warranty work, expect them to keep it 3 to 6 weeks and only get about 1/2 the work done even though they said they had completed the work. For example, the door latch broke so the door would not close. Dropped it off and 6 weeks later still not done because they said wrong part was shipped. Ordered the part on Amazon, got it in 2 days, and had it fixed within an hour. If you can go anywhere else for repair work do so!"
2,1,"Worst place ever. The sales department does not even know what customer service is. The service department is horrible.  After buying a new 5th wheel here. The roof delaminated on the second trip. We made an appointment to bring it in. My husband talked to them 4 times before we brought it in. Then we took it in and they said we did not have an appointment . We have talked to keystone direct on the issue and tried to give them the contact who is aware of the roof defect. Nope camping world could care less who we talked to.  The only reason we used them now is they are the authorized keystone dealer. Stay away from this place if you can. Aug 31,2016"
2,1,Another bad experience at camping world below standard customer service as God is my witness don't think of purchasing anything you will be very sorry
2,1,"Please read!!! Do NOT trust this place with absolutely anything! I had them do a 45 point inspection on a sportsmobile that I was interested in buying. After paying $300 for an inspection, I found out that they did not actually inspect 95% of the things they were supposed to! They checked things off as ok that were blatantly not working! The furnace control didn't even have batteries in it yet they said it was working properly. The fridge was broken and also checked off as ok. When I called them out on this, they would not admit fault and just lied more and more. This is the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced and I will do everything in my power to make them pay for what they did to me. I am considering suing them for stealing my money, even if it costs me a lot of money in the process. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do NOT use this camping world for absolutely any service, you will be scammed. For the record, I reported this to a manager and nothing was done about it."
2,5,We love our new RV.  Everyone was wonderful and helpful!  The promptly help with any concerns with your vehicle and we were very happy!
2,1,"What a bunch of crooks!!! Took our RV in for services use to make sure everything was running right , was there for WEEKS!!!!! Finally my husband goes to pick it up , gets right on The freeway , doesn't even get more than a mile away and IT DIES!!!!!! Had to call a dang tow truck! Does that make sense to you? Not me ! The battery was completely drained! Worked fine when we dropped it off!!! AND the oil was BONE DRY! Don't you check that in a routine service!?! We called and of course they didn't accept any of the blame .Shame on us , this is the second time this happened , last time we picked it up from service with a full tank , got it back completely empty . They denied that also, they're good at that. 
Save yourself the trouble from going to this place, any other rv service place will be better !!!"
2,5,Bought our second Tt at Camping World over the weekend and we were blown away at how courteous and friendly the staff were. Our salesman TJ was awesome and made us feel comfortable right from the get go. We traded in our very first Tt for a brand new model and we could not be happier. Will definitely go back to this location.
2,1,"HORRIBLE Service!  Took 2.5 weeks just to get an appt.  They kept it for 2 weeks, and we finally had to call them to see where the repairs were at.  They charged INSANE amounts for diagnosis of problems.  For EACH small part that needed a 5 minute repair, they charged a full hour of labour, and were totally inflexible!!  We had 4 small things that needed repair.  Their part prices are totally unreasonable.  AND they even forgot to repair the main problem we came in for!  The service guy was a meek personality-less policy-quoting parrot. I will never take our RV to any camping world again! They have no care for customer retention nor customer satisfaction."
2,1,"Had an appointment to get warranty work done on our RV and it was scheduled 3 weeks out. Arrived and was told to leave the RV as it would be an additional 3 weeks before they could even look at it.

Spoke with another couple that said they have had their RV in there for over a month and nothing was done so they were picking it up to take somewhere else.

This place is so packed with RVs to repair I was lucky that I could turn around and escape. I plan on avoiding this place forever."
2,1,"Absolutely the worst customer service. Went to buy a trailer. Budgeted $30000 on a new one, but service so crappy, decided to purchase used from private party instead."
2,5,"OK, let's put this issue to bed once and for all....  The Las Vegas Camping World is ONLY an Express Store for parts and accessories!  This store is primarily for RV sales and service.  With that clarified, if your are looking for ANYTHING for camping or  your RV's, go to the Boulder Hwy store and pack a lunch.  The store on Boulder Hwy is huge and stocks anything you could possibly need for your camping and RV needs.  We've found that if they don't carry it, they will get it for you or you don't need it!

I also want to address our RV buying experience at the Las Vegas store.  Perfection!!!  From the sales and service staff to the finance staff and even the 4 legged staff, we were treated like royalty.  We spent many days researching which RV we were going to invest in and we got great advice from the staff.  I appreciate a sales person that will risk a sale and speak the truth.  Once we described our intentions to live full time in our coach, our sales person told us that the coach we were considering would not meet our needs and steered us to a better alternative. After we made our decision and subsequent purchase, the entire staff at Las Vegas Camping World have bent over backwards to assist us in getting our new RV lifestyle off the ground.  We have found the ENTIRE staff to be friendly, helpful and patient.  If you are finding your experience to be so drastically different from ours, maybe we should all remember to be a little friendly and patient???  Just sayin""...."
2,1,Horrible camping world! Alot of employees and not one offered to help see if we needed help finding something or just to say hello welcome they all just sat there!!!! Place was dead silent what an awkward store. Would not recommend at all!!!....over staffed for an empty store. It is empty because the attitude the employees have! I have camping friends in Vegas and I will be telling them not to support that camping world at all!!!!
2,1,"We bought are brand new trailer. We got a great pric2 other than that its been a bad experience.  First off the finance guy told us are credit score was lower than it actually was,  next we came back the next day and the finance guy said you were right your score is higher. He then add gap insurance and extended warranty with out are knowledge.  Then they said don't worry we do a white glove inspection.  Well I wKed up to the trailer and then there is 2 major dents. So then they tell us it will be 6 to 8 weeks to get the part. That's horrible.  Then they called 2 weeks ago and said they got the part it will be ready in a week.  My husband called about the trAilor and said sorry we put your trailer on the back burner. We bought the trIlwr a month ago.  It should have been a priority.  We were planning to take it for my birthday in two weeks.  Don't buy a trailer from here customer service is horrible"
2,5,"We purchased a nice camper from Mike Walsh and Todd  Stancliff. This was our first big camper. The area was clean and organized. They answered all our questions. When we had a problem with our water heater, the maintenance dept got on it right away.  
 Regarding maintenance/repair, i do feel they need to hire more mechanics and have that dept open on sundays as well. I feel totally confident with the maintenance dept.
 All the info for registration was given to me by Taylor Stancliff, who did a superb job. I did not have to wait for a callback with the info. 
 (By the way, the phone is answered by real humans).
 Would I buy another camper from Camping World ? Absolutely !!!"
2,2,"Went looking at a travel on a Sunday, we found something we liked as a family and worked out a deal. We negotiated, credit was pulled on myself and my wife. With a pop up camper for a trade in we where offered a deal of 210-230 a month with zero out of pocket. We all agreed and shook hands and my wife and I went home, emptied out our pop up camper and brought it in for our trade in.      We where told financing would call us on Monday or Tuesday to finalize paperwork and schedule orientation and delivery of our 2018 Mallard. It's now Wednesday morning and no paperwork. I called them at 8:30 and got a voicemail, waited an hour and no response. We have a trip booked since February at Zion National park but we have no trailer. So I just drove over there to see what the hold up was. I spoke to a finance manager (I'm leaving all names out, I believe people are good, but sometimes fall in a rut they themselves don't want to be in). He shook my hand and lead me into his office, he had just heard from ""the banks"" and our ""deal"" had changed drastically. 
    Now the banks wanted the $3k from my trade in plus another $5k out of pocket plus our term went from 15yrs to 10yrs. So now our monthly payment was $380 a month. I don't know what happened, who is the finance guy on Sunday who offered us the first deal??? 
     I'm a very patient person, I asked for my title to my pop up camper back, also the keys, now to their credit, they didn't hold me hostage, I told them the original deal is the ONLY deal, if that's off the table then I need to leave with my pop up and get ready for my camping trip. They quickly gave me my title, keys, and sent me on my way.  My wife and kids and I really liked that trailer, but a $5,000 discrepancy is unacceptable. 
      I did read all the bad reviews on yelp, but really wanted to give them the benefit of proving past Yelpers wrong, oh well, maybe in the future, I'd give them another chance.  (The pic was taken on Sunday, oh well)

2,1,"Horrible!  Terrible experience and all we needed was a ladder.  If you do not need to go here don't go!  The customer service is nonexistent.  Bad, bad, bad!

This place is awful.  We have been rving for 5.5 years and have gone to Camping Worlds across the US and, although I wouldn't give any of them a great rating for service, this one was terrible.  We were second in line behind a problem issue with one customer and watched as 3 employees just walked on by... then the ladder we came to purchase was partially wrapped but we were assured it was new and fine.  We got it to the rv and it was broken.  We had to take it back and they didn't have another one so we had to go to the other Camping World 20 miles away.  We traveled over 60 miles to replace a ladder :( and the employees are just rude."
2,1,"Not the most ethical sales people (Steve T) Will ruin your buying RV experience.  When you go in there to make a deal with them - the first words that came out of his mouth was ""Be prepared to take a BIG loss."" Seriously!? who starts off a negotiation like that.  He tried telling me the trade in value for  my 2016 travel trailer would ""depend"" on what I was buying.    That was the first flag.   Your trade in value should be your trade in value weather you buy something new or old.  Thats a classic sleezy salesman tactic of working it into their profits.     He told me originally the trailer I wanted was in the ""High30s.""   When I told him I had a trade in, He changed the price to 49k for the trailer.     When I told him that was way too high of a price and I know what that trailer should go for - he lowered it to 35k within seconds!    So Ridicules.   The guy was totally arrogant and made my skin crawl.  Terrible experience."
2,2,"Went there for the first time to buy some parts I needed for my Motorhome and was very disappointed by the selection they had. I am used to their store in Orange County CA, which is well stocked. Not worth the drive from The airport area. Ended up ordering the stuff I needed online from Amazon. Better prices."
2,1,"Stopped in to look at RVs with the intention to leave with one we saw on the website. Stood in the lobby for 10 minutes, with no other customers there, and at minimum 10 sales people joking amongst themselves 15 feet from us. Not one of them inquired if we had been helped or if they could help us. We left. 
Lost sale for Camping World, successful sale for someone else. I guess they didn't need our $90,000."
2,1,"Fist off let me say this is my first Yelp review. I am so upset with the customer service I received that I had to rate them and if I could give them NO stars I would! The service department is rude, unhelpful and they have no idea what they are doing. First off I called and spoke to Ed, I have a Bison LQ horse trailer that is still under warranty. He said they did not take their warranty but would call and get charges approved and take a credit card. Bison said that was fine. I called again because I had another small fix and spoke to Rob. Rob said he was out Monday to bring it in Tuesday for both services. I had my mother take time out of her day to take it down for me since I work (which is clear across town). When she showed up Ed tells her he can't see her and she needs an appointment and he couldn't get it in until another week. One of the issues was my antenna broke and was hanging by wires from the top of the trail. Ed proceed to tell my 50+ year old mother to get up there and duck tape it. WTH??? So my mom makes an appointment to bring it back. My mother takes it back to the appointment she scheduled. Ed does not call Bison to get the charges approved or the credit card number from them. Instead has my mother pay $541 when she picks it up. I am so upset with the service I have received from them! I will NEVER take my trailer back to them nor will I buy a single thing from them again!

In looking at my bill, they said nothing was wrong with the antenna but still charged me $129 for it. It is clearly glued on an Ed saw it hanging by the wires just the week before."
2,1,"I purchased a brand new trailer form here in December. While purchasing the trailer everyone was my best friend and was offering to help with what ever I needed. I took it out dry camping for the first time in January and the ignition on the refrigerator was bad so the fridge wouldn't run on gas.  Upon bringing it in for the warranty repair I met Brad. By his demeanor if it was as if I was inconveniencing him by bringing in the trailer. Brad has zero customer service skills. I came in later to try to figure out why I didn't have a part that was supposed to come with trailer when I picked it up. He called the keystone rep and the rep confirmed that the trailer should have come with the part. Brad then sent me to someone else who ""would take care of it"" only for that person to tell me they couldn't do anything and to talk to Brad. What a JOKE of customer service at this dealer. You're real important until that check clears and then they couldn't care less!!!!"
2,1,"TERRIBLE customer service!  Actually non-existent ! Why hire people when my dog could give better customer service!  When you ask about a certain part and which of the two you will need for your RV then the so called employee there will just point and say "" it's back there "" .  I asked another so called employee for help when looking for an item and was responded with "" I'm doing something right now, can't help "".  We actually contacted Camco about an anode which Camping World could of done IF they had any customer service! We were told at camping world that the ""Suburban"" anode was the only one that would fit our water heater.  REALLY?  Guess what? The anode by Camco ALSO will fit and it's $9 less!  What a rip off and NOT RECOMMENDED! Good Sam Club will be hearing about all these complaints on this location too."
2,1,"this has got to be the worst experience I have ever had in a purchase a major purchase at that if there's anything that I can say or do to convince you that this is not where you want to shop from the sales people that lie to you to the lack of customer service that you receive after you've purchased it to the poor workmanship they referred me to Las Vegas Freightliner to do some repairs on a motorhome that could have caused my motorhome to catch fire it took me three weeks to convince them that they should have to pay to have it fixed the day I drove off with the motorhome I had a check engine light took it back the same day they told me it was only a gas cap I asked him to replace the gas cap and they said no that isn't what they do I had to go buy one myself they offered to take the bulb out so I wouldn't have to see the check engine 
 light later I find out that what was wrong with the could have caused my motorhome to catch fire and they wanted to take the check engine light bulb out it took another week for them to approve payment to Freightliner after it was repaired Freightliner indicated to me that they do not like doing business with Camping World don't buy from Camping World they should not be in business  Freightliner however did a absolute fabulous fantastic job"
2,1,"We bought a used class c that needed a few things fixed some were under good Sam warranty. The ladder had broke , the step pin broke,and the awning but according to camping world nothing was covered or maybe it was just our service writer Kevin who from the start was very condescending about us even buying the RV and that we were even stating off . Also needed a gasket for the toilet camping world was charging 340$ you could buy a new toilet 300$ which includes installation. we ended up taking the RV out of there and will have the Work done by someone else. Most of the reviews here are correct I wish I would have paid attention"
2,5,"I see lots of negative reviews about the service department but my husband and I had a great experience here when we purchased our rv. We were treated like royalty compared to the other places we visited to see different types of motor homes. TJ Gallina was our salesman. All of our questions and concerns were addressed timely and completely. It was a super hot day when we went but TJ turned the ac on in the unit we liked and let it cool down while we sat in the dealership until it was comfortable to spend some time in it. We are so happy with the purchase, the kind staff and the adventures that await us. With Camping World dealers everywhere we know we have a lot of people we can reach out to if we need help in our travels. 
There will always be people who will complain about things, please don't let them deter you from coming here and meeting these folks. I am disabled and my husband is a disabled veteran. They have accommodated every one of our needs. We feel confident hitting the road knowing TJ and the service team are a phone call away. Happy Trails!"
2,1,"Place is overpriced big time, they don't even match their own prices. Shurflo water pump on Amazon $56 in their store $165! Simple bathroom 14"" inch ceiling fan $190 and SAME thing on Amazon for $39 and you want me to buy my next RV from you? Yea I don't think so! I honestly don't think I've ever seen another  customer inside that store. Save yourself a trip and don't bother going there"
2,1,"These guys are a bunch of clowns. Brought our 5th wheel here and wanted to get the awning fixed. 2 weeks later we still hadn't received a call to tell us how much it was going to be to fix it. I finally called them and they told me they were just getting to it. Long story short I went down and took my 5th wheel someplace else, because when you are standing there in front of them and they take over 1.5 hours of your time to do a write up they really don't give a crap about you."
2,1,"I wouldn't buy anything from Camping World if I were you.

I encourage you to get internet quotes from several places for the RV you want.  DO NOT TALK TO AN IGNORANT SALESMAN... and DO NOT go in person until you have struck a deal.

Generally speaking, all salesman are liars who have little to no product knowledge.  So go check out the RVs WITHOUT a salesman present, take pictures, and try EVERYTHING OUT.

Look at other people's reviews, and use the various internet quotes to get the price DOWN on the RV you want."
2,1,"I am surprised that I have not read any comments about the paintball course next door. If you had your RV there and you have a waxy substance on it, it is because your RV was used for target practice. I left my RV on the 14th for an appointment on the 19th. It went into the shop on the 29th. I had made this appointment 1 month in advance This was not for an actual repair, it was to initiate a warranty claim and to take pictures etc. I went to get something out of the RV and the left side had about 15 paintball hits. They were very unconcerned about my RV being potentially damaged, saying oh yeah it happens all the time. Said they would clean it all up. When I went to get it , the wash job was pathetic. Myself and an employee spent 2 hours cleaning it on their lot before I could leave. I am still finding the waxy stuff splattered here and there. They had to get on the roof, and apparently someone either exceeded the weight capacity or were not being careful using the ladder, because it is now bent. I was told they fixed something concerning the slide, but they did not. When I told Ed I did not want to bring my RV back to them for target practice, he became angry and wanted me to pay 2-way freight on a piece of rubber 3 inches wide and 6 ft long that he had ordered. I don't think Ed likes his job or people. He was rude, not only to me, but to the customer ahead of me and behind me in line to drop off. I would avoid this dealer."
2,5,Ask for Eric Marley! Super friendly service and very knowledgeable. He took care of us on upgrading our 21' travel trailer to our new 2018 Fifth Wheel and couldnt be happier. Oscar did our walk through with us he was very patient and Joe our finance manager made everything go smoothly. Thanks All!
2,5,"Five stars for selection and location- NOT for service. Camping World carries about the best selection of high end Class A motor coaches I've seen in the southwest. Go for the selection, then purchase it elsewhere."
2,5,Thank you Joe and Mike in the service department.  What a dream to have such technically sharp guys and great service.  We considered driving 8 hours just to have our Motorhome serviced there in stead of our local ones. Luckily with their advice we didn't need to keep it there.  But next time we will be back!  The Henderson Camping World has a larger store with more inventory.
2,1,"Drove into this somewhat overwhelming place that does everything for your camper.  I have been to another one before and had such a great experience decided to cover all the things needed here.  Went in to ask about getting the things done that we needed done and was told go there and there and there.  Sounds fair.  The first there was in a different place than pointed too.  Then I was told the gas was outside and we will ""get there when we can"".  I get busy, I have seen busy in many places.  But rude is not necessary.  We asked how to go to the service section.  Do we need to register somewhere?  Do we pull up and someone will come out?  Do we sign in the building over there?  ""just drive over there.  Not my department"".  So we left.  Good thing nothing needs to be done today.  It can wait until we get back to the Camping world in Santa Clarita CA where we get treated well."
2,5,"My wife and I recently bought a preowned 22'Premier Ultralight travel trailer. Our salesman Robert Dustin was great. He greeted us asking if we had questions. He took his time and there was no pressure whatsoever. We closed the deal. Jeremy in finance was a pleasure to deal with as well. Can't forget Kay at the front desk. Very nice lady. 
What follows is why I gave a 5 star rating. We had dropped off our vehicle to have the hitch and wiring installed. When we arrived Nothing was done and I was upset. Lori (very pleasant lady) asked she could do to assist and I explained the issue. She looked into this and said someone would come to explain what transpired. The service manger Mike stated that our vehicle was not rated to tow the trailer. This was very disturbing as Robert and I both confirmed that it was. The service team started to dig into this further. After about 20 minutes they discovered that had incorrect information. Well now it was too late for anything to get completed for install. Understood we are several miles from the dealership so it was frustrating. 
On the way home being disappointed I received a call from the sales manager called and he stated he was aware of the issue and asked if he could talk this over with his GM Jesse Jensen and get back to us. 
The next morning Mike called me taking ownership and apologized. I thanked him and we worked through the inconvenience. 
I stopped by the next morning to do the walk through and was greeted by Robert. He apologized as well and expressed what Camping World was doing to make this right. The walk through with Jesse from service was great (a real nice guy). I also have to mention Josh. Although he was not our salesman,he took the time to assist with the audio system in our trailer. 
I then met with the GM Jesse and he was apologetic and asked if everything was satisfactory. I said it was and that he and Camping World should be proud of the staff that they had working for them. 
If we ever decide to purchase another RV, Camping World will be our first stop.

2,1,"One word: CROOKS!
Their only one purpose: SALES....that's it! No customer service, no follow ups, no interest whatsoever about their clients after the sale is finalized. LIES, LIES,LIES.........and MORE LIES
DO NOT DEAL WITH LARRY GARCIA or JOE BARDOT. They're better than you........and you're sh#t to them.

Another advice: check and research the internet for value of anything you buy with them. You will find anything better on RVtrader."
2,5,"See Hector . He saves vacations . We were in a bind called in , got in , got out couple days later and still went on vacation . Thank you Hector and Kevin ."
2,1,"It's unfortunate that I am unable to give zero stars. Against my better judgement, we took our trailer to them to fix some damage on an insurance claim. The service department at Camping World is completely incompetent, and sexist towards women. They have had my trailer since September, have been paid by my insurance claim and continue to drag their feet and treat me like I don't know what I'm talking about. Granted, this is after I had to take two hours out of my work day to go down there and pull something out of my trailer the mechanic was too lazy to look for. Additionally, I receive a call from them telling me they can not find the parts for my trailer, yet it took me 30 seconds to pull up the parts online and email the links to them for the parts. Mind you, they start working on ordering parts two months after I drop my trailer off to them? I also had a part I would have had to pay for and they marked up that part 53%, that's indicative of price gouging. The service manager ""Mike Holsee"" is unprofessional and sexist. The General Manager ""Jessie Jensen"" refuses to return my messages.  I will NEVER return to ANY Camping World after this experience. This is the worst experience I have had anywhere. My next call will be to their corporate offices."
2,5,I brought my new trailer in camping world las vegas for some warranty work . The tech john miller came to help me with trying to find out why my trailer wasn't working correctly . John was very courteous and helpful . His knowledge of camping world products is very extensive . He helped in getting my trailer in to be repaired. Camping world has a very good employee in John Miller
2,1,"Let me first start off by saying, we will NEVER again come to this location and most likely won't ever return to a Camping World after our experience today. 
My husband and I went in along with our two children. We've been here before and experienced good customer service from a gentleman who's name I cannot recall, but today was totally different. We've been fifth wheel shopping for a few months and had it narrowed down to two different manufactures. One of which Camping World carries and had the particular model we wanted to look at before going to another store. 

We were greeted and couldn't remember who we talked with a couple months back so we had another man help us and I do know his name and if management wishes to reach out to me, I would be happy to give it, but I won't leave it here. He started out by telling us my husband's F250 would tow ""anything on the lot"". After he said this, we knew he didn't know what he was talking about. 

We looked around for a while and decided to go in and sit down and discuss the model we were interested in. Normally, any time you're in the least bit interested in anything, whether it be a car or RV, you go in and talk about it. I'm not sure what gave him the impression we were ready to give him our money today, but he certainly was under that impression. He was kind enough to give our kiddos some crayons and a coloring book to play with when he thought we were going to just hand over the check, but then.......

My husband told him we had a little thinking to do, he stood up and all but grabbed the crayons out of my 2 year old's hands, gathered up the papers and walked out the door without a word. He came back, tossed a card across the table to my husband and that was that. 

Because of this HORRID customer service, we won't ever be back. We decided against the model that Camping World carries after we left and even if we decided we wanted it, we'd rather drive 250+ miles away than go back here. 

What a joke."
2,1,"We have had our RV since March. It has been in the shop at Camping World Las Vegas or Camping World Bakersfield all but 2 days since we bought it from Las Vegas Camping world. We have made several payment on our $80,000 RV  Gen manager Jesse Jensen and Service Manager Mike  told us to come back to Las Vegas when it was finally fixed and the would have a settlement that would make us happy if we did not take them to court.  We got to Las Vegas. The basically laughed at us. We are not offering you anything. Admitted they lied to us to get us there to take it home.  When we said we were not taking it under those conditions. It was a piece of hunt.  Jesse Jensen told us they would dump it out side the gate in the gravel.  Jesse is LDS and knew we were   He used that he was a return missionary his wife was YW pres to give the impression he was an honest person.  When I said today I should call your bishop. He actually laughed at me and told me go ahead he was in the bishopric and would haha tell him all about it in his meeting.  I was so discussed with him and his integrity.  Don't go to camping world Liars 
We will be takin the to court"
2,1,"I got an auto response. I emailed them. Still no trailer, still no response. My husband called them today and no one called him back. They don't care"
2,1,"Wish I could give zero stars!!! The service is HORRIBLE! My husband and I are planning to purchase a Travel Trailer but have no idea where to begin....length? How many people does it sleep? What are the different features? The guy that was showing us the various trailers was super rude. He rushed through the information as if WE were keeping him from something else! I believe he thought we weren't real customers....
By the time we got to the 3rd trailer to look at it I was done and ready to leave! I think his name was Troy but whatever the case, he was a total a**hole! I refuse to come back! Kick rocks!"
2,5,I'm back with another 5 star review.  We have decided that our RV needs an updated satellite system to make it just perfect for us.  I called Chuck and within one day he had us scheduled for 1 week out and made sure to assist us with the multiple purchases necessary to complete this install.
2,5,"Just bought my new 2018 Hurricane 35' Class A RV from Mr. Josh Gray (No Relation). Outstanding service. A professional who want to make the entire purchase a very positive and knowledgeable experience. He even cam in on the delivery date and stayed late to transfer the old RV belongings to the new one. Then answered my call later to answer a question about the operation. Extremely upbeat. Willing to work hard to make the purchase happen. Well done. Highly recommend asking for Josh Gray when shopping. Also, his product knowledge was detailed and accurate on each RV we looked at. He was a RV tech prior to sales and it shows."
2,1,"Waste of money & time. Been waiting for30 mins to speak to manager.  The haven't fix any of things they were supposed too. They broke stuff like the stove. 7 month old trailer leaks in the rain, can't cook, due to them breaking stove. Awning has hole which they patched, can see fingerprints in patch.  
The places it sucks. DONT USE IT THIS BUSINESS FOR ANYTHING."
2,1,"Has ownership changed here in the last year?  Used to be a great place to spend an hour browsing in a low-pressure environment.  After checking in and stating that we didn't want anything from a salesman other than a point in the right direction, we were handed off to a salesman who just had to get us registered for their ""drawing"".  Understand the wanting to gather information for leads, but really wanted to avoid this run-around today--and said so many times.  Explained it to the salesmen, but he ignored and kept asking for our info.  We stood and politely said we would be leaving.  I offered my handshake for goodwill and he wouldn't shake.  Classy.  We are writing this review as we are driving to a competitor for hopefully better service.  This interaction spoiled an almost 100% sale on a 30+foot trailer."
2,5,I am the other half of Ford's comment. We are making payments on  unit we cannot use.  They say come & get then bring it back to get the work finished. Really. Really camping world is this the kind of service you would want for yourself or your family. Get your shit together and get my RV done.  I will gladly hire a lawyer to resolve this because I am very tired of listening to the BS from your service people.
2,4,"We have to say, this inter-action could have started better but Mike over the service department took ownership of the repairs after we brought his attention to some missed details.   I think communication is a must, respectfully voice your discontent, IF  there is any so management is made aware.  We are glad we did and will be a returning customer.   Most smaller places really do NOT want to do warranty work. Camping World doesn't mind, SO there is a heavy work load.   I am not saying they are perfect but Mike showed us he does care and will make it right, if need be."
2,5,"We've had several warranty repairs done here and Mike Hulsey was so easy and great to work with.   I can't imagine the stress his job carries!!  He has so many people that want their units fixed immediately, and like others, our RV is our home which adds to the pressure to do it perfectly.

Warranty work is never quick or easy.   Pictures have to be taken with paperwork to fill out to send to the factory.  They have to approve the work before Camping World can even touch the repair that needs to happen.   So getting upset about length of repair time is silly unless there is an extreme amount of time taken.   Really anything less than 2 months is reasonable.  That was a hard fact to learn with our first RV.  But it always got fixed and Mike is friendly and knowledgeable.  He kept us in the loop on repair status.

We recently had a towbar and baseplate installed and we are excited to hit the road and test it out.   Thanks Mike!"
2,2,"The Sales guy we had "" Chris K."" Is the only person working at this place who knows what he is doing. 
He has gone above and beyond, because no one else responds to phone voicemails or anything.

We bought a huge toyhauler that needed a new side patio door. We have been waiting a month for the ordered door to arrive down there. It took nearly a month for the Title Dept to get our DMV Paperwork to us! We had to call and bug them at least 5 times. How much you wanna make a bet, in the interim of WAITING... the prep work and other details they said they would fixed hasn't been done yet!!!! Nope... it wasn't. The door arrived down there 2/9/18 and here it is 2/15/18 a whole week later and they just opened the box the door came in. How do we know? Earlier this week we were arguing with Chris about what is taking so long, he said the door was white and needed to be painted and cured first. Yesterday 2/15/18, he called and said the door came already painted. So that tells us they just opened the box. They still want to keep it till Tuesday 2/20/18 because putting the door on is a 10 hr job. I don't think so!!! We called the GM Brian and he said they will get on it tomorrow... we'll see!
They had the trailer ready for pick up. Patrick really was thorough on how to's for everything. 
They said that our decals for our door will be shipped to us ( because we didn't want to wait)... well It's been 3 weeks so far and NO DECALS. 
This saga goes on... and I will update and make changes if I'm wrong. 
Until then... I highly recommend you don't bring your camper here or buy one here!!!!"
4.5,5,Johnny came out to our motor Coach and did an excellent job in changing the oil and checking all the fluids and lube.  A very knowledgeable and helpful person.  I will call them every time to service our Coach.  Thank you Johnny.
4.5,5,We use American Motor Lube on our RV trips to Vegas. I forgot to get the guys name ...  but this was not the first time he took care of us. He shows up promptly and does a great job!  Because of him...  we will continue to use American Motor Lube.
4.5,5,"Mike and his Team are the Best , Dependable, Professional, and Extremely clean ! I would Highly recommend them to all ! They service the RV. I am a Retired Building Inspector and Contractor. If you want Quality at a Fair price with no hassles call them."
4.5,1,"I have tried twice now to use American Mobile Lube, and on both occasions despite being promised a call back to schedule an appointment to come out nobody from this company has bothered to call me back. I guess they are more interested in serving their existing commercial accounts than taking on new business. At least Sandy, the receptionist who takes my calls is nice even though the manager I get transferred to doesn't seem to know how to use a phone to return calls."
4.5,5,Just used these guys for my oil change. They called before and showed up at my home on time. The service only took about 20 minutes. The mechanic was very professional and helpful. The price isn't bad either. I would definitely recommend them to anyone. I will be using them for all of my oil changes.
4.5,5,"I have used American Mobile Lube on two (2) occasions in the last six months to service my RV, which is parked in a storage facility. For the first service, they did an oil, filter, and lube.  On the second occasion, they did an engine coolant system flush and service.  

I was very pleased with both services.  Their technicians were polite and appeared knowledgeable.  I plan on using them to service my RV in the future."
4.5,5,"Amazing company 
Makes getting your rv oil changed painless 
Best part is you dont have a dirty t shirt anymore because these guys take care of it all.
Will absolutely refer to anyone who asks"
3.5,4,"Keeping the small engines of Waunakee running smoothly

Warning: If you're looking for a review on where to a new or used farm tractor, prepare to be disappointed.  You'll need to find another intrepid Yelper review to fulfill that need.  While Carl F Statz and Sons sells farm equipment as well as recreational vehicles, this review is limited in scope to their small engine parts and repair department.

With that disclaimer out of the way, these guys do a bang up job keeping my yard equipment running smoothly.  This locally owned outfit gets things done when they say they will and charge a fair price for their services.  I became a fan for life when the guys in the shop fixed a flat wheel barrow tire for me at no charge one Saturday afternoon.  (Bonus hint: attempting to move a 300 rock with rickety wheel barrow = bad idea)   While it was a relatively simple fix for them, it saved me a couple hours of frustration and allowed me to finish a significant yard project that day."
3.5,1,"I really wanted to like this business because I live so close...2 years ago, I took a used snowblower in for service in which they repaired the pull chain for about $100...then, a couple of months ago I tried to ready myself for today's impending dig out...when I tried to get a belt replaced and the pull chain reppaired...again, they informed me I would be better served with a used snowblower they had for sale...I bit and dropped $150. 

It ran for a total of 45 minutes...when I called and spoke to an owner, he told me it was probably due to a dirty carburetor...this is after I was guaranteed the model was tested and ready for winter. No true solution was offered by the owner. 2 poor solutions in a row does not make me trust a 3rd.

I will NOT be back."
3.5,5,"My father needed a part for his tractor. So, I called around a few places and stopped after talking to one of their tech people at Carl & Sons. They were so incredibly helpful. He talked to my dad and he received the part right away. My father doesn't live in Madison or the surrounding area, so for him to get the item so quickly was fantastic. 
If we have a need in the future they will certainly be my 1st call."
5,5,Great on time service. Would recommend for any of your RV needs. They sell propane at a reasonable price. Employees very courteous and friendly. Full service supply store. Keep up the great work.
5,5,Had a couple mufflers replace at Performance Muffler on my 1962 Chevy ll. Russ the owner is a knowledgeable and very good at what he does. The quality of the work is excellent I highly recommend using Performance Muffler. Thanks Russ keep up the hard work.
2.5,5,"I have been to this location many times.  My first time there I was looking for someone to look over a camper and my truck to see if everything was okay to drive and that the two fit well together.  Steve Smith was awesome.  He has helped me with lighting the refrigerator, stove, heater, etc.  He sold me two awesome generators.  Told me what my tires need to be set at when towing. He is very knowledgeable when it comes to parts, fixing anything on a camper.  I go back to this location because of Steve. Steve is also someone that will take the time to explain things to you and help you with the best way to fix things without gouging your pocket book.  Thank you Steve."
2.5,5,"We were traveling in route to our destination and we needed to have some assistance with our pressurized water valves. They were leaking and letting all the water out of the freshwater tank. That's not a good thing !

I called little dealer little prices and they were very courteous. When I arrived they had both valves available and they provided exceptional service answering all of my questions. Steve in the service department was helpful in directing me to the right people, Andrea was very instrumental in meeting all of my service needs and then some, Damion was a great conversant and friendly cashier, and , Andrea was very instrumental in meeting all of my needs and then some. Brian is a rock star and installed the valv effortlessly and I didn't have to wait a year to get it done . Oh yeah, his assistant William was helpful too.   

They even personally showed us the way to leave their facility as we have a tow on the RV. Couldn't ask for better service and they had all of the parts we need it. A definite recommend! Thank you!!!"
2.5,1,"Stopped in this weekend to look at toy haulers.  Girl at the desk was helpful and friendly, but the salesman, KC was a total jerk.  So arrogant and dismissive, not sure why, maybe it was because we weren't dressed like people with money.  He really just didn't want to help us.  Asked about a trade-in and told our trade was basically a piece of &#(@*& and didn't even want to talk about any kind of deal.  He basically tried to get rid of us ASAP.  We were actually interested in two different trailers, but I will NEVER go back there, even if we never find another dealer that has those models!"
2.5,1,"My husband, a disabled Viet Nam veteran, and I who are retired in our late sixties were not treated fairly at Little Dealers Little Prices.  We truly believe we were intentionally mislead and deceived not only by sales persons, the parts department but worst of all the manager.  We were in the market to obtain a motorhome when we saw them at an RV Show at Westworld.  The motorhome model we liked was parked at the show with many people walking in and out, opening and closing refrigerator and freezer.  This particular motorhome had a dent and scratch in the truck body, the convertible table/bed was opened and closed who knows how many times was leaned on and used as a support for leaning sales people. We noticed some definite disrepair but salesman disregarded by fiddling with it and said it worked fine.  Sales also assured us at this event that there was a $500 rebate or discount for this motorhome or any others at the dealership. There were signs posted to that effect and a half sheet of paper advertising this fact.  
When we got to the dealership the manager told us that he could not give us the $500 discount because we were already getting a small discount for the dent and scratch.  We had a major intense discussion with him but we ended up conceding. After paying full price as if this motorhome had never been used (minus the small discount for dent) we drove away in our 2017 Gulfstream.  On our first trip to Flagstaff our refrigerator and freezer flew open over and over again scattering food and it really never was an effective way to keep our food cold.  We used a cooler with ice for most things. Come to find out the fridge was defective in the closing mechanism because of continual use by these shows they brought it to.  The table continually dropped down due to same reasoning. This motorhome was not ""new"" it was ""used"". We had trouble with many other things too numerous to post here.  Little Dealers Little Prices CHEATS VETERANS!!  SHAMEFUL and Very Sad!!"
2.5,4,"We brought our horse trailer here to be repaired. We thought it would be an easy fix but it turned into a much bigger issue than anticipated. Both our service rep and the technician were fabulous. We had to take the trailer home and bring it back so that they had time to finish the work, which was fine. They were very thorough in searching for the problem, fixing it and making sure we understood the issues. They also checked and repacked our bearings, which needed to be done. We enjoyed their awesome showroom while we waited and will definitely go back here for our horse trailer and RV needs. T"
4,5,"I called in with a refrigerator problem, needing advice on what the issue might be. To my surprise, Jeff didn't try to sell me anything (no parts, service or maintenance plans) but gave me the advice necessary to resolve my problem.

Thanks Jeff!!"
1.5,1,"Terrible customer service, I took my Motorhome in for an engine oil change and a generator oil change and to replace an air conditioner. Took 4 weeks to replace the AC Unit. When I picked it up they forgot to do both oil changes. I took it back for a slide out issue. After 4 weeks still no parts and still no repair. I'm told it will be 2 more weeks . So I will be without a Motorhome for at least 10 weeks over the summer for minor repairs. No one ever answers the phone in the service department and it takes  several days to get a call back when you leave a message ."
1.5,1,"This company single handedly spoiled RV camping for me and my wife. I would not buy a stick of gum from them.  In the two years I owned my camper every service visit was a huge hassle.  Lost paperwork, price quotes change, work not completed- three service repairs required 11 visits to get the job completed.  Don't even bother calling them - they never return calls.  The service manager told me that they don't even know how to access voicemail.  I had to drive over to get a status of the work - weeks after it was promised.  Turnover is through the roof and you will hate yourself for making the mistake of buying anything from them.  Even warranty work they tried to bully me into paying for - totally unethical organization.  I am amazed that they are still in business.  Feel free to email me - I can give more details how my wife was totally dismissed by salesman and when I went in to complain was told by other female staff that is expected.  Or how I was told that the warranty covers less as it approaches the end of warranty period."
1.5,1,"Avoid Tom Johnson Camping World at all cost!!!!  Poor quality products and the service after the sale is literally a train wreck.  In the 241 days I have owned my new camper, it has spent 79 days sitting on the service lot at Tom Johnson.  I purchased my Shamrock travel trailer in May and noticed a bad external speaker at first use.  A replacement speaker took 8 wks and 4 phone calls to get part ordered and get my unit in for service.  On my next camping trip, a window latch broke causing the side window to flap in the wind as I was driving down the road.  The first major rain storm produced a leak in the ceiling of the camper as well.  I have made four trips to the dealer and assured the window and leak had been fixed only to find within 10 miles down the road the latch broke again and was flapping in the wind.  And after next major rain storm - behold the leak has reappeared.  Most recently I escalated to the service manager and brought the trailer to the shop for him to take pictures and order yet another replacement window - 10/30/2015 (I refused to have the camper sit there and not be able to use it any longer as my summer had already been shot).  After waiting 4 weeks I called and was advised the window had just arrived and the first appt available was 12/14.  I dropped off the trailer the night before I have made three calls since 12/14 and my trailer was not even looked at until 12/29 - it takes a month to get an appt drop-off time and an average of 14 days after the appt to have someone even look at the unit?!  This morning, 12/30 I was told the 3rd replacement window was never ordered and that I would have to wait another 4-6 weeks.  They have fired two of my service consultants in the last 30 days and I have resorted to keeping a spreadsheet so I can re-explain my story to every new person each time I go in.  AVOID THIS DEALER.  I have no idea how they stay in business."
1.5,1,"Customer service is awful. From starting with getting through on the phone to making an appointment. We had our travel trailer there for a simple repair no update and took over a month to get It back, then when we got it back they didn't even fix the problem. Avoid them at all cost! 
Oh and not to mention the store is so small inside!"
1.5,1,"I really wish I could give an update with more stars than my original, but the service here is horrible. After my first review, they contacted us but still took another 2 weeks before we finally got our camper back ( after a month total) , water heater works but we were charged for other things we had them look at, like a broken air conditioner vent. We were told it was past 30 days so wasn't covered. And it was when they looked at it, but we had text messages that show we reported it 8 days after we brought it home. The cable TV hook up has lousy reception, we were told that's 'as good as it gets' and its the campgrounds fault. Even though the picture is perfectly clear if we hook it through a window to the cable box. The air conditioner is crap, but we will live with it until we can buy a more powerful one ( but won't be bought from these people, ever!)"
4,5,"I've been researching smaller camping trailers for more than a year.  I looked at all of the Little Guy models, NestEgg Trailers, Happier Camper, Aliners and more...

Jason, Allen, Andy and the guys in the shop at Tom's Camperland were fantastic.  They answered all of my questions and I never felt pressured to make a purchase.  I wanted a light weight trailer that my wife and I could use as we transitioned from tent camping to a trailer.  After much research I decided to get the 2017 Columbia Northwest Aliner Scout Lite.  I wanted a simple setup and the ability to use the camping gear that I found most useful after 40 years of tent camping.  To give you an idea of how serious we are about our camping, we took our two children on a five week tent camping trip to celebrate our 25th anniversary.  While the kids were growing up we camped in many of the western National Parks and we spent time at Rocky Mountain National Park almost every summer.

After we decided on the Aliner Scout Lite, Allen quoted me a very fair price that I found was about $2500 less than the local dealers in Northern Colorado.  We negotiated a few items and I made the purchase over the phone and drove to the Mesa, AZ Tom's Camperland location to pick up the Aliner.

Working with the guys at Tom's was a great decision and we look forward to many nights enjoying the Aliner."
4,1,"I bought a 5 wide teardrop rough rider  from Toms Camperland in Mesa AZ and was very specific when I ordered it to let the salesperson know how I intended to use it. I don't work and planned to live in it for a number of years just driving around. I prefer to be alone so I got the off road trailer. I am disabled and very limited to what I am able to do. I also got an ac/heater unit, generator, and solar panel. Within a month a door lock broke and the company sent me another one. I went to Alabama and while there the generator quit. I took it to a dealer and they replaced the spark plug and adjusted the carburator. Then a curtain string broke and I had to get another curtain. While that one was enroute the other one broke. I could see that was going to be an issue so I didn't order another one. I did send them an email letting them know that the other one broke but I didn't intend on replacing. Shortly after that I started noticing a rubbing noise behind the electrical panel. It was loud but not consistent. I told Jason about it and was told to give it time because it was new. A month later it was louder so I contacted him again. I ended up bringing it back to them to look at and it wasn't making the noise so they couldn't tell what was going on. While in California it was horrible. I videoed it and was told that it was the converter and I would have to go to the nearest dealer to get it replaced. That was in Redding CA and I was by Yosemite national park. Like 7 hours away. 
I had been using the solar panel and noticed the plug in was extremely tight. It broke off. I let Jason know and he said he would send a replacement to Redding. 
I decided I wasn't going to use the camper power and run the heater off the generator. Then after a few weeks the general started acting up so I altered my trip and went to Redding. The rv place replaced the converter and I took the generator to a Honda dealer. Jason hadnt sent the solar panel replacement plug to Redding so I had to hard wire it to the battery and contacted the company that manufactured the solar panel and they sent me one to my address in Arkansas. The new one fits fine. 
The generator dealer said there was some wires that had broken loose and were confident that they had it replaired. I have always wanted to see Yosemite so I drove back down there. They hadn't fixed the generator at all. I called them and they said it was too small for the 5000btu unit. I contacted the company that sold the ac unit and they sent documentation that it wasn't too small and told me it was because I was in a high elevation. I drove 2 hours to Modesto, which was at around 200' above sea level and it still didn't work. I took it to another Honda dealer and their mechanic said there wasn't anything wrong with the generator and that it was just too small for the ac unit. 
I ended up cancelling Yosemite and drove to Carson city nv to yet another dealer. He fired up the generator and within seconds knew what was wrong. He replaced a servo motor. It ran fine but I stopped running it on the cargo platform and the mechanic said I needed it to be on its pads. There weren't any. I notified the Camperland salesman again and told him there weren't any pads and I had to buy them myself. He didn't offer to reimburse me for them. After that the generator ran fine, even at 11,000'. 
I drove up the pacific coast and used my ac unit and generator without fail. Then I got to central Washington and tried to use the ac and it never blew cool air. An e4 code came on the temp readout so I bypassed Jason altogether and contacted climateright. They said it was ruined and sent another one to my daughters house in Arkansas. I hadn't driven it off road between the time I used it in Oregon and then tried to use it in Washington. 
I went to higher ground again and cut my trip short again to go swap out ac units in Arkansas. The new unit only lasted a month. I

**** I deleted some of my review because Brad responded and his response was completely off base. I followed up with the Better Business Bureau and the response they gave there didn't match this response. But it did still blame me for things. As I stated earlier, I was VERY specific how I planned to use the trailer. I did have to email them a lot but it was more like 40 and the un-timeliness of Jason Amalog response caused a bulk of the problem but the outright deception about the capabilities of the ac/heater unit is un-fixable. Not to mention that there were so many times Jason Amalog did not respond at all. I had to talk to someone else to get the appointment rolling to fix the converter. 
***DO NOT BUY FROM TOMS CAMPERLAND. THEY WILL NOT PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE***
****
Do not buy from Toms Camperland. You will do all the leg work to use the warranty and they accept no accountability"
4,5,"I drove 6.5 hours to Tom's from Albuquerque after having had a super easy exchange with Brad on the phone. As soon as I arrived at Tom's I discovered that my ABQ UHaul folks had put the wrong wiring on with my hitch. Alas, in barely 15 minutes, my wiring was fixed with an adaptor and new hardware and what could have been a nightmare and a delay was quickly and graciously solved by their staff. No charge. Before I left, I got a thorough rundown of my t@g camper by Zach, and was really happy with the service, kindness, and expertise I encountered by all of their employees.  I highly recommend this business wherever you are coming from. Wish I could say the same for UHaul, although it was my fault for not double checking their wiring job."
4,1,"For being a new place or at least at a new location you would think they would be eager to welcome their customers. My wife and I have been walking around for 20 minutes and not a single soul has greeted us much less offered assistance.

My response to the owners reply is simple. 


I was not there to buy donuts, we were looking at product that ranges from 30 - 100 thousand dollars, you would think it would be obvious we would need some help assessing our purchase. The showroom was nearly empty and the staff actually walked away to the back offices if we approached. Maybe I just don't have the right complexion for your business?"
4,5,"The service department here is great. Troy took care of numerous issues in our 2018 flying cloud and got it back to us in three days. 
Since we use the Airstream full time, this was critical and much apprecited. 
Service manager Joe has a great team and all the repairs tested out great.
Even though we bought in Chicago, we will be returning Las Vegas Airstream for all our future business."
2.5,2,"The RV Park is pretty much a parking lot behind the Circus Circus hotel. Each site has full hook ups. Barren, not pretty, but conveniently located right next to the Strip. No Wi-Fi was offered to us. Mostly families and older folks. No party RVs. The registration office closes at 7:30 pm. To check in after that time you have to walk all the way to the hotel lobby, which is quite a walk. The pool was filthy. The water park seems fun but you have to pay the resort fee of $32 to use. They shut off the water without warning for an hour in the middle of the day. Bathroom was old but clean. 

We were in several RV camps this Spring break and this was the worst, thus the 2 stars. That said, it was exactly what I expected based on the other reviews. For one night, it was just right."
2.5,1,"Yuck! That's about sums up what I thought when I pulled in to stay for the night. You would be better off staying in a Walmart parking lot. 

We were passing through and thought this might be ok for us and the 3 kids to stay. When I pulled in, it's was confusing where to find the front entrance. Finally drove to the front office. It looked like an out building. The entire campground is black asphalt with no way to delineate which spot is where. 

It did not look like a safe place to stay so after the wife was told it would be $60 - $75 a night we pulled out of there and headed down the road. The Oasis was a much better choice."
4,4,Made a reservation online and received exactly what I booked.  The RV was very clean and well kept.  Customer service was excellent.  Pick up and drop off went very smooth.  My only complaint would be that they charge $10 a day if you plan on towing something behind the RV.  I felt that was a little ridiculous.  I prepaid for the dump which was only $25 because if you don't dump it they charge you $75.  I will definitely rent from here again.
4,4,"We just came back from a six day rental of a 31 foot RV from El Monte. I called their 800 for general information and the woman that answered was very knowledgeable. She highlighted the best options for us and I made reservations on the first call. Prior to arriving in Vegas I called the local office to make sure we were all set. They were very professional. 

When we arrived we had to wait 90 minutes for a shuttle ride (why I gave them four stars). Once they picked us up it was smooth sailing. Tim pushed us through the paperwork, the training video and the actual walk through of our RV. We received a 2011 RV with 20k miles. It was in very good shape and all the equipment worked perfectly throughout our trip. 

When we returned the equipment it took about 20 minutes for the whole process and we incurred no additional fees.

Couple of points on the RV itself - the ""queen"" bed is not really a queen size and the mattress is a very cheap spring mattress (El Monte just delivers what the manufacturer offers - but they should upgrade that mattress). The rest of the beds are foam mattresses and are much more comfortable. El Monte offered unlimited generator time for free - this is very important if you are out in the desert West - when you are not plugged in you can still keep the whole trailer cool. Many rental places charge for the number of hours the generator runs.

We plan on renting again from El Monte."
4,5,"I rented from El Monte on S. Las Vegas Blvd. and had a wonderful experience. The staff were very thorough in explaining how to work everything. RV was clean,  perfect working order, smooth transaction from beginning to end. No complaints from me, I highly recommend. Will use them again."
4,5,"Rented rv's from them for many years.  Always a pleasure to see Sandra and the El Monte staff every year in Vegas.  See you again soon.  Stay hydrated down there!  

Thanks again,

2,1,"These people are crooks.  They delivered the 5th wheel on the wrong property without the ac and keys.  
They had to come an take it all the way to Las Vegas from California to install the ac.   Putting about 10 hours of road wear and tear on it. 
Now I can't open the bathroom door bc the a/c is in the way.  
It's been a month.  My first payment is due tomorrow.  No one will answer my calls.  I've called and emailed mike hulsey who is supposed to help me within 30 days.  Still no call back.   No email back. He said he would help me but He obviously is avoiding me.  I still have no access to my RV.   I'm basically homeless because of camping world.
I've put in several complaints to corporate. Contacted the BBB.  Not sure if there's anything else I can do.  I'm currently seeking legal assistance.    
Please don't let these crooks steal from you.  There's 10 million other RV places you can go who will be honest.


Update : 7/24/2018.    These guys don't even respond to the Better Business Bureau.    Attached is a letter from the BBB regarding this matter. They hit my fence while delivering the 5th wheel.  Mike Hulsi promised he'd get it sorted out.   Changed his mind on that. Said he's done enough. He won't call me back about it.  Now I have to go through the legal process.  

They sent the guy who does the paint to remove the door.   Now there's no bathroom door.  My mom has to use the bathroom with no door. We're about 2 months in.  This 5th wheel still isn't fit for someone to stay in.   

Mike Hulsi- I hope you wouldn't put your mom through this.  This is terrible.  It's been a nightmare. Please steer clear of this establishment.  The will be out of business soon.  


Attached is proof from the BBB

My next step is to contact the attorney general aside from the legal process."
2,1,It would be appreciated if the service center would answer their phone so I can schedule maintenance for my new Motorhome. I have been calling for three (3) days!!!
2,1,"Was shopping for a RV and due to the numerous terrible reviews, this was the last dealer in the Las Vegas area I went to.  

I get it, there are a lot of RV's but salesman did not even know how to extend the slides or apply external power.  Tried to force on an electrical connector that didnt even fit the unit.

Bought a new 2019 Thor Freedom Elite.  Walk around was a joke.  Was told how to turn on the AC, pointed to 6 remote controls and the tech said, ""there is your remotes,"" with no explanation on how to use them or any other systems.  He appeared to be in a hurry and just wanted his paperwork signed.  Spent a lot of money on the unit and expected more of an effort.

  Receptionist is rude on the phone and in person.  Appears put out when asked a question.

Warranty service is a joke.  Given an appointment for 9:30 A.M., show up and you might as well be invisible.  Took over 45 minutes to have a service person even to start to check us in.  No effort to speak to us or advise us of delay. Minor things to fix:  Dash Map light and Ceiling fan exhaust both inoperative among a couple other minor issues.

Had to make an appointment to pick up on Saturday, as you have to have an appointment to pick up for some reason.  Showed up and the employee said the driver will bring it around and explain the repairs.  Driver dropped off the coach, then disappeared.  No explanation what so ever.  Guess what, the dash map light and ceiling vent fan still don't work.  Asked for a technician and was informed none were available, and to call back on Monday.  Drove the unit over 60 miles round trip for this????

Will never spend another dime at Camping World as they have lived up to their terrible reviews.  Any required service will be accomplished elsewhere.  Anyone looking for an RV in Las Vegas, avoid Camping World!!  I wish I could have given them zero stars!!!!"
2,1,"Before you visit this store or even try to check out their store please read this. I will be as concise and direct as possible.

THE SALESMAN AT THIS CAMPING WORLD ARE NOTHING SHORT OF THIEVE AND GANSTERS.

Expert nothing but that!

https://youtu.be/6wrsMU7WMuQ"
2,1,"They have very terrible service. We purchased a new motorhome from another Camping World location but had the lock mechanism for the only passenger door break while we were at the Hoover Dam. The door could not be unlocked. We got a ladder and crawled back in thru the emergency window to drive the coach to the nearest Camping World.  We pulled right next to their service department and called them to ask for their assistance  in helping us get out of our new 200k motorhome. They told us they were busy and that they couldn't help us escape from the motorhome until two weeks in the future.  We pleaded for them to reconsider but their service group refused to help us even though we were literally right next to their service door.  We bought the coach from Camping World liking the idea that they had repair facilities throughout the USA.  What a HUGE disappointment. The management at this store is not enhancing the ""Camping World"" brand."
2,1,"After having a EU 7000is Honda generator stolen from me in August 2017, I decided to purchase another new EU 7000is from this Camping World. I told Mr. Flores, the Parts MGR I wanted him to bring my generator to my trailer that was parked outside their fence about 400 yards from their store. The man operating their forklift did not even secure my new generator to the pallet. I had to put my own strap on to try and secure the generator. Their forklift operator ran over the strap I had put on. And it subsequently yanked the generator to the ground thus damaging the unit. I told forklift operator to look what he just did. I had him call Mr.Flores, his boss. Flores came out and looked and saw the sustained damage. He stated he would just order me a new door which was all scarred/scratched up. And he told forklift employee to just drop the generator and make me push it another 200 yards to my trailer. I sent scathing email to Mr. Lenois, Camping World CEO complaining about Mr. Flores and his forklift operator. The very next morning I received a phone call from Regional MGR Mr. Robinson that he would be bringing a brand new EU 7000is from their Henderson, NV store to replace the damaged one. Upon Mr. Robinson, delivering my new generator Mr. Flores, was there and he was pissed that I received a new generator. About a month later the same generator went on sale for $ 3,800.00. A hundred & Fifty less than what I paid. I asked if they would credit me that said no emphatically. Even their Regional Mgr Mr. Robinson, said absolutely no also. Two months later they called the cops on me to leave their property outside their fence. I wasn't bothering anybody at all. The cops banged on my door at 4:00am. I asked the officer who called on me they ""Camping World.""
I would never buy anything from this location ever again. Everyone I previously mentioned are total asswipes. These are some of the most heartless individuals in this world bar none."
3.5,4,Great repair department.  If I don't use Meikles True Value then I go here.  Not 5 stars because I SO want to keep my $ local but any small engine parts are always more than Amazon. Why?  You guys need to advertise that you will match or beat Amazon. Otherwise I have to wait in a line after work at Statz whereas Amazon has the cheaper part in my mailbox when I get home.  Please resolve this.
3,1,"Very disappointed in the integrity of a reservation. We made a reservation for a pull through two weeks in advance. We even called 4 hours before arrival to assure a pull through due to the size of our rig. However when we arrived at 6pm we were told our pull through had been given to someone else and we were put in a back in that was too short. The reservation manager was not apologetic and told us that a reservation for a pull through only assured us a ""spot"". She said we were welcome to find someplace else if we weren't happy. Too bad because this is a nice resort with Pickleball courts but if we can't depend on the integrity of a reservation, we won't be back. We have referred people to this resort but never again."
3,4,"This is our 1st time staying here. We are in a RV, the lots are long and wide on a nice gravel bed with cement patios, each site has a palm tree.  
The place is very clean and well maintained, pool area is awesome, 2 pools and a very large hot tub. The main pool is big and warm with several tables built into the side with bench seating for cocktails while in the pool. There is a rock waterfall at one end and nice palm trees surrounding. Nice wicker lounge chairs with pads, and wrought iron picnic tables. Next to the hot tub is a very large fireplace, one of the nicest pool areas I have been to so far.
The whole park is landscaped with tropical palm trees, cactus, and flowering bushes.
There are many activities here in the park like, golf, swimming, pickle ball, tennis, etc. also many crafts, quilting, beading, ceramics, woodworking & just about anything you can think of.
This is a 55 and over park and very quite! Prices are reasonable!
This is a gated community, so we feel pretty safe.
Only 1 draw back, & that is why I am giving it only 4 stars, the garbage pickup is only 2 days a week, and there is no dumpster located in the park to dispose of your garbage if needed in between those 2 days, (which being in an rv you go through a lot of garbage daily).
You need to be careful in the evenings with your pets outside, as there are coyotes that frequent here nightly.
Overall this is a very nice upscale RV park!"
3,5,"Nov 2016.
This is our fourth visit to El Mirage! I have a sister that lives here so when we come to visit each year we always stay at El Mirage.  a very nice facility with plenty of things to do and nice RV spots we have a 40 foot Class A motorhome. It is close to a jet fighter facility. "" it's the sound of freedom!"""
3,1,Course and the people who run it are a joke. Never been so digusted with service. The lady who runs it is beyond rude. Got kicked out the course cause they wanted to go home. My round was only 3.5 hours..serves them right being next to a trailer park
3,3,"We went to the Pueblo El Mirage Country Club for dinner the other night with a group of 11.  Our friend was celebrating a birthday and wanted to enjoy the fish fry. 

The facility is nice and I can see it being transformed into a very elegant location for a wedding. There are loads of tables and booths in the club. 

The food was good enough. Nothing special. The Fish Fry is an all-you-can-eat fry and they do offer baked fish as well along with a choice of regular or sweet potato french fries. You also get a cup of coleslaw. The fish was largely portioned and the sweet potato fries were yummy. The coleslaw was very bland though. 

Service is very slow here at the club though and that's what is keeping me from being terribly excited about it. We waited almost 30 minutes from the time of ordering for us to receive our appetizers and that's really not acceptable. The place was busy but I got the feeling that the wait staff just isn't trained well on time management skills. Our server did try his best and tried to get with the program but just couldn't seem to get his ducks in a row. 

I will go back as the food was good and my husband and son are eager to give the golf course a whirl. Hopefully the service will improve soon!"
3,5,"This is our 1st visit to Pueblo El Mirage, we came here because friends had stopped here a few weeks prior to us. We had been staying in Resorts in the Mesa, AZ area & got tired of just seeing Park Models & concrete. We are pleasantly surprised at the beautiful green grounds & over all appearance of the Resort.  The sites are spacious, clean & our premium site has a nice table & outside area to enjoy.  The jets that others have mentioned have not been an issue for us, we live near an airport & just accept the air noise I guess. The Wi-Fi (for $5.00 a day) is very efficient. All the staff that has crossed our paths are very friendly & personable.  We will return when in the area.    The Passport America rate that went into effect Apr. 1 is a Bonus!"
3,5,"This was a really great stay! The people were super nice, and the campgrounds as well. Everything was clean and well maintained. We got to the resort past closing and thought we might not be let in, but they were super nice and happily let us in. I would definitely recommend this place if you have an RV."
3,4,"I really enjoy this course ! I have played here 3 times in 2 weeks ! Great layout! 

All of the staff is GREAT! Thank you ! 

I will be back again !"
3,4,"Participated in a pickleball tournament here. The staff and people in general were kind, helpful and friendly. The pickleball courts are only a year or so old and are very nice. They have 16 outdoor courts in all. The only drawback here is that the facility is in the direct path of Luke Air Force base military jet flights and the noise is frequent and loud. Other than that, it's a winner."
3,1,"The playability and condition of the course is fair for the price you pay, however the way the course is managed is without a doubt in the 40 years of playing the game the worse I have seen.
Had a tee time of 1:55 for 2 players, checked in at 1:40 and the gentleman told us to go ahead and head to tee #1 and start.  Very nice and friendly.  
got to the tee and there was already a wait, a group in the fairway and on the green.
after a 10min wait we got started, but after each shot had to wait until the group in front of us moved on, this was the normal routine for the entire round.
at the third hole the group behind us caught us at the tee box and asked what are tee time was, told them 1:55, they were mildly upset due to they had a time ahead of ours, we explained to them that the gentleman in the pro shop told us to get started.  They were fine with it just curious.  After short conversation we discovered that the course sets tee times 7min apart, this is insane and would explain the massive wait at each hole.  And this was a weekday afternoon, not even a weekend.  Tee times should be 10-11min.
As we moved along with our round trying to make the best of it, we were approaching the 18th green, time was 5:50, which considering the consistent waiting throughout the day was pretty good time to about have the round completed.
A gentleman who appeared to be a grounds keeper came to us in a cart as we were walking to the green and informed us that there is a $25 fee for turning golf carts in after 5:30.
We explained to him when we started and the constant wait and he said that is the rules and  that the club house closes around 2-3.
First issue is We paid for 18 holes of golf, it stays light until 6:30-6:45.
Why would you even attempt to collect a ridiculous charge like this.
There are too many quality golf courses in the Phoenix area to ever mess with this place again."
3,5,Nice golf course definitely worth the money and drive. The course is in great shape. Staff very very friendly. Haven't played this course in 20 years was pleasantly surprised.
3,1,"Very overpriced and under managed. The place stinks from skunks because there is garbage left out as the ""management"" can't seem to be able to negotiate a waste management contract and there are only pickups twice a week, with a two bag limit. Last night we went to a show here and they had 480 seniors packed in the ballroom with no air conditioning on a 88 F degree day. This place is run like a mom and pop shop but they charge big prices for everything. 

The noise from the air force jets is really loud as they're so low when the pass over, sometimes all day long. 

Sites are dirt/gravel with full hookups WAY in the back of the site. You may require extra hoses for water and sewer. Some sites have a concrete patio and some also have a concrete pad for your vehicle, but there seems to be no  standard. Premium sites also have an 6 x 6 piece of fake grass in front and a concrete patio table, and what the front desk people warn is really slow wifi.

Common areas are nice, bathroom showers need updating, and I would make top down changes in the management. 

RV'ers are an afterthought and their only focus is on selling vastly overpriced mobile homes. I really can't recommend this park for anything more than an overnight stay."
3,4,"After being here a few weeks, I have a few bitches! 
The main problem is the air force base being very very close. It is Luke Air Force Base. The fighter jets are taking off over the resort constantly. They start at 7:00 AM and continue until well after 9:00 PM. And I mean this is every day!  It is so loud when you are outside that you cannot hear anything else or let alone talk to someone.
My other bitch is the garbage service, there is only 2 days a week for garbage pickup and that's it.  There is no dumpster or cans to take your garbage to anywhere in the park, and they let you know that. Plus you cannot have any bags outside period. So you must take it in your car and find a dumpster somewhere else or leave it in the trunk for days until the next pickup.
Other than that the park is nice!"
3,1,The golf course is overpriced for the condition of the course.  I will not play this course again.  The greens are terrible and fairways are weedy.
3,2,"This place is very nice, but it doesn't make up for the rude people running the place. The receptionists when we checked in on 3-25-18 were just rude and annoyed with a few questions we asked. Such as the rate we were paying! Also my husband started talking to the concierges and they were annoyed he didn't come right over to them.The concierges we awesome though. A woman at the front gate was rude 2 days in a row as we waited for UBER to come. Same thing, didn't want to answer any questions. Please understand we have never been here before and of course we are going to have questions. Everyone needs some customer service training at this place, everyone including them would be happier!"
4,5,"So glad we decided to journey out today and found coon bluff. Perfect for a short walk lots of scenery and quiet. The wild salt river horses are amazing and I'm so glad we saw them. I'm disappointed that I found a bag and enough trash to fill it on my quest, but in true local fashion we made our attempt to keep Arizona clean. #locallove"
4,3,"Took my maternity photos here. We came on a Saturday afternoon/early evening and i was a little concerned with the looks of the area. There were quite a few people here camping and people around i wasn't sure if I would be able to find a secluded place. Luckily our photographer was creative in the locations he selected. All of my photos ended up being beautiful. The lighting was perfect and with the water in the background it almost looks like a fake backdrop. 
I think this area is a diamond in the rough, don't be fooled by the looks. The downside was the area was a little dirty, we had to pick up some trash and move it out of the frames and being pregnant I had to use the restroom there twice...let's just say I would have rather ducked behind a tree. Thankfully I carry hand sanitizer on my keychain otherwise there would have been nothing to clean my hands"
4,3,"Small sheltered picnic table filled park. Its a sharp turn off of the highway with ample parking. One can walk out to the peaceful Salt River overlook, but its a little difficult to go down to get access to it.

Saw a gate opening for a Maricopa trail. It was shaded and dotted with lots of wild horse doo doo. A short walk, following the signs led us to an expansive desolate canal. We turned back.

Good place to have a picnic because the amount of flies, bees and birds that can pester are far less here than at the popular Butcher Jones area. I know we're in nature, but there was a notable difference."
4,4,"I took my young son out here to ""unplug"" for a few hours and it was great.  We got to walk right down to the river, he got to use a dip net to catch a few minnows, and the weather was about 15 degrees cooler than where we live.  Don't forget to get your Tonto or Discovery Pass before you get there.  They don't sell them on site."
4,5,"This is an amazing spot for any outdoor activities. Today kayakers, rock climbers, birders, dog walkers, boyscouts, and a school class were all out there. I've been birding out here and we always see tons of species including many migratory birds. The water is beautiful and the campground despite having many tent sites seems spread out and looks like there is plenty of room for everyone. I'm often out there for my classes and people are always friendly and asking us what we're doing. Coming to Coon Bluff is better than any therapy session and a great close place to spend the day romping outdoors!"
3,2,"Authorized Bullydog dealer that doesn't stock bullydog tuners. Bummer, I would have bought it from them today. 
I will say the lady was very nice."
3,5,"I am very thankful I found this shop. I am a new diesel truck owner and unfortunately suffered major engine failure. Matt and his team are extremely knowledgeable, straight forward, and has my best interest. They are not looking to sell you the most expensive product, they are there to educate and provide you a long term reliable truck. They also do performance upgrades to your liking. 
Don't waste your time looking for a diesel shop- this is it!  You will be treated fair and valued as a customer."
3,2,Update: They've diagnosed the vehicle but still do not have a tech to complete the work. We're past 2 weeks now. Will update.
3,4,"I try to write fair reviews because 1 bad experience should not determine the service provided and  unfortunately many on social media use it to burn companies for minor things.

Bullseye has done much of my work for my company for the past couple years.   They have come to my job site, got trucks in and out same day and have really shone on many occasions.  As a family buisness they work very hard and are extremely passionate about their work.   To them running this buisness is a passion and they spend an inordinate amount of time working to help others and in most cases they go above and beyond.   
In saying this I will not return and will not recommend them based on the service they give when things dont work in their favor.   Over the past year I have had them work on my 7.3.  My initial problem was an extreme lack of power.   Matt assured me that we could fix it with a chip and turbo.   I did not want to chip the truck be he explained he could add a chip and it would add power, increase mpg and would not create issues such as excessive smoke.    On his advice we did this work.    It ran great initially but shortly after we had problems.   The truck smoked, shifted poorly and my mpg dropped down to around 11 or 12 mpg.    Fast forward, I have taken the truck back many times with the promise that it would be resolved but each time nothing...   finally I requested an appointment to take the truck in and either fix it or let me take it elsewhere.   I dropped the truck off and a week later not a single item had been addressed.   At a week and a half still nothing, not one item.   I told them I really need my truck but and would be leaving town and could I please have it back when I returned.   When I was out of town I called to check status but not one single phone call was answered, I sent text messages to both Matt and Mellsa and none were returned.   After a few days of this I called from a different number and instantly the phone was answered by Melissa (confirming that she was screening my calls)    when I returned from my trip I came in to pick up my truck and was told they had found the problem 99.9 % certain.  The problem,.......   a bad air filter.   I picked up the truck and first thing I notice was it was completely empty.   I stopped for fuel and drove across town only to have the truck stall in the middle of the 95.  I got it to the side of the road and it wouldn't start but once again no response to texts and no answer to the phone.   2 hours later I was able to start it without any response. (This is after assurances that they had done test drives and it was running much much better and the problem was fixed).  
Finally Matt texted back and his question was ""did you run out of gas?""  No other response, no apology, nothing.     Yesterday I went to get in the truck and it smelled like fuel really bad.    After driving around and the smell getting worse I pulled over and started looking around.   I found a can of starter fluid that had been left by one of their mechanics that had fallen behind the seat and leaked all over the back interior.   I left a message with Matt via text but still no response.   There are a few more issues such as sending my sons truck back onto the street after a brake job with tires that were horribly unsafe. (It is not their job to monitor my sons tires but I would expect that if you take off tires for a brake job and the tires are worn through the radials you would at least bring it to the customers attention.)

After all of this I would still suggest that this is not the situation with all of their repairs and I still believe that they are hard working, honest people, but I am extremely disappointed that for a year they failed to resolve the issue, explore it enough to resolve a very basic issue.   I am also dismayed that from the front end Mellisa would be so childish as to not even answer the phone or provide any info and be angry at me for an unresolved issue that I have paid a fair amount of money on.  Part of being successful in any buisness is not only hard work but customer service and resolving problems as they arise.    There is no excuse for abandoning customers (payment was never an issue. If they recommended a repair I paid without question)   in the end I am sure that they will do what they are very good at and blame the problem on me being a stupid customer. (I have heard this conversation on multiple occasions when a disgruntled customer calls or walks out of their shop)  My hope is that they will read this and instead of trash talking me they will realize this is not an acceptable way to treat customers or friends. (Btw, my truck still stalls when the chip is activated)
My 4 star is based on past history but my experience on my personal truck and abandoning a customer really gets a 1star.   Who knows, maybe if they read this they will finally call back , but somehow I doubt it."
3,1,"I do not recommend using Bullseye Diesel Doctor. They've had my truck for over a week. I hadn't heard a word from them during this time so I called to check on the status. I've been getting the runaround since. They keep repeating over and over again ""We're just so busy. We'll call you later with an update"" but they haven't called. Now they're not taking my calls. Totally unsatisfactory. I'll most likely take the vehicle somewhere else unless this is resolved today. Will update this review if/when it's resolved."
3,1,"Update: 

This is my totally factual experience with Bullseye Diesel Performance: 

My truck would not start and it was not a battery issue so I had it towed to Diesel Doctor which unbeknownst to me is now Bullseye Diesel Performance. They said it would take about 2 weeks to have it done because they were so busy. I said fine. After 2 weeks they hadn't touched the truck. I told them I'd need it soon. After many phone calls and text messages to Matt, really leaning on them, they finished the truck after having it for 23 days. As a side note they told me that I had unrealistic expectations of how fast the work would get done considering how busy they were. 

They changed the starter motor and fuse box for $797 and said it was fixed. Problem is the truck would not start again after I shut it down. I had it towed to Henderson Chevrolet after hours and Henderson Chevrolet had it fixed by 11am the next day. It turns out it was simply the ground wire to the starter motor shorting out and blowing the fuse. $400 for the repair. 

You can judge for yourself whether  Bullseye Diesel Performance deserve more than 1 star but the facts are thus:

-23 days (after much pressuring) to ""fix"" vehicle. 
-$797 spent and the vehicle still was not fixed. 
-Vehicle was totally fixed in less than 1 day for half the price elsewhere. 

I don't know how this experience warrants more than 1 star. I don't plan to pursue getting any compensation from Bullseye Diesel Performance because I did not give them the chance to rectify the situation. Why would I put myself though that all over again? I simply don't have the time to leave my truck with them for another 3 weeks. Sometimes you get burned and this is one of those times."
3,1,This place is great if you don't mind confederate flags everywhere and the feeling that someone would murder you
3,5,"We have been coming here for years. Great place for youngsters and oldsters. Always have lots of activities. I have an older camper myself. Sorry if it doesn't meet some other reviewers standards! It""s camping for goodness sake!!! And by the way, someday YOU will be older too."
3,1,"Drive by this one, dirty, old, nasty seasonal people.
My 20 year old pop up was the newest looking camper in the campground. You'll thank me."
3,5,"Not sure what Candace is talking about. This is a great place for kids. Pool, fishing lake, arcade, playground, kids activities, hayrides. Sounds like a family place to me. Night time is for fires and drinks. Kids should be in bed so the adults can have time to themselves. Regularly have bands that play in the main pavilion. 

Any of the troublemakers are 99% of the time people just here for the weekend. Set up tents and party. Rarely does anything get out of hand. My family has had a permanent site here for 30yrs. Never had even an argument with another regular."
4,5,"Go here! I've rode my bike here from MTL last year and this year opted for the train into Deux Montagnes and the awesome ride from that point! Both are good options and just depends on how much of your day you want to spend biking and how comfortable your bike seat is!

We did the very short trail (Sentier de la Grande Baie) which ends with an awesome wooden bridge out in the water near la Grande Baie. It was very beautiful and highly recommended! From there we rode to the apple picking places on Chemin Principal and then to Gare Deux Montagnes. A great day trip to escape the city!"
4,4,"C'est l'automne. 
Le parc est magnifique. 
L'été, c'est la folie, alors quand on y revient plus tard, c'est un tout autre monde, un monde qu'il fait du bien d'explorer. Quelques marcheurs croisés seulement. Une grande bouffée d'air dans un parc immense. Personnel accueillant et chaleureux. 

Seul hic: Le prix d'entrée, surprenant et élevé. Mais qu'est-ce qu'on ne ferait pas pour préserver nos beaux parcs québécois!"
4,5,"This park is just a short trip from Montreal, which worked really well for a 1/2 day trip. We had already done a longer day trip to Tremlant, so we were looking for an option closer to Montreal for the 2nd morning.

The 4.8 mile hike we did to the scenic overlook was just a slight uphill, making it a casual and easy morning hike with a beautiful view at the top. Then just across the road is a nice beach where we were able to relax after. If you're up for it, there's a 13K hike option that actually ends at the beach and you can jump into the water after. The only down side to this park was in comparison to the untouched beauty of Tremblant we soaked in the day before, Oka seemed a bit more commercial and touched by man. However, its proximity to the city makes it an unbeatable option, especially if you're short on time and want to make sure to not miss the scenic Canadian beauty. Also, don't forget your bathing suit! :)"
4,4,"Situé à une demi-heure de route de Montréal, voici un parc de la SÉPAC qui offre beaucoup malgré sa superficie réduite. Très bien aménagé, cet endroit de verdure propose une grande variété d'activités pour toutes les saisons. L'hiver, le parc d'Oka est réputé pour ses pistes de ski nordique, ainsi que pour son réseau de sentier de raquette. Les skieurs seront heureux d'apprendre que le parc possède une salle de fartage de bonne taille. On y trouve aussi un centre de location, une boutique plein-air et quelques restos et cantines.  

L'été, le parc propose des sentiers de marche, de vélo de montagne ainsi qu'un grand nombre d'emplacement de camping. Je suggère aux passionnés de vélo de s'attaquer à la piste qui monte et descend le calvaire d'Oka. La plage n'est pas médiocre comme le laisse entendre la yelpeuse Virginie B. D'ailleurs, sa critique est très sévère, et sa note d'une étoile est complètement injustifiée. Je l'invite donc à revenir pour goûter aux autres activités qu'offre ce parc. À propos Virginie, ce "" ruisseau "" dont tu parles, est en fait la jonction entre la rivière des Outaouais et le fleuve St-Laurent...   

En conclusion, j'ai visité bien des parcs nationaux et fédéraux, tant au Canada, qu'aux Etats-Unis (state parc). Bons nombre d'entres eux étaient plus imposants en taille et en espace, mais le parc national d'Oka a comme avantage d'offrir beaucoup tout près de la grande ville."
4,4,"Le parc a la plage mais aussi compte avec un ou deux sentier pour randonnées : le calvaire , petite randonnée de 1h aller-retour pour arriver au point de vue qui donne sur le lac de deux montagnes."
4,4,"Ah que ça fait du bien de s'éloigner de la ville pour faire du camping sans avoir à conduire des heures et des heures. Je suis allée la weekend passé, donc oui, j'ai passé mon temps sous la pluie! C'était quand même un super beau terrain de camping.

Les ""foyers"" viennent avec un grill qu'on a utilisé pour cuire tous nos repas, muffin au chocolat inclus! Le bois de feu doit absolument être acheté sur place à cause des règlements et la conservation des espèces du coin mais au moins ça n'est pas trop cher.

On demande à ce que le bruit soit baissé vers 22h puis à 23h on est sensé éteindre le feu. Le premier soir, on a trouvé ça plate, mais le deuxième, on s'est simplement arrangé pour être assez fatigué qu'à 23h tout le monde était dans son sleeping bag. Ça c'est ce que j'appelle ""mission accomplie"" (ou bien on est rendu pas mal plus vieux qu'on se l'imagine!)

Attention aux ratons laveurs. Ils ont 0% peur de vous et ils veulent votre bouffe alors gardée la cachée! La plage du parc est pas mal belle aussi mais j'ai pas grand chose à dire à ce sujet parce qu'avec toute la pluie qu'on a eu, j'ai juste eu le temps de passer voir de quoi ça l'air avant de vouloir être au sec encore!"
4,1,"On m'avait décrit la plage d'Oka comme étant l'une des plus belles des environs de Montréal. Un joyau dans un écrin de verdure. Mouais. En vérité, tu parles d'une arnaque! Un vieux bord de ruisseau avec trois grains de sables qui se battent en duel. Le tout saupoudré du délicat fumet des barbecues familiaux que ces messieurs les papas semblent s'être donnés pour mission de faire cracher le plus de charbon possible! Et que ces messieurs les enfants semblent s'être donné pour mission d'accompagner de leurs douces voix geignardes. Bref, j'ai passé un après-midi presque au grand air et presque calme. Sinon le cadre était plutôt joli (enfin la forêt quoi) et n'a été qu'à peine gâché par la blessure que mon copain s'est faite au pied en marchand sur une saleté dans l'eau.
Bon vous avez compris, pour moi, la plage d' Oka, c'est fini!
Par contre je vous invite vraiment à visiter le reste du parc qui a l'air très sympa et propose de nombreuses activités."
4,5,"Beautiful park located about an hour outside of Montréal.  I went here recently when there was a lot of snow, so it was ideal for participating in some winter sports. I tried snowshoeing, which was a lot of fun! There are a few trails you can choose from, each varying in distance and difficulty. The easier trails take less time to complete and are generally more flat with wider trails. The more difficult trails take much longer to complete, have some small hills, winding trails, and narrow parts. The trails are generally easy to follow, as there are coloured triangular markers and arrows to let you know which way to go and which trail you're on. For snowshoeing, there are 3 main trails:  L'Écureuil (easiest), Le Marais (intermediate), and La Montée (advanced). I tried Le Marais and La Montée, both of which give you lovely views of the forests. The way the sun shines on the trees and colours them is amazing. La Montée goes along the shore of Lac des deux Montagnes- it was a very cold day, but walking along the shore, it felt like summer, the sun was very warm. 

There are plenty of other things to do at the park, such as skiing, hiking, and sledding. At the park you have a beautiful view of  Lac des deux Montagnes, which was completely frozen over. Some people were paragliding on it, I'd never seen that before.

There also seemed to be some camping grounds for in the summer. In the summer you could also go swimming and other aquatic sports, cycling, and hiking. I can only imagine how different it looks in the summer!"
4,4,"Oka park is a great camping experience without having to go too far out of the city.  Yes, it's a HUGE campground, there are hundred upon hundreds of sites, spread out over multiple camping loops.  It's not quite wilderness, but the park has done well to keep things more natural, rather than some of the campgrounds I've visited in the past that are either more ""big open field"" or even worse ""parking lot"".  We like to go to Oka as our first camping trip of the season, to be able to test out our gear.  Each site has a fire pit and picnic table.

There are lots of activities to do: swimming at the beach, cycling on the many bike paths, hiking.  On our last trip we biked over to the ""La Grande Baie"" trail and had a nice time walking it.  The trail leads through a forested area out to . . . wait for it . . . La Grande Baie!  There is a wooden walkway that leads out into the water, and an observation tower.  We really enjoyed this, and it got us away from the crowds at the beach.  Because yes, if it is a nice weekend day, the beach will be packed.

They do rent all kinds of equipment at Oka, including bikes, kayaks and canoes.  There's a convenience store selling all kinds of items, from junk food to camping supplies to wood."
4,4,Very beautiful park near the Oka Cheese factory.   Nice amenities and a pretty lake.   I was there at the beginning of fall and it was so great to see the leaves changing.    They have wifi there - which is kinda a bummer.  When you want to disconnect and be with nature - there shouldn't be wifi to tease your addiction :-)
4.5,5,"Everyone wants a mechanic you can trust after spending over 5 years in the automotive industry no one understands this more then myself. This shop is one in a million. Not only do I take my personal vehicle there I get all my fleet vehicles serviced here. True honest hard working people I will never take my car anywhere else! Mechanics walk you step by step through the issues your car is having, amazing customer service and even better prices! If there was a 6 star ratting I would have given it to them! 

-Very Happy Customer!"
4.5,5,"INTEGRITY

If you want to take your vehicle to a mechanic you can trust, Elite Automotive is the place to go.  I thank my lucky stars, all 5 of them (see my rating above), that I found such an amazing group of people to take my car to when it starts acting up.  They have proven time and again that they are capable of doing the job I expect with exceptional results.  I know they will NOT tell me everything is fine, except the small matter of the ""Johnson rod"" that needs fixing at the very low price of whatever is in my bank account at the moment. ;)   They fix what needs to be fixed and don't throw in any costly surprises when it's time to pick my car up.  They say what they mean and mean what they say!

I highly recommend them.  Honesty is a rare commodity, especially in Las Vegas.  I trust them.  I will continue to take my car to them. I encourage you to do the same.

I am honored to be part of the ELITE family.  Chris and Rob, what else can I say?  I love you, bro(s)  ;-)"
4.5,5,Elite was a place someone recommended to me and I totally agree that this is a honest place to go. I move from California and tried a couple of places and never felt like I was getting good/honest service until now. Rob the owner is great and really appreciate his customers!
4.5,5,Brought my Nissan Murano in for service. Staff was great in diagnosing problem and getting me out of there quickly. Excellent experience from beginning to end so I will definitely return and recommend to friends.
4.5,2,"While the experience was relatively quick and easy, the lack of small details matter.  We swapped out a dying battery. They did not reset the clock.  I also asked for them to swap out the cabin air filter which I provided. Which they did not do."
4.5,5,Great Customer Service! Fast and Easy! TV and WiFi! This place is the place to be with getting your car fixed! I have a 99 Chevy S10 and drive 8 - 9 hours a day all day long... So when I get off work I don't want to deal with complications especially after a long day! I come here all the time to get my oil changed and they have great prices as well.. Elite Automotive and their team are AMAZING! Look no further then Elite Automotive!
4.5,5,"Trust and integrity are what drive me to Elite Automotive each and every visit.  I always walk away feeling confident that they have taken good care my car.  They are quick and efficient, never cutting corners or up selling me.  If you have dealt with other shops in this town, you know that is rare!  I highly recommend Elite Automotive for all of your automotive needs."
4.5,5,"I have NEVER met a more honest mechanic than Rob Confer! This shop is top-notch and I try to send all my friends here. Seriously great, fair prices with a saucy staff; it doesn't get any better than here!! Highly recommend for all your oil changes, brake jobs, tune-ups, etc. :)"
4.5,1,I guess putting an Online request and even calling the shop to speak to someone who said directly that she would make sure I got a reply in the online inquiry i submitted because she was just covering the front desk doesnt warrant a reply or a call back possibly 3 days I've been waiting to hear back
4.5,5,"I finally found a place that I can trust! Rob is AWESOME he took care of me and brought me back to look at my car to show and let me know  what was wrong with it, I've never had that experience before when taking my car to a shop. I was very happy with my experience here and will be coming here for now on with my car! Thanks Rob!!!! :)"
4.5,5,I recently took my cummins 24v to elite to get repaired. I meet Debby up front and personally meet Bryce the mechanic. It was a fresh of breath air meeting the mechanic and having him step me through what he found to be the issue. Bryce is extremely knowledgeable with Diesel engines and felt at ease leaving my truck there. They have an open door policy in the shop so I went in the bay and watched a little bit. If you have a diesel this is the shop for service.
4.5,5,Super honest and straight forward. Would for sure come back again.
4.5,5,"I called to get an estimate on my car and was able to get in on the day. The person that answered the phone was very nice and upbeat. Everyone was very nice and pleasant.  The staff was friendly. The owner's father was great. He came out and greeted my daughter and I.  He was a joy to talk to. It was nice to be in a place that made you feel relaxed. From the moment I walked through the door was a pleasant experience. Sitting on the comfy could helped to take the load off. I was exhausted from going to multiple locations for an estimate. I was NEVER pressured to get work done. The mechanic was very up front about my problem. He even took me in the back to see and explain what my car problems were. Trust me I am not a mechanic, but I was confident with his recommendations. This is a place I will take my car to again. Although it's a business, they treat you like friends."
4.5,5,"Wouldn't let us leave til All was right !!!!
Knowledgeable , professional ,  thorough , 
Such great people , I even invited them to vacation with us !!!!  THANKS BOB !!!"
4.5,5,Elite totally lives up to their name. After moving to Las Vegas we were faced with having to find a new trustworthy mechanic. We did our homework and chose to take our cars to Elite. Well we could not be more thrilled with our find. Absolutely straight up and honest from start to finish. No over selling of what was needed to be done. A detailed explanation to the work needed and an absolutely honest run down of what must happen now and what would need our attention soon. A trustworthy mechanic is a must because there are way too many crooks in this field. We have recommended Elite to friends and their findings have been nothing less than stellar.
4.5,5,"I can't say enough positive about Elite, Ive been a loyal patron for about 4 yrs or more. I bring all my vehicles here for servicing and major work. They are very trustworthy and honest about the work that needs to be done and they do a great job! If I have questions they are right there to help me understand whats going on with my car/truck. I would not go ANYWHERE else for my automotive needs. In my opinion you are being ripped off if you're not coming here for your maintenance and upkeep. Outstanding job Elite!!! Keep up the great work!"
4.5,5,These guys are awesome. Friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommended.  I wouldnt take my cars anywhere else. ( The Meatguys )
4.5,5,"Came to Elite Automotive based on their reviews, and they were extremely honest, very professional, and trustworthy...they replaced our rear brake pads, and did exactly what we asked them to do. I would definitely come back again!"
4.5,5,"Love the people and service here. The owner Rob is knowledgeable and friendly. Bob the service manager treats everyone like family and Bryce the mechanic I worked with is wonderful. He refused to give up until he felt our RV was safe and travel ready. 
I would recommend Elite to all my friends and will do so often. 
Thanks guys so being so great."
4.5,5,"After trying several auto repair shops in town I found Elite Automotive and they have been performing all my repairs for the past 3 years.  I highly recommend this shop to all of my friends & co-workers for their auto repairs, wether its for an oil change or a major repair.  This is an honest shop with good pricing, very knowledgeable mechanics, & a very friendly staff who perform AMAZING customer service.  You will not be disappointed in choosing Elite Automotive to take care of all of your vehicles needs."
4.5,5,Went in for the first time for an oil change. I called around to other shops for prices and Elite's was the best. The staff was friendly and helpful with answering all my questions. They had a really comfortable waiting area with large sofa chairs and tv. I will definitely continue using Elite for all my car needs. Honest and dependable shop.
4.5,5,"Found this place here on Yelp, so glad I did. Definitely will be taking all of our vehicles here for any maintenance.  Had the oil changed this time, and can say that they definitely care about their customers!  Will be telling everyone I know about them...if you're in need of repairs or just an oil change, you'll be happy with this choice!  Thanks Elite!"
4.5,5,Second oil change here and still top of the line service!! Friendly office manager and the owners are great too!!  Very comfortable place to wait while getting my car taken care of. Will never go elsewhere when it's this good!
4.5,5,"These guys are great.  They took great care fixing my Rv and doing a lot of pm work.   I will be back! 

Update. Once again I would give 5 stars  I had my Rv in for ac work and I left a very happy  camper.  Lol"
4.5,5,"It's hard to find honest mechanics and guys that know their stuff and won't bs. Waiting area is nice, cable tv and soft couches. Customer service has been great the times I've been by. Highly recommended. The shop is a little hidden. Some more signage around the area might help people find it easier."
4.5,5,"We have been taking our vehicles to Elite Automotive for years now. We appreciate the honesty when something is in need of repair, and not charging us up the yin yang for the labor. They keep our vehicles running smoothly, and worry free. No dealership prices here for the same or better work. Thanks Elite Automotive for treating us right."
4.5,5,These guys are great.  They took great care fixing my Rv and doing a lot of pm work.   I will be back!
4.5,5,"Great place to have your vehicles repaired and serviced. The owner Rob and his staff are just great, friendly, full of knowledge and make you feel right at home. Can't beat the prices much lower then I was quoted elsewhere and got the work done on time. What else can I say I will see you next time Rob....."
4.5,5,"Gotta say, I'm extremely pleased with the services this automotive mechanic shop provided for us with our car today. They were professional, quick, and willing to get what we needed fixed and at a great price! This is not a paid ad, & I don't usually do reviews for most places, however everyone at this location was super helpful and quick to help with anything we needed. I was also much happier to find that we would actually be charged less than what I initially was told we would have to pay. So that was a nice little surprise today as well. I would definitely recommend coming here to any of my friends. I myself will definitely be returning for future car modification needs. Thank you Team at Elite Automotive! Your work is appreciated."
4.5,5,"They repaired my RV fan belt and belt tensioner,  they had a hard time finding the parts for my out of production chassis but they stuck with it and did get the parts , they did an excellent job, Bryce and Bob are both very professional and their attention to detail is superb highly recommend them."
4.5,5,"It took me far too long to write a review for this place. I came here with my 2 year old son to get an oil change in our Dodge Journey before we went to Disneyland. My 2 year old is not the most patient guy in the world, but they were so sweet to us and even gave him a little car (which he still plays with to this day). It was my first time here and I wanted to use a deal of a $20 oil change, when they gave me my receipt, it said $0. I was shocked! They clearly know how to treat new customers and I was so thankful because being a stay at home Mom $20 is a meal for us, I think it was more appreciated than they will know. 

Unfortunately 2 things ended up being wrong with our car.. but they were honest in saying one of the things didn't have to be fixed right away..but definitely needed to be fixed semi-soon otherwise it could end up damaging the motor (which WAS true according to our mechanic friend in California). One of the problems ended up being worse than I think either of us thought and we had to get a friend to fix our car before we could even head back to vegas. All in all, they seem like a very trustworthy auto shop and when I have the money for the ""it can wait a bit"" problem, I will be going back to Elite for sure."
4.5,5,This place is really great I got in fast and the owner was on site. Pricing was reasonable and they were very nice my window was stuck down they put it up for free and they are fixing it in Monday very on top of every thing and they keep you informed best auto place ever.
4.5,5,"Only one visit so far, but the work was totally on-point and the customer-orientation is fawning. 

I brought in ""custom work,"" something not all auto shops are willing to fool with ... and they took it on graciously and gladly. And they solved the problem ... and in under an hour.

Also, I was offered several leads toward other quality service providers (auto and not) during our convo, just at the mere mention of the topics. And the word ""family"" ... such as ""consider us part of your new Vegas family"" ... was employed several times. 

I expect to return to this shop with more work shortly. This shop should absolutely be on your Henderson auto-service short list!

UPDATE: I've used this shop about six more times since the original review. They take on ANYTHING I throw at them ... and the work Bryce does (or supervises) is flawless! And everyone there, including Debbie (who handles the front-of-house), treats me as though I am a welcome sight whenever I walk through the door. And it's plain to me that these people are honest and they are fair in their pricing. If you have mechanical/electrical automotive needs, you could not possibly go wrong by checking in with these folk as your first stop."
4.5,5,"Great service and great work. I have an older Dodge diesel pick up with a few hundred thousand miles on it.  Needless to say I have to keep the maintenance up on it, and these guys are always up front and honest about the repairs that need to be done.  Just had the injectors replaced and runs like brand new! Pricing is fair and they have never done work that didn't need to be done. Bryce went through the truck when I first took it in a couple of years ago and gave me a comprehensive list of items that will need replacing, should be replaced, and items that I needed to do now. Highly recommended!"
4.5,1,"Went on Yelp to check out ratings for Tint shop ratings. Found Elite Automotive with a five star rating so I decided to call. I called and got a quick quote for window tint from the young lady that answered the phone, it was fairly reasonable $180 for all windows except windshield and beat the other competitions quotes . So I called back and decided to make an appointment for tint under the presumption that I would get my car ceramic tinted for $180 out the door. But when I called back to schedule an appointment gentlemen answered the phone and I told him that I called earlier and was quoted $180 for ceramic tint and I would like to make an appointment. The gentlemen sounded stumped after i told him the quote price. I asked him is that a correct quote because of how he reacted and sounded. He stated that it was a very low price that I was quoted for ceramic but he would honor it anyway. So I made an appointment for that Friday. So Friday I arrived and as I walk into the business and looked around there wasn't anything that says window tinting or any displays of window tint in the lobby. So I was a little startled. So I asked if there was anyone that could help me after the staff saw me walking thru the door but no one greeted me. So I spoke with a young woman and told her I was here for my 11 am tint appointment. She proceeded to tell me that she will call her tint guy to pick up my vehicle and swap his work van for my car. I was like "" WHAT!"" I told her I am not swapping my vehicle for anything. I am staying with my car and mind you I had my 3 year old daughter with me. So I asked her why wasn't I told that you don't have a tint tech on premises? She then stated that because of the dust and grime in their auto garage, that it wasn't a good environment for tinting. So their window tinter is off site and owns his own business and isn""t associated with the company. So since my time was wasted and I had this time alotted out of my busy day I decided to go to the off site tint shop. Couldn""t find it, long story short. I called to get directions and spoke with the tint tech and he was under the assumption that i wanted my windshield done for $180. RIPOFF SCAM!"
4.5,5,"I was looking to get my oil changed and a friend had recommended Elite Automotive Llc. I was very impressed with the business. They were very friendly and were even willing to take me back in the shop to show me what they were doing. I had recommended a couple friends to Elite and they were impressed and pleased with the service Elite Automotive provided. I went back to them just recently to have some work done on my car. Before they started the work, they called me and told me what they were going to do and how much each would cost. Then they gave me the total cost and asked if it was alright to still perform all the work. It's nice to know Elite provides  honest and reliable automotive service. I will most definitely being taking my car back for any future car repairs. Thanks Elite!"
4.5,1,"It was relatively easy to get an appointment for a battery change when I called in which surprised me（it's a warning sign) I specifically asked for an inspection of my car on specific things and asked if those can be done in one visit. I would totally be fine with having to schedule to come in at another time, instead they promised to perform inspection on all the things I asked for plus battery change. So I decided to give it a try rather than calling it in to AAA for a battery change. After couple hours and having to Lyft back and forth from coffee shop, the only thing they did was to change out battery. I could have just stayed at home and called AAA to do the same thing which could saved me time and less expensive that way. Now I know why it was so easy to get an appointment with rhem"
4.5,5,"I went to Elite Automotive after a number of friends had recommended them and they performed above expectation. The owner, Rob and the staff are top notch, friendly, no B.S., and will not oversell you.  They make sure you comfortable and understand what is going on with your car before, during, and after the service.
Get better service for less out of your pocket from a place you can trust is what you will get from Elite."
4.5,5,"Bryce was awesome. Came out and took a look at our turbo and got your up and running in under 24hrs and saved us $3000. Correctly diagnosing the issues and fixing quickly and correctly. This place is great, very helpful and friendly. Even understood why we were in a hurry to get to the Gila and got us out ASAP."
4.5,5,"Found these guys on here(Yelp) so I decided to get them a try, Read some Reviews and was very Impressed, so I decided to bring my Nissan Maxima in to have a CV joint Repaired, Spoke to Rob at first then I received a Call back from Bryce his lead Mechanic, and let me say I was Very Impressed-a Very knowledgeable Technician and very informative about what was going on with my ride. The front office lady was very nice and helpful. I was Very pleased with the Service and pricing.
I will definitely being going back to get other stuff done on my car. Excellent waiting area Nice facility.
I was very  pleased with service.
Elite Automotive understands our needs and appreciates the value of their customers.
Treated like a Family member.

Friendly 
Great prices

4.5,5,"Wow!! I was pleasantly surprised! As a single, older woman, I usually feel taken advantage of when it comes to repairs, auto purchases, etc...these guys were AMAZING!! They were thorough, very fair, friendly, professional, and tried to genuinely help me understand my RV better. I loved the entire experience and will definitely recommend them, and will gladly drive the 30 min to have such an awesome experience!!:)"
4.5,5,"Very honest people. I'm new to owning an R.V. We came in from out of town when our generator gave out on us an hour outside of Phoenix. Our R.V was full of family and it was getting hot very quick inside . There was no way we were going back to California without it getting fixed. I called R.V. Complete and explained our situation. Not only did they help us the next day, but opened an hour early to we wouldn't miss our Nephew play in his first college football game later that day...Here's the best part. They looked over the generator and saw that it was working find..I was only getting low on gas. I didn't know it'll shut down if low on gas...It gets better....""They refused to charge me for their time !!"" That's right..They opened an hour early on a Saturday and refused to charge me a dime...These are some awesome folks. If I lived closer this is where I would go for my R.V needs..."
4.5,1,"We took our 40 ft. Motorhome in to be painted. After 6 weeks, we were told it was done. We were given an estimate of $12,000 and told it would be a thousand more for extras, but when we picked it up, the bill was $15,000! We were not happy to see that the windows, tires and mirrors were filthy. There was overspray on one of the slides and after getting it home discovered that our awning did not work. (They had to remove it to paint) You would think for that amount of money, it would come back in pristine shape. We have asked repeatedly for a warranty on the paint and have yet to receive it. I will not be using their services again."
4.5,5,"This service shop came to our rescue -- the hottest week in the Phoenix area and our surge protector dies on us in our motorhome, thus not able to use our two air conditioners.  Calling our regular service shop in Prescott, the Prescott shop tells us that all the area service shops are backlogged, try Phoenix or Flagstaff shops.  At the recommendation of a mobile RV repair person who answered their phone, we then called the RV Complete facility in north Phoenix.  Tracy at RV Complete tells me, If you can make it down here, we can help you out immediately or at least start troubleshooting, and we have a spot for you to stay in your motorhome WITH ELECTRICITY if need be.  The hottest day of the year so far at 117F, electricity to run any air conditioner is greatly appreciated.  What a relief to hear those reassuring words!  
When we arrived, RV Complete was able to wire bypass our failed surge protector so we could run our air conditioners while we waited the weekend there for the replacement part to arrive.  Thank goodness they were able to help us immediately.  RV Complete even allowed us to stay the additional night at our request as we wished to be sure that all our wiring was holding up among other things.  It was comforting to work with such an accommodating shop.
Location on Bell Rd right off of I-17 was helpful, only it was a wee bit tight with our big 42' rig towing our Jeep, to make that right turn onto the side street where the service entrance was behind the auto sales lot.  Now that we know where RV Complete is, for future repairs we could plan to drive into the rear entrance from the Walmart parking lot straight across that side street."
4.5,4,"My husband and I took our 1994 Georgie Boy Swinger to the RV Complete location on 83rd Ave in Peoria for a Pre-purchase inspection. I was told to ask for Mike, and I'm glad I did. Even though his techs were out to lunch when we got there, he grabbed his list and got to work. He was quick and thorough. He even had a few tips for us first time RV owners.

The list of repairs was short and mostly things we expected. The only down sides are: we didn't get to see the actual checklist and we didn't get actual price quotes for the work.

We will definitely go back to get the work done at RV Complete."
4.5,5,My first in-shop visit for a number of repairs. The staff is real nice to work with. They did an excellent job. I have used their home service a number of times - happy with their work.
4.5,5,"I cannot say enough about how great these guys are to work with. We spent the winter in Surprise last year and discovered them when we needed repairs. As full timers we appreciate the mobile aspect of the work. Mike came out, completed our repairs painlessly and thoroughly. 
Before we were scheduled to leave, we asked them to come out and repair a few things. We also asked him to check our roof. He came down and advised us it was in very sad shape. It had been replaced by the dealer we purchased the rig from about 8 months earlier due to some damage incurred. We were about to leave town for a few days and asked Andy if it could be finished by the time we returned as we were leaving the day after.
Andy called the previous dealership, sent him pictures, and they ended up covering the roof replacement. In addition, the guys had the roof completed when we got back. These guys go the extra mile for you, their rates are fair and the work is spot on. We would literally bring our rig across country to have them work on it."
4.5,1,"Horrible, dishonest, and extremely misleading.  These are just a few ways to describe this business.  My name is Jake Boyer.  I am the owner of Gilbert Poolman LLC.  I have had two shady experiences with this business and will not allow myself to be a victim 3 times around.  The first incident was when I took my personal Tundra into them to get a oil change done.  On the way over my air conditioning was working just fine.  But as I received my keys the mechanic tells me that my air conditioning is blowing out warm air.  When I get into my vehicle I notice something definitely isn't right.  So I take my truck immediately to Auto Zone where they hooked up their gauges and determined I had zero free on in my system.  What?!  This is just minutes after picking my truck up from Serious Fleet and Automotive.  Of course I called them and notified them of my findings and how upset I was over it all.  They agreed to recharge my system at no cost to me.  So I agreed to give them another chance to redeem themselves.  

6 months down the road I just took my same Toyota Tundra into have the front and back brakes serviced.  Here is the thing just a week or two ago I went on a road trip that caused me to have to check all my fluids prior to traveling.  One of which happened to be the radiator coolant levels.  Everything was picture perfect like it always is.  Now fast forward to the recent past.  I took my truck into get an oil change and my brakes done.  Within 48 hours of receiving my truck back from them I am driving in Paradise Valley and I notice my air conditioning is starting to blow warm air.  So I immediately check all my gauges.  Sure enough my temp gauge went into the red zone very quickly.  I was able to pull into a parking garage at Scottsdale Fashion Mall to park my truck for a few hours as I went shopping.  When I came back to my truck a few hours later It had cooled down enough for me to open up the radiator cap.  At which time I discovered my radiator to be absolutely bone dry of any and all water or coolant.  Wow!!  Wow!!  Not again with these clowns.  And although I can't prove it there was no doubt in my mind that Serious Fleet and Automotive was behind this sabotage once again.  So I called Brad with Serious Fleet and informed him of the situation.  Brad assured me that they had security cameras that film each of the bays and that they would be able to review the cameras and come to a definite determination.  Content with that I waited for a response from Brad.  Which I received 24 hours later.  Not good news.  Guess what...  The camera that was focused on my truck at that particular moment in time wasn't working.  Oh no!  There goes my proof these guys damaged my radiator.  So I am now fighting back by writing this review along with a blog on my website.  I am even going to go as far as creating a website to notify the immediate local public about this business and my experience with them.  My radiator is now damaged some how.  Every day I have to add a quarter gallon of water to the radiator.  Never had to do this prior to taking my vehicle to Serious.  I would absolutely positively advise you strongly to choose another mechanics shop to service your vehicle.  These people are gangsters."
4.5,5,Josh runs a great shop.  I have confidence that I am getting great service on what I need and confidence I am not being sold anything I don't need.  Priceless!
4.5,5,"Never would believe a place would say, we are closed but come on in any way and we will take care of you, but that's exactly what Josh did. Awesome place."
4.5,5,"I selected Serious Fleet to perform an anticipated engine replacement as diagnosed by a certain dealership who shall remain nameless. Serious Fleet called me the next morning and informed me the engine was in tip top shape and performed a routine tune up. Their integrity and expertise saved me well over $5,000. I will use Serious Fleet going forward and would enthusiastically recommend them to anyone."
4.5,5,"Brought our old Jeep here.  They found several things during the inspection, repaired the ones I authorized.  A few others can wait for 10K more miles before being addressed.

One thing I liked was that when I called them about a screeching noise after their service they predicted (correctly) that after a few days of driving it would go away.  Apparently a new serpentine belt sometimes does that.

I held off posting this review until I had time to observe the performance for a while.  The screeching is gone.  The brakes still aren't as grabby as I would like, but are better than when I first drove away with them (as they predicted again).

In about 10K miles I will be bringing to them again for the last needed items.  I'll update the review then.  But so far they do seem to know what they are doing, and the Jeep is behaving well."
4.5,5,"These people are amazing! They handle my entire fleet for work and service some of our employees vehicles. The price is never above what we expect and they never try to sell you in extra stuff, if anything they have called the bluff of other mechanics and even told me that they were not the best option to repair my daughters older subaru..they have always exceeded our expectations and met our sometimes impossible deadlines. Thanks again to all of you for coming through for me!"
4.5,5,"I have all of my company vehicles serviced by Serious Fleet Division.  They are very honest, do quality work, educate on the repairs and prices are very fair. The pickup and delivery is nice as well. I feel confident sending my vehicles out on the road after they do oil changes because I get full inspections to catch anything that could leave us on the side of the road."
4.5,5,"Ok these guys are awesome!  Had one vehicle where I thought I was going to be a grand out of pocket on repairs... The team diagnosed the issue and replaced some pressure fittings, pressure washed the engine and got me back on the road!  Problem solved and it was 1/5 of the anticipated price because they took the time to diagnose the vehicle and do it right.  Other places would have replaced the rack and pinion without even thinking to check the pressure fittings.  Then they fixed my jeep with a simple fix.  Again costing way less then I anticipated because they diagnosed the actual problem.  If you are looking for HONEST, Quality auto services this is the place.  Plus Chris's service was great.  He called me every step of the way and kept me informed.  Great job Serious!"
4.5,5,By far the best mechanic shop in the entire valley. They really go the extra mile. They are inexpensive compared to the average mechanic. They do free inspections just to make sure everything is okay and hopefully find a problem to be fixed before it is a BIG PROBLEM. I had a really scary morning with a flat tire and they saved the day and were a very good deal. I have gone here ever since for everything I need done with my car and recommend it to anyone I talk to that needs car work done.
4.5,5,"Everything I experienced from Serious has been a great experience.  I needed an AC service done on my vehicle along with some other minor items that the dealer had quoted me an outrageous price on.  Serious showed up to my work, took my car to their shop, got my AC working again and then quoted me a price MUCH cheaper than the dealer on the multitude of little fixes I needed done.  When everything was done, they returned my car to me with a smile.  Best service I've had in a long time.  I plan on using them again in the future for anything that might pop up."
4.5,5,"Thoroughly pleased with the work done at serious.  I had a bad vibration through my bronco and they had a simple fix; transmission mount. I had my doubts because nothing is ever that simple but they were spot on with the repair. On top of that, best labor rates in town."
4.5,5,"I took my car here because brakes store had told me that my transmission was going and I probably needed an overhaul, after they offered to do it for me on the spot I took my car to Serious so I could get a second opinion.   Josh and his team took a look at my vehicle, gave me an honest assessment and saved me about $800 when they told me that my transmission was fine but found out what the real problem was.  They could have just worked on my transmission and charged me for it but they chose to be honest.  I really appreciate that.   I take my car to Serious now for any needed maintenance and repairs."
4,5,Great service.  Very friendly staff from the start.  Great communication and very reasonable price and timing to get the job done thanks we will be back if we have an accident but hopefully we won't have too.... LOL
4,5,"Outstanding repairs. Took some time and I'm glad it did. My truck turned out marvelous!! Thank you Tabitha for keeping me up to date day by day via text and email. 
Thank you!"
4,5,Great place and great people... they take there time to explain the entire process of the repairs and will replace my windshield while I get my car fixed. Get my car back like brand new.
4,5,"This place is amazing!  Great customer service!  They painted my spoiler for me because it had tons of sun damage and clear coat blistering and it came out great!  The price was on point. Make sure you mention you're military, law enforcement or EMT, if you're actually one of those. Alfonso, you rock!"
4,2,"The customer service for the agent that took  us in and for the reception person was amazing very helpful but that's about the only good part about this place. 

I was recommended here by progressive since I was in a car accident when the car was returned it was missing a lot of pieces luckily my husband noticed all the missing items  so we returned the car.  Then when we got the car back the a/c was not working and when I called the representative made me feel like it was my fault and then advised the machine they filled it up with was being maintenanced  so I should take my car back. Then for the inconvenience she tried to give me a coupon for 50 dollars but I have to spend 150 at there facility. I will never bring my car back there again."
4,5,"We were in an accident recently and needed to get our car repaired 
I looked up car repair shops in our area and found Chaneys
Today we came to pick up our car and I have to say, it looks like a brand new car 
Chaneys was very good about keeping us updated with everything 
I highly recommend it 
Hopefully We won't need to use them again but if we did, it would definitely be Chaneys"
4,1,My insurance referred me to this place. Tried getting my car in for repair and they were rude. Perhaps they were just having a busy day since the lady that answered the phone sounded like I was bothering her. Took my car someplace else for repair.
4,5,"Professional, excellent customer service and workmanship that rivals manufacturer.  Unfortunately I have had to do business with Chaney's not once but a few times.  Each time they exceed my expectations.  If misfortune brings you in need of a great body shop, I encourage you to take it to Chaney's."
4,1,"HORRIBLE!!!!!  Progressive took my car here and I don't know who sucks more Chaney's or Progressive! I was in a t bone accident and I slammed my Jeep into the other car. Progressive took my car here and I advised progressive countless times that my Jeep was riding rough and it was shaky! Well according to the guys at Chaneys it's not doing that. From the looks of it the issues were My bumper was just scratched, my fenders were loose, the window was cracked and the hood had ripples and a few scratches but internal my Jeep was a wreck! Chaneys returned my Jeep with the shake still there, horrible pulling when driving, they were supposed to do an alignment and they weren't sure if they completed it. I took it to Fix Auto and they found Frame Damage, my axel was shot, my motor and transmission mounts were shot! Hmmm send customers away with broken vehicles.... great way to make customers feel safe! Can't count on this company to be honest!"
4,5,"Great ,friendly customer service ..very accomodating with schedules and times. Clean office and the  staff is upbeat and happy/friendly .....best of all...my car was fixed beautifully and in pristine condition! Thanks !"
4,5,Very professional staff. Carrie made sure to call me multiple times after i dropped off my car to update me. Repairs were done in a timely manner and my car looks great! I will definitely recommend Chaney's to my friends and family.
3,2,"This is the 4th time we've stayed here,  but the first time since it's been a KOA. Last time we were here was 2 years ago.  They have since removed much of the grassy spaces & replaced it with brown gravel.  Ugh. We stay here for several nights during the NASCAR races in March,  but I'm ready to find somewhere else.  It stinks. ..sewer?  That's what it smells like.   Side by side rigs. Very close.  Heavy traffic noises, frequent sirens.  Only advantage is its within walking distance to a movie complex & across the  (busy) street to Walmart.  Of course,  there is a casino,  Sam's Town, which might be a plus to most coming to Las Vegas.  Staff friendly enough but they failed to give me the WiFi password.  When I walked up to ask what it was,  the same woman who checked us in said,  ""they should have given that to you when you registered. ""  uh huh.  I was able to log in at the desk, but by the time I walked back to our space,  I'd lost the signal,  which said the KOA Guest was out of range.  I had another option for Sam's Town to purchase Internet for $5.95--that signal was very strong. Double ugh.  And cable TV is fuzzy.  We've had one clear channel."
3,4,"We were on a three week camping road trip to California from Ohio with our Ford Epedition and a pop up camper, mid June through first week of July.  Supposed to spend two nights here just to explore the strip/Vegas. It was usually hot for this time of year and was 120°. The restrooms and shower facilities were nice and well maintained but they were hotter than hades in there. It was impossible to take a shower and feel clean when you sweat again just drying off or drying your hair. We arrived at 10pm and the yellow shirt golf cart patrol man was kind and friendly and took time to help us get to the right location ad they have two areas. The pool was lovely and clean with good facilities around it. The office staff was average on friendliness. Our site was #171 against the cement wall near the Cannery Hotel. It was okayfor a parking lot campground. The restroom building nearest to our site wad out of order which we then found out was for remodeling. Walking with kids all the way to the front with kids and the extreme heat was a bit of a pain but not their fault per say. Over all it was clean and well taken care of with a great price. We saw a wide variety of campers and people visiting the facility."
3,4,Nice people.  Not paved or graveled.  Dogs got bad burs in their hair.  Laundry room was well kept.  No ATM or change machine for the washer/dryers.  We ordered bacon cheeseburgers from the restaurant and they were delicious!  They do not sell beer or wine but you can bring your own.
3,4,"Ok we were recommended to stay here because we needed to stay on Boulder highway. Meh. When I checked in it was your usual KOA employees in their yellow shirts that were very friendly. 

I'm giving this KOA 4 stars because if you pay for say 5 nights and only stay 4 if you come in by 11am they will give you your $ back. I don't know any campground that does that!! Kudos to you Sam's Town KOA. 

They have 2 off leash dog areas and several dog stations. Couple of pools and laundry facilities. Although we used neither but they were available along with showers and restrooms. They have gravel FHU sites some pull thru and many back ins. 

It is close to the airport so you can hear the jets but it's not really bothersome. The trash man comes through every other day and I mean he flies through here like its a race track probably a good 30mph. Zoom...... Posted 5mph. It was really full when we were here didn't look like any full time residents in here if so it didn't show."
3,1,"I received a email message from a David M. for Las Vegas KOA at Sam's Town and the message was, ""Se reciben perros."" With a red box to click on indicating I KNOW THE ANSWER well I don't mainly because I do not speak Spanish and I am not taking a chance on a virus affecting my laptop. However, I did some research and found it's translation  reads ""Dogs are received."" What in the hell does that mean exactly?"
3,2,"I will say that for the most part it is a decent place to park the RV. It is loud with sirens throughout the night, but it is close to the strip and has plenty of places to shop for everyday items close by. I am staying for work and have been there for 2 months. Location was rented to me on a monthly basis for first month, went to renew for second month and it was VERY DIFFICULT to get a hold of the monthly reservation person, I was given excuses of her not being able to take my call for two weeks. She finally answered my call and advised me that the motor home is too old to pay the monthly rate (I can pay a day rate to be there, HHMMMM can we say ripping off customers, SAME MOTOR HOME either way) . I went to renew for a 3rd month as my stay has been extended and i was called and advised that now I cannot stay without paying double to park for the same motor home that has been there for past two months. I would say if you are staying nightly good place to stop, I have heard it is on the HIGH end for cost on campgrounds. If you are staying for a month make sure you read the fine print (at this time I have not found it) about the age of your rig."
3,5,"My husband and I just stayed five nights at this KOA Campground and we really enjoyed it. We found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. We booked our space over the phone with Madelyn, who was very generous with her time. She never made me feel rushed or like an inconvenience. She even checked with the main hotel at Sam's Town and found we had free comped rooms available to us and applied them to our site making our stay almost free! When we arrived, there was a slight bit of confusion with our reservations and Katrina, the person helping us, was having just a little difficulty with the computer program and our reservations as she had only just recently been hired, but she immediately called Madelyn at HOME to make sure everything got worked out...which it did, then hand walked our receipt to our site to make sure we got it. The grounds were clean and well maintained and the maintenance crew was always very friendly. There were two enclosed dog runs and multiple grassy areas for our dog. The campground was surprisingly quiet even though the spaces are close. The showers and bathrooms were clean and well maintained. We did not use the pool or jacuzzi while we were there, but we did walk through the area and they appeared clean and well maintained as well. The KOA is a very short walk to Sam's Town Casino and a short drive to downtown, the strip, and the Premium Outlet Mall North. There is also a Walmart directly across the street if you need to grab a forgotten item. We really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be staying here again."
3,3,"This campground is fine, but not great.  We had to pay extra for a pull-through space (it would have been nice to know that when we prepaid for the reservation).  Also, we prepaid, but since we arrived earlier than the office was open, there was no one to check in with and our reservation wasn't on the ""board.""  Otherwise, clean restrooms and pool area.  Nice park and quiet.  Just some office things to fix."
3,3,They need to trim the trees here they were all over RV when we came in on a pull thru all right for a couple days because of the price but wouldn't stay any longer than that
3,1,"We stay at sams town rv every year,  now that it's KOA prices have gone up,  staff is not as friendly,  park is not at full,  the neighborhood behind the park have a lot of parking dogs and the casino is even not as full.   We are not fans of KOA.  Increase prices for WHAt? We will not be staying here any more."
3,1,"I read all the fine print on this location, but was turned away after driving 5 hours and getting into Las Vegas. They asked what kind of van I had, and immediately cancelled my reservation since I do not have a sink in the van. I did not feel this made any sense, since this location claims to have restroom facilities.
Maybe you could include the sink requirement in the reservations page, and not tell people as they are checking in. Since it was a busy weekend, and I had not thought about making a backup reservation somewhere, my kids and I were left to find a comfy parking spot to sleep in.
I have a longer trip coming up that included KOAs on the route, but they charge $10 a piece to cancel the reservation. I emailed and called the headquarters to get relief, but they would not waive the fees."
3,3,"This campground was very clean and well-kept, with nice restrooms. The laundry room was very large but there were no coin machines to make change for laundry. We had to walk to a casino to get change. I did not notice a playground here either."
3,4,"I don't understand all of the negative reviews. We stayed here Mother's Day evening and found the park to be clean, safe and very accommodating. We did not notice much noise and I am a light sleeper. We would definitely return to this park."
3,2,"We stay here every year for a week on our way home from vacation so we are pretty familiar with the park and have to admit that we're NOT going to stay next year if we can avoid it.  The prices have just gotten to high even with Good Sam discounts.

We stay for the casino and its proximity to the Strip but since the price increase I think we'll try to find something else. 

 The sites are VERY CLOSE together but there is room for all the slides and a place to park our car.  And they have all the basics that KOA'a have, pool, showers, laundry room  cable tv but no wifi. 

We were very upset this year with the price of the WIFI.  Apparently if your close to the pool or store it's free but other than that you have to purchase from  COX cable.  

We like SAMs Town casino ok although old and kinda smokey which I can't stand, so we leave if it gets like that.

So next year it might have to be ROADRUNNER RV park located next door for $18.00 a night."
3,4,Check in process is always easy and the bathrooms are always pretty clean. They are flexible on check out and have someone always there to accept after hours check in. Really nice being next to Sams Town with all the food and entertainment options. We stay here often.
3,4,park is very clean and feels safe considering its located on blouder highway which is very ghetto... security can be seen driving around almost every 10 mins so i felt like my property and family were safe staying here. the bathrooms and showers were outdated but kept clean. the pool area looked nice and well kept. i wouold have given 5 stars if the older lady who answers the phone were a bit more kinder and professional but dealing with the staff in person was easier and were pretty nice. I would stay here again. rates are an ok price for all they have to offer.
3,1,"Stayed here for 2 nights. The shop in the office barely had anything in it. The bathroom was closed for cleaning at the pool so I had to walk all the way to the other side of the park for a shower. The shower I was in was super small with an even tinier area to change in. There was no bench and nothing to put my stuff on. I had to hold my soap, shampoo, conditioner, body washer, face wash, lotion, clothes, towel, hairspray, deodorant, toothbrush and toothpaste all simultaneously. Momma was not pleased and I don't even know how I managed showering properly. There's only one spot for free Wi-Fi. The office, but of course the Wi-Fi isn't working. We tried entering the password they gave us but it kept saying incorrect password. So I spoke to a worker and they just said it's not working and that's it. I was very, very disappointed and no workers did anything to get the Wi-Fi running again after I complained about it not working and they even said tons of people have complained. But hey they have Wi-Fi where you can pay $6 a day to use for each device. I'm ready to send this rv park my data overage bill for this terrible customer service. I will NEVER come here again and I hope everyone else won't until they change their act... Just sayin"
3,5,I just really love this campground it's awesome I appreciate the pool and the hot tub in the enclosed western style would and I like how there's a nice convenient store if you need something but the showers are always clean and big and I like how it across from the across the street is the buffet at Sam's town so I just love coming here and I have nothing bad to say about this place
3,1,"We stayed at the Nellis site for 1 night and moved after that it was so bad. Relatively clean but NOISY.  Major trafdic, cars racing, sirens all night. Who empties trash dumpsters at 6:30 am?? And for the price, put in a WiFi booster for cripes sakes.It stinks even in the pool area and can't get it at all anywhere else.  Sites are all gravel and level at least but definitely not up to KOA standards."
3,2,"Basically a parking lot with a few amenities. Warm, but not hot jacuzzi. Women's restroom has a huge, dripping hole in the ceiling. Constant helicopter traffic. Called to verify that there was a propane grill available for use on site, but there ended up being only a charcoal grill when we needed to use it, with no charcoal for sale in the store. Wouldn't stay here again."
3,2,Very bad neighborhood Police helicopters all night circling helping ground units. 80 % of washers and dryers out of order. They are owned by an outside company and they have trouble getting them fixed. Staff is awesome and very friendly.
3,1,"Worst Rv park since KOA has taken over, given a space that didn't fit our RV, plus I had to tell the guy next to me to move his truck because he was hanging over in my space, we had reservations for 70 foot space , given a 40 foot, our rig with truck is 58 feet, for two days no toilet paper in the men's bathroom plus the stall didn't have locking device on it, this RV has gone down hill since KOA took it over!"
3,3,"The campground was clean, however not enough lights at the back of the campground at night when you are trying to set up camp and its very dark."
3,4,"Showers need serious repair, but free shuttle to the strip and decent casino next door, very friendly owner and staff."
3,3,"We don't stay in KOA parks often because they tend to be higher in price than other (and sometimes better) parks in the area. We stopped at this one to be close to family we were going to visit. 

The Las Vegas KOA at Sam's Town is a destination park. We rate parks as destination when you are staying at the park to visit the surrounding area and not for what the park offers or a park where they have big pools, spas, activities and/or golf courses. Both have their place but usually not when other parks in the same town have both for a similar price. Maybe, they think the casino is the draw-it is a short walk. 

We paid approximately $50 per night for the site. It is really a parking lot with sites and some trees, which are the best part. The sites are small gravel which tracks into everything.  We did have a tree that shaded for part of the day which was nice. Most did not have that kind of tree. The reason for the 3 star is that the sites are so close that you can see into the windows of the next RV, if you didn't keep your shades down. Way too close. They walk out to leave and are inches from your place. 

I doubt if we would stay here again. We usually stay on the other side of town and I would definitely select that park over this one. It is definitely nicer with a few large pools and small but useable gym.  And room to breathe!"
3,1,"Stopped in to make long term reservations. Informed the staff (who was quite friendly) of our requirements.  We have a long trailer with three slides and a really long truck.  We were assigned a space.  We drove to the site and there is NO WAY our trailer, let alone our truck, would fit in the space assigned.  I'm glad we were able to see it before towing our rig there!  Prior to driving to the sight, and trusting the staff, we went ahead and paid a deposit.  After seeing the spot, though, and looking at their other sites which wouldn't work for us, either, we cancelled our reservations and we were informed that there was a $10 'processing fee' with a cancellation.  Would have been nice to know that up front.  I wouldn't have paid when I did.  NOT coming back and if you plan on making reservations without being there, be forewarned.  Your rig may not fit when you do get there."
3,3,Nice campground but long term campers have no respect walking through campsite with dogs and not picking up after there pets!

One worker told me there was the office and the pool to get free Wi-Fi, but another worker said it was only the office. So which is it?  But of course the Wi-Fi isn't working any for both nights. We tried entering the password they gave us but it kept saying incorrect password. So I spoke to a worker and they just said it's not working and that's it. I was very, very disappointed and no workers did anything to get the Wi-Fi running again after I complained about it not working and they even said tons of people have complained.

I left very upset and very disappointed. I'm ready to send this rv park my data overage bill for this terrible customer service. I will NEVER come here again and I hope everyone else won't until they change their act... Just sayin"
3,5,"Great place to RV, feet away from the casino floor...

I'll be back in July!"
3,4,"Pros: close to the casino! Clean bathrooms! 

Cons: no trees!

Overall a great campground... we were only there for one now get on our way to Yosemite but we enjoyed our stay! Staff was friendly when we arrived. I would definitely stay here again!"
3,5,Nice and one of the few RV parks in Las Vegas attached to a casino.  Right next door to Sam's Town Casino.  Very nice and friendly registration agents.  Nice restrooms and showers.  They have a pool and hot tub.  Two dog runs.  Mostly pull-thru sites with space for slide-outs.  Nice spot if visiting the Las Vegas area.  Only complaint I have is the number of broken down washers and dryers in laundry room.
3,3,"Large park right here! Free shuttle to the strip, gambling hall right in the center of this park......It's Vegas. If you're here in an RV, I'm sure you didn't come to sit around the pool sunning your buns!! Although, the pool is nice and not often crowded! If you are coming here, get in a little research. Do not believe that foolish voice giving you directions from your phone! She doesn't know shit! A quick call could save you the pain in the ass of driving around in busy traffic with lousy drivers who have no courtesy!"
3,1,"Crowded is the first thing that comes to mind.   This is like a parking lot for RV's.   They fill up quickly because of the lower rates, but there is nothing but asphalt.  

Great place to go if you enjoy setting up your camping chairs in a parking lot and looking at other RV's."
3,1,"This place isn't worth even one star. Very old facility which has not been updated. Water in shower was often not hot. Everything was clean, just old and shabby."
3,2,"11-13-2014
.
i reserved a space on line for 11-3, the cost of the spot was $26.92.
the next morning we continued on our trip, to return to the area the next monday      11-10, we pulled into the campground and requested a spot (mentioning we had been there the previous monday) they said fine. i paid my bill and they directed me to the second park a block away our space faced the rear of the maintenance building and was not convienant to the casino. when i paid attention to my bill i noticed that the cost for this space was $39.20 (an incerase of over $12.00)
i am not a happy camper.
the stars are for this particular experience, not for the first one or other koa we have stayed at"
3,4,"Not bad of a campground given the location. Lots of options around you for entertainment. There's even a Wal-Mart across the street in case you NEED something. I only wish the bathrooms were updated to give the appearance of being clean, and that there were more than one toilet stall in one of the men's bathrooms. Also, recommend having fire rings and picnic tables to enhance the camp setting. Otherwise, this place was decent enough....after all, what more do you expect from a campground in the middle of a city?"
3,3,A campground five miles east of the Strip but still an urban setting. Pleasant enough but how hot it must be in the summer. Read the fine print: Wifi is only available for a price and only is available in the office and at the pool area.
3,5,This place is awesome! The spaces are roomy and everything is clean! The front office people are so nice! David loves getting to know people and is so helpful and friendly!
3,5,We didn't actually stay here but got to use the pool since the pool at Sam's town was closed. The man you checked into the park with was the nicest person I have ever came into contact with in Vegas. He said he was from New Hampshire and offered us the code to the showers. We were there at night and the place seemed very well patrolled by security. I would defiantly stay here!
3,1,My sons bike was cut from a chain that was attached to our trailer.  When I reported it to the front office the lady was not surprised and said it happens all the time here.  Another couple walking around said another bike was stolen that they heard about.  Beware of bringing bikes to this park apparently someone makes a business of this.  They need to hire security!!! Very upsetting as this is my sons birthday as well.
3,4,"We stayed at Sam's Town KOA for three days in January.  It was our first time camping in a 24-ft trailer.  The staff at Sam's Town was extremely courteous and helpful,walking us through the set-up and explaining the amenities available.  Madelyn and Ed were especially helpful.  We very much enjoyed our visit and would not hesitate to do it again.  It does not compare to camping at a state park,but we are talking about Las Vegas!  Come stay,enjoy spending time with happy people."
3,2,"THINK BEFORE STAYING HERE!! This KOA is 2 different parks. One has more foliage and is just more campground like for people staying for a short stay. It's close to the casino and hotel and seemed nice. The other park, where our rig was is another story. We pulled our trailer into town because we were relocating from California and wanted to use it as a home base while house shopping. As it turns out we found a house on our first visit so basically we ended up leaving the trailer there as a VERY expensive storage for two months. This side of the park is for the ""monthly"" or long term guests. It's pretty much a gravel lot with a few trees, restrooms, a small office and a pool. The restrooms were very clean, the pool ok and the people who work there very nice. The problem is security. When we finally went to get the trailer to move it to regular storage we found our battery had been stolen. My husband is disabled and everything we do is a challenge already but we tried to shrug it off as just one more hurdle. We decided to go to the office and see where the closest place to buy a new one was. I left my husband in the truck and went into the office. On my way in I saw two African American young men come through the back gate of the park which is left open during the day and walk past the office. I didn't really think too much of it. After getting the info I started walking back to the truck when I heard gravel crunching behind me. When I turned to see who was that close to me, one of the young men I had seen earlier grabbed my hand and ripped my iPhone right out out of it and ran! I was, needless to say, shocked and upset. I went into the office and asked if the attendant had seen what happened. The counter faces into the office and not the park so she had not seen anything. By this time I was in tears. She asked if I would like to call the police and I said yes I think so and then I went out to get my husband  from the truck. She was very nice and offered me water, a seat and some tissue. Another couple of workers came and one even rode the cart down the street to see if maybe they had tossed  my phone after they realize they couldn't get into it. They were not able to find it though. In the end we decided against calling the police  choosing rather to get our battery get our trailer and get out of that place. So at the end of the day my two stars are not for the park itself or for the people, or any of the amenities. It is for the security of the park. The back gate opening to a sketchy neighborhood, apparently no cameras anywhere, and the office not having a visual on the campground makes for a not very secure experience. Beware if you decide to stay here to watch your back because clearly no one else is."
3,5,"Just returned to Moab from 5 weeks camping at the Boulder side of KOA Las Vegas. It also has a Nellis side. We prefer Boulder. 

Reluctant to leave once again. Our 4th year and 7th stay. Lovely meandering streets. Spacious sites. Near the way fun, off the strip, Sam's Town Casino and its 16 screen theater on Boulder Highway. Easy to access. Free shuttles to the Strip or Fremont street. 

KOA staff here are seriously terrific. Getting to see staff and growing to care about and interact with them almost daily  is a delightful part of our stay. They gladly help you plan and do stuff. And are pleasant and helpful. 

Lovely pool and hot tub and bathing options. The grounds are well kept up and the golf carted grounds folks are friendly and attentive. 

Met many other interesting and friendly folks here. A Happy Place for us and terrifically convenient. A true respite and enclave. We intend to stay even longer next season. Perhaps sooner. 

(Tips: Boulder Station up the street a mile or so has a better buffet and great benefits for Veterans. KOA Las Vegas also gives Veterans a 15% discount. Appreciated.)"
3,3,"On our way to AZ, staying for three nights and decided to do laundry.  Besides a large percentage of the washers and dryers Out Of Order the washer I did used DID NOT SPIN leaving my clothes dripping!   Contacted fix it guy who was not at all concerned with my predicament but did refund the $1.75 .  I still had to sit and wait for the clothes to complete their wash for the SECOND TIME !!!!  
Also free internet is non existent!!!!
And....   cable TV is horrible, we are using our antenna! 
Very disappointing, Campers should expect and GET the amenities included in our space fee!!! 

On the plus side; the office staff was wonderful helping us get a space in the park we wanted! 
It's still a nice place, great Vegas location, just needs some up keep!"
3,1,"Stayed here before it was a KOA. Maybe it was just me, but the staff seemed friendlier the last time we stayed. When asking about the Wi-Fi the lady was very short and rude. Telling us ""didn't you get a pamphlet when you checked in, all the information you need is in it"". We didn't refer to the pamphlet at first, because we had stayed before. There has been changes since we stayed and didn't realize it. No one told us about the changes, access to the amenities nor the wifi at checked-in, only a drawing from the office to our space. We stay at many RV resorts, the office usually goes over the access to all amenities, whether we stayed before or not. When we asked about information, that was in the pamphlet, it would have been nicer to just go over it with us, instead of telling us to refer the pamphlet. Things have definitely changed since the switch to KOA and not for the better. We will not be staying here again."
3,1,"Just terrible... Should I list everything in order? It doesn't matter. Water pressure is so low, I had to take 5 times as long to get shampoo out if my hair... When we showed up, with a reservation for a large slot, they were ""full"" and could only put us in a slot that wasn't big enough for both us and our tow vehicle.. Which they knew about. Why? Because they gave 2 people in the larger slots late check outs.. A phone call would be nice. I would have told them we were on time for a 2pm arrival.. 
Pay $6 a day for Internet? Are you serious? And it was slow!!!! Then my daughter needs to print out a couple items for Math and that was not even possible?? Seriously?? I wasn't asking for a print out of War and Peace. Just a few Algebra II work sheets.. 
I think the worst of all was the complete disregard for caring one little bit. Happy Thanksgiving to you too!!! I would love to say I will never come here again.. Or recommend it to anyone, but it is the only KOA in Vegas.. Someone should open another one. Maybe up north more close to mount charleston.. Because being next to Sams town casino wasn't all it was cracked up to be either.. 
Terrible! Terrible! Terrible.."
3,5,This is a really nice park next to SAMs town. The pet areas are great. Bathrooms and showers conveniently located. Wonderful swim area. Close to downtown.
3,4,Nice restaurant choices at the casino next door. Great dog park. Nice staff and good security. Spaces are pretty tight. Nice pool. All in all a good Vegas stop.
3,4,"We came the day after christmas and found the place booked up. Our reservations  were handled quickly and getting settled was a breeze. 

Nearby Nellis AFB was the source of several jets taking off, there were helicopters overhead throughout our stay and people were coming and going day and night. If you're looking for peace and quiet, not so much here, at least at this time of year.

I paced off the casino it's about a hundred yards from the entrance of the RV Park and most of it is covered through a multi-story parking garage.

Didn't Charter cable TV but use my antenna and picked up over 50 stations most of them were reruns of westerns and whatnot.

for some reason they didn't give me the go to the bathroom I suppose I could have asked for it find the bathrooms to be heated and in an excellent state of repair inside and out.

overall the campground was very clean the people were well versed and knowledgeable. 

I will return."
3,5,"I stayed in this hotel at the end of Feb. I went for a Wresting event. We checked in, but we had to wait for the room to be clean.. Which was no big deal. I loved the Hotel."
3,3,"Stayed here for a few days. Personally nothing to set the world on fire. Maybe fix holes in cement where people park so you can level out your RV. Husband and son said mens bathroom was messy everytime they went in. Front desk person I checked in with could of been a little more pleasant, just seemed like they were going through the motions. Other than that not much to say about this location..."
3,1,"Traveling in our motor home with our car in tow it is very difficult to back up but my husband being a man of expertise was able to back up and U-turn on the streets several times to finally pull into this KOA at Sam's town it was the worst experience ever! We pulled in off of Nellis my husband gets out there's no one in the office just night forms to fill out so I called and asked the gentleman if he was truly in the office he said, "" yes."" I explained to him that we are here? He said, ""You are at the wrong park!"" So he directed us to meander through the casino where we caught sight of an entrance to the park right from the street which is Bloulder Hwy entrance. Why we were not directed right the first time is beyond me. Thank you, no, never again."
3,5,"This is a KOA. It's not camping, its a place to park your RV while you explore Las Vegas and the surrounding areas. In that regard, it is perfect. It's affordable and the location is close to EVERYTHING. I spent most of my time exploring the areas around Las Vegas rather than the strip. It was great to have a central place to come back to.

The facilities are well maintained. They have a great pool and hot tub, and all the bathrooms are kept super clean. There are two dog parks. There is also a casino and bowling alley within walking distance if you want some entertainment but don't want to drive.

The employees are all super helpful and kind, especially Ross!! Thank you!"
3,4,"Ok, so here's the deal. You can get a buy 3 days and get a day for free. That means you can stay 100 feet from the pool/ hot tub w full hook ups for 100 bucks. Am I wrong? What a deal. 
There's very little shade so if your going in summer make sure your a/c is tip top. Clean bathrooms and friendly people. I like speaking w the German/ Dutch/ English tourists. Very friendly. Clean sites w enough space for your table/ chairs. Btw, bring a table b/c they don't provide one. 
It takes just a couple of minutes walk to the casino. 
This is a hidden gem. Nice buffet. Not great but pretty good. ( if you want great go to the strip and be prepared to pay double or triple)
Get a players card for free and you'll pay 8 bucks for the breakfast buffet, 10 for lunch and 12 for dinner. 
Gem, you say? 
Walmart across the street.( see safety note)
The huge atrium and laser/ water show. 
Bowling alley, movie theaters, TGIF, kids arcade, ice cream shop and deli. 
Why four stars? A strip tip and a serious tip. 
It's not luxurious. Bare bones. Fine w me
I've paid 75-100 bucks a night a premium resorts. 
Much better to save your money. 

Strip tip. They provide a great shuttle bus to the strip. It runs all day to Harrahs and downtown. 
Free and you don't have to take Uber. 

Safety tip. 
Don't go to or park at the Walmart at night. Homeless people, drunks, drugs etc. 
No problems during the day. 
I have gone at night but my wife was nervous. 
They do have security in the park and they drive around 24 hours. 
I've never been worried at the KOA."
3,5,"Kind of weird on the GPS but once we got there was great. Nice showers and pool, very quiet wen we went there plus walking distance to Sam's casino where they have $5 blackjack that we played for hours. Great place to stay!"
1.5,1,Don't even think about taking your car truck or motorcycle there . He will take your money and make up excuses about why your vehicle is not done it could be there for years. I would take my vehicle to the 711 before I forget there. This place deserves a - 5 stars
1.5,1,"I got taken in by this crook for over $1500 in 2004.

I bought my dream car a 1970 coupe DeVille in Vegas and was driving it back to LA.

There was a shorted out headlight switch that stranded me and that I was not aware of until years later.

Got it towed to a shop that was next door David's complete auto destruction 

The other place was closed and my friend was in a hurry.

This ass said I needed a column rebuild.

He rebut it so poorly that the hazard lights would come on when hitting the brake and the steering wheel was out on crooked.  Charged About $500 for this mess.

Then the car ""needed"" a carb rebuild to the tune of $350.

Came back from LA and this ass got the car to overheat 

Left it again and he I stalled a radiator.

It overheated again and this time I ditched the car figuring I'd take the loss of $1500 to this crook and $2300 for the car.

Luckily Vegas barely tows cars and I was later able to retrieve it from. The parking lot I had abandoned it in.

Complained to the state of Nevada about this crook.

Got a letter back and didn't follow up.   I was too angry
   

I was 19 and it was the first time the real world ever wronged me.  

But yeah this guy is a total crook.

His wife crocodile smiled at me when I first came in and an old man was yelling about how David had destroyed his car.

I should have known to leave then and there.

Didn't have cell phones in those days..."
1.5,1,"Brought in a Nissan truck. Was asked if I was sitting down when I was being told the price. I agreed to have the cylinder head repaired, waited and waited and no follow up. Finally "" I "" had to call to find out what was going on.      When I did, i was told ""it was a difficult job"" and took extra time. Can you fix cars or not???  Is that my fault?. Finally after over a month. Got the truck back, drove it home and the valve cover gasket was looped out as if it did not fit, spewed oil all over the place, smoked up the whole place. I took it back had it fixed no charge ""yay"". I drove the truck for one month . And then the engine locked up completely. I brought it back and they refused to look at it.   It sat in the lot untouched 3 weeks and I had to go steal it back. When I got rid of it. The new buyer took the engine apart and said that the internal gaskets used were not gaskets but  some shit out of a tube. And when he glued my engine back together. The ""glue"" gasket beaded off on the inside the engine and contaminated the oil, and clogging the oil pump, seizing my engine that I just got robbed out of 1100 for..       it seems like a lot of tension if you ever walk in. unprofessional, lazy, shotty work and slow, full of excuses.  Better to throw your car in the trash instead of going here.  This was in 1998.     91 gray Nissan pickup."
1.5,1,"Do not bring your car here. I am highly experienced in repairing vehicles, however passing through Las Vegas I needed to get some repair work done that I didn't have the tools for. I was made to feel like an idiot by David who was also being incredibly rude and yelling at his employees. All of David's employees knew and understood that David was a prick and looked at me like ""i'm sorry, we know he is an ass"". I had a pocket full of money that I was ready to spend there for a few repairs while traveling. Even the locals that I talked to knew that he was rude."
1.5,1,"once you take you vehicle to this place david thinks he owns it. a minor repair turns into weeks and months. He keeps asking for more money, but whenever I asked when it was going to be completed, he keeps saying the parts have been ordered. from where mars.He takes your money and sits on your vehicle(holds it for ranson). I told him to stop the repairs,I wanted to pick my car up. He told me he had to charge me the entire amount for the repair because the parts arrived and he couldnt return them. but he couldnt product and invice for the parts or show them to me.WHAT A LIAR. I have got on ever web sight informing the public about the looser shop. what a thief."
1.5,1,I wish I could give zero stars. Took my 2008 Explorer for transmission repair.  1 year later I take to salvo cause transmission is acting up and find out that David forgot to put the o/d ring back on it.  Causing me to destroy my transmission.  David brag about taking care of us fellow military this place is rip off.  They have change their name now to quick auto repair. Same location though.
1.5,5,Dave and his family have treated me like family from the very first moment I have met them. I own an older Motorhome. It needs a lot of work. They have gone above and beyond for me over and over. I am super grateful and will continue to take my old girl to them and refer them to others.
1.5,1,Suck big time!!! Paid in full and  have my  car still since Feb 17 and I still don't have it. Why!!!!! They will give you the run around. Don't do business with them. No stars not even 1
1.5,1,"Avoid this place! We have brought our RV with brake problems in for repair.
We were charged over $300,- for installing  a new airline and fitting. After leaving the shop the RV broke down within 100 miles with the same issue. I checked under the RV and in turned out that all they did was install a cheap connector (5 minute job) and did not replace the airline at all. The hose broke at the exact spot were they placed the connector (see picture).

I called the garage twice and asked for an explanation, both times I was promised to get a call back from the owner, but (now two weeks later) I have not heard back from them. 

This was definitely not a $300,- job and they did a very poor repair on the RV putting me and my family at risk. I suggest to avoid any business with this dishonest company."
4,5,Steve and the other employees went above and beyond Any other business .  Not only did they take the time to help answer my questions. But they gave me good knowledgeable information to help me repair my own Vehicle.  I will refer their business to everyone that I can .  Thank you .
4,1,"Needed an alignment, and this is where I was recommended to go.  I came here many years ago and completely forgot about this place lol.

It's a pretty small shop, very ""established"" feel to it...don't expect glamour or even a comfortable and clean waiting area truthfully.  I preferred just to hang out outside myself.

The rate was about $78 for an alignment, and took about 45min with an appt. 

I was waiting outside watching the mechanic do the work, and noticed he was adjusting every so often, and then taking it for a test drive 2-3 times...I think they do it old school, without a fancy machine to get it ""done"" the first time.

After he was done, I realized he didn't even touch the rear...I asked him about it, and he said they told him it was only a front end alignment!  Not sure who bothers to only get the fronts aligned and not the rear...but since I requested it, he checked it out, and said it was adjusted to the max (my car is lowered), but that it was fine and didn't need adjustment....my front toe was pretty out of wack though, but this is common on a lowered car and I was killing my front tires...rears cambered slightly on the insides.

After driving home, my steering wheel is slightly to the left.  it was to the right before, so I know there was considerable adjusting that was made, but it'll bother me until I call them and ask them to try to fix it again.

Eventually I will find another alignment shop."
4,5,"Recently I brought my car in for some engine repair, A/C repair and brake service.  I was greeted by one of the mechanics, Dave I think his name was.  I had suspected an electrical issue or computer issue.  When I brought it to the dealer they told me an enormous price, $800 approximately to fix...Brought it over to Big A and Dave found that the problem was only a little short in the wire which saved me about 90%.   It's been a year since I had the electrical problem and still no issues.  Thanks Dave and Big A Brake.  You really do find some honest mechanics that are just out to do what is right for people.  You guys kick ass!"
4,5,"We were passing through Las Vegas during an extended trip in our motorhome, and I noticed we had excessive wear on the outside of the front tires. Since we arrived on a Friday afternoon  I thought ""this is really going to be a problem to get this fixed and also keep moving"". But Steve and Colin got us in Saturday AM and had us aligned and ready to go early afternoon exactly as promised. The motorhome is 3 years old and has never steered well since the day we bought it new  - but it does now! What a difference! 

I highly recommend Big A Brake"
4,3,They finally got the issue fixed after the 5th time with our vehicle. Chris is great and has  customer service.
4,5,In my opinion these guys are the very best. I have used them several times for my business auto needs and each time they have been thorough and most importantly honest in their evaluation of what the needs of my trucks were. A very friendly and helpful atmosphere. They did front end work on one of my trucks and I couldn't be happier with how they did a little of their own custom work just to make sure the stock parts lasted as long as possible and the alignment keeps true. Nice Job guys!
4,5,They have fixed both of our cars. We have called around and they are the most adorable and they do a great job!
4,5,"If you need your car fixed this is the place to go. Friendly , pleasant staff and mechanics that know their business. They even do follow up calls to make sure all is okay."
4,5,"2010 Nissan Maxima running rough, ""Service Engine Soon"" light on.  Took a little while, but car running like a top at a reasonable price.  Would highly recommend."
4,5,They inspected the van for free and even showed me exactly what was wrong with the van. I love honesty and the fact that they take care of their customers. I WILL be taking my car their the next time it needs repairs. Thank you Champs!
4,1,"Took my 02 ford f250 in with oil leak.
Was told hpop lines had to be replaced.
Proceeded to have repairs done.
A few days later on my way back to Colorado, 
I had a major oil leak, more like complete oil blowout near Winslow AZ. Had to have my truck and 5th wheel towed to Winslow at my expense.
Ford dealer charged me well over $1000.
Long story short, no help from champs, no 
reimbursements, only referred to some third party warrenty who told me I didn't make a claim on time.
I had no idea of any warranty particulars, was told I had a year to resolve.
Cost me alot to do business with these guys.
Even talked to the owner Champ, emailed all my repair invoices to him twice, and never heard from him or anyone since.
My advice, stay far away if you own a diesel. 
I wouldn't trust them with my lawn mower"
4,5,Champs has been working on our RV for years. Last year they found and fixed a bad knock/rattle in the dash that has been driving me crazy for years. We have them do all our yearly maintenance on the chassis. I recommend them to all my friends.
5,5,"Class Act!

I had a little fender bender with another Bucar's client in their parking lot. Not at all the fault of Bucar's in any way.  The parts manager gave me a nice little gift as a goodwill gesture. That really shows how much they care about their clients. Class act all around.  You're now my ""go to"" guys for anything I need for my trailer."
5,5,"We went shopping for a used trailer to a few dealerships including Bucars last week. Eventually we decided to go with a tent this year but when we are in the market, we will definitely be coming to Bucars! We were really impressed by the attention to detail and service. And plus they are the only people who actually followed up with us a week later. More specifically ask for Scott Graham!"
5,5,What a great experience had at this dealer. Was shopping for a large enough trailer to accommodate having lots of company and kids. Every team member was happy and eager to help us. Kevin was my representative and what a great job he did. Not only did he show us exactly what we were looking for but he even showed us some of the huge model A class motor homes that obviously we would not be buying. Had lots of fun and can't wait to continue doing business in the future.
5,5,"I wish I could remember the name of the guy who helped me in the service department. Maybe JT or JC? Anyways, he was the manager of the parts department and just about the nicest most helpful guy you're ever gonna meet   Took tons of time out to help me find little pieces of what I needed: water filter, pooh slinky etc, and gave me lots of advice. Super kind and made me feel like he had all the time in the world for me. Will be back again forsure."
3,4,"Highly recommended for RV service. 
Very friendly and attentive to my personal emergency-of-the-moment.
Fast and straight forward diagnostic and remedy from a very compassionate shop."
3,1,"Bill H. of West Valley Rv & Marine says on his answer that it wasn't their fault that I'm upset and that they had to charge the fee anyway because they were told to do it.

Them telling me when I get there before they give me the keys for my rental doesn't make this right. I had signed an agreement online, given them my credit card information and I had calculated how much it was going to cost. I specifically waived the insurance online because I was given this option. That means I didn't wanna pay for it so them telling me I had to pay for it at the store is very deceiving. It pretty much means, either you pay the insurance or you don't get the vehicle and if I don't get the vehicle, I can't get my furniture. I understand businesses are struggling these days and everybody wants to make a profit but that's a very disgusting way to make $10.

I suppose you think I could've just canceled my rental right there and then and gone to another company but you have to keep in mind I had already driven there with my husband and my toddler to rent the van and I had already made arrangements to pick up the furniture I had to pick by using this van so the fact that I was told when I got there is actually very deceiving, whether is a $10 fee or a$100 fee,  you can't expect me to re-arrange all of this stuff and go to another company when I had made this arrangement to pick up my furniture weeks ago. It was a 3-4h rental, by the way. I just had to pick up furniture, bring it to my house, bring back the van. Done. Arguing with you at the store, posting a review and answering to your very unprofessional reply is taking longer than picking up my furniture and dropping it off at my house. 

Bottom line's Uhaul can't give you the option to waive a fee online and then charge you that fee when you go to the store to pick up your vehicle. That's just not what I agreed online and my agreement should've been honored. That's deceiving and that's why I'm upset about.

Stay away from this store. They're not honest at all."
3,3,"I drive a very far distance to bring my RV here, and have always been pleased with the work and the prices-except once or twice.
 There are a couple of things I need to mention that will make your experience go more smoothly.
1. Write a list of what you want done.  Make sure to give it to them and make sure that they staple it to the work order.
2. If you want them to check fluids, or belts, or ANYTHING other than what you brought the vehicle in for, don't rely on them doing it.  WRITE IT DOWN.
3.  Call them before you come and get your vehicle, and specifically ask about each item on your list.
4.  Test drive the vehicle yourself before you leave.

Nice people, good prices, NOT DETAIL-ORIENTED."
3,1,1 star is way too much for this place.  Will definitely never come back.
3,1,"We went to West Valley Rv & Marine last Saturday 3-22-14 to pick up a Uhaul cargo van. According to the UHaul website they're an authorized dealer. I explicitly waived the $10 charge for CDW during my online reservation and when we arrived to pick up the cargo van we were told it was a mandatory fee and we had to pay for it. We even spoke to the manager who said it wasn't optional yet, the website gives you the option to waive this charge. Had I known this wasn't optional, I would've gone with a different rental company. We're extremely upset because we believe this is extremely misleading. If I'm given the option to waive this charge online, it should be honored when I pick up the vehicle. I'm never renting from Uhaul again."
3,1,"I don't like writing negative reviews, but feel one is warranted in this case. I made an appointment to have a new toilet installed in my motorhome, 4 days prior for 8 am. When I got there, he suggested I'd have to leave it because it was an all day job. Knowing what is involved I questioned the all-day thing, then found out, they hadn't even ordered the toilet in yet. This might not have been an issue had I been notified when I made the appointment, but not knowing, I hadn't made any arrangements for a ride etc. Out of disgust, I just left.

When I got back home, I called a place I've had work on it in Apache Junction. They had the toilet in stock and told me, if I was there at 8 am the following morning, they'd get me in and out. I was there at 8 am and they took me within about 15 minutes and in an hour, I was out, and he'd also, without prior warning, cleaned my fridge burner.

I won't comment on West Valley's workmanship or pricing as I didn't have them do anything, but I can say I was not impressed at all with their service so will probably not return in the future."
3,5,"Took in our travel trailer to have the air-conditioner serviced, awning repaired, electrical panel door fixed and needed a fuse for the truck. All was done in a timely and professional manner at a fair price. Very satisfied with our experience and recommend for RV and vehicle repairs."
3,5,Monte was able to adjust our sway control/weight distribution system for our new truck in a timely fashion and at a great price.  He's an honest and fair RV mechanic.  Highly recommend Monte !
1,1,Is it possible to give zero stars? Planned a trip for seven people around a rental that was cancelled due to owner in-availability despite my being allowed to instantly book the reservation on their site. Now I'm out the money until the refund comes through with nowhere to stay. Buyer beware I guess
1,1,"In June of 2018, my family and I rented an RV through RVshare. It was the vacation experience from Hell! We paid for a two week rental which cost us $2,000.00 for the RV, $393.00 in required RV insurance, and $150.00 in toll transponder fees that the owners of the RV required. On day one of our vacation, the mechanical problems began! The refrigerator and freezer never chilled down until ten hours later, when we hooked up to electric at the RV campground. All of our food spoiled! We lost over $150.00 of food. Throughout that day, we continued to text the owners of the RV to ask for help since the refrigerator/freezer was not working. They accused us of overfilling the refrigerator! The next day, we traveled to Mammoth Cave National Park. It was 97 degrees outside and within that day, the generator completely stopped working! We had absolutely no air conditioning, and of course no refrigerator/freezer! The inside temperature of the RV quickly climbed to 100+ degrees! Again, we continued to contact the owners. They told us that there was nothing wrong with the RV and that there was no refund! We drove back to the RV campground, and it took 90 minutes to restart the generator! The serious mechanical problems of this RV forced us to return home the next day! As we were unpacking our personal items, the generator shut down again! We contacted the owners to return the RV and to request a refund, but they refused to answer our text messages. Our family vacation that we had planned for a year was completely ruined! We then contacted RVshare. We were told to begin the dispute process. We went through all of the steps of providing evidence of our text message communication, evidence of our RVshare communication, and photo evidence. The owners responded by writing verbal, personal attacks again my family and I, as well as submitting false statements: They actually wrote false statements on the legal forms, AFTER, we returned the RV. We were never given copies of the documents at the time of picking up or upon returning the RV but saw what they had later changed and then submitted to RVshare during the dispute process. We informed RVshare of all of this, yet they refused to honor a refund for the RV that had serious mechanical problems. We lost our family vacation, we lost thousands of dollars, and we lost our vacation days. And to top it all off, RVshare actually removed our review and comments from the website, so now, when customers are considering renting this RV, it shows positive reviews!!"
1,1,"The renters through RVSHARE have demolished my newer nice Mercedes diesel sprinter and their forced insurance WON'T pay!???

They even kept my deposit so I am without a penny in my pocket to repair my wrecked rv!!! Beware!

Also as a renter and owner. Rvshare scams each renter out of over $300 for their HORRIBLE insurance and lies to the renter saying ""the owner demands that you pay rvshare for insurance"" then lies to the owners as if we have no choice but to use their insurance! It's another con they use to pocket money. 

If you rent through them your rv is NOT COVERED!

One more thing....they never answer your emails! They don't have a phone line and absolutely no customer service whatsoever!"
4,5,"I installed outside accent lights on my Montana 5th wheel and wired them directly to the rv house battery. A couple of days later, the lights stopped working. I checked the voltage and found the battery voltage was down to only 5.3 volts. I assumed the battery had crapped out so I called Tom at TNT RV Repair and described the symptoms. He told me that the battery disconnect switch had probably been turned off. He waited on the phone while I checked the switch and sure enough he was right! I turned it back on, checked the battery voltage. 12 volts just like it should be. I offered to pay him for walking me throuhg the trouble shooting but he told me ""No charge"". 
You don't get better than that. I hope good carma follows this guy. It's not often you find someone who helps you like that. Thank you Tom!
William Hulet US Navy retired"
4,1,"Can't tell us how disgusted I am with TNT!  In November 2015 I tried to contact them regarding repairs to my 5th wheel.  No call back for days.  Finally some one called and said they were having issues with their phone.  Ok benefit of the doubt.  Then never heard from them again.  Took the coach to Johnny Walker for repairs.
In June 2016 we started to have problems with one of our A/C units. Called TNT RV and the first thing he said was ""can you take it in somewhere, I'm really busy"". We explained we full time and our coach is our residence.   He finally said he would come out in a couple of days to look at the A/C.  Showed up looked at the unit, took all information and said would get back to us in a couple of days.   That was the last we heard from him.  Called their business number, message said, sorry we are out of the office until June 20th.   Great way to do business.  I have told everyone not to bother with TNT.  0 stars is what they should get."
4,5,"I can't say enough about the honesty and expertise about TNT RV.  We had our air conditioner in the trailer act up.  My husband thought it might be the thermostat but we had business to take care of in Vegas and could not be home.  We have 2 dogs and couldn't risk having it go out while we were gone.  I stayed home and tried calling a couple of mobile RV repair companies.  They quoted outrageous prices just to come out.  I told them it was a 2013 trailer but both hinted that we'd probably need a new air conditioner.  One quoted  $1200 and the other quoted $1800 plus labor!  Tom from TNT RV charged a standard $100 for coming out, replaced the thermostat and gave us all kind of tips on how to utilize our air conditioner without putting a strain on the system! Great guy - very fair .  I would recommend him any day!!"
4,5,"Very good businessman, he makes sure that he does everything with perfection. He has great business ethic. I would highly recommend TNT mobile services"
5,5,Had a great time with the boat in lake mead. Angie was wonderful. Their boat was excellent. She is awesome. Will come back in the future.
5,5,"If it's your first time renting an RV, then RV & Boat rental is the place to go.  The thought of driving and maintaining an RV during EDC was a bit daunting, but Angie and her team answered every questions quickly and informatively.  A tour is given of the RV and they will also show you everything you need to know. I liked that they include silverware, plates, towels, and a few essentials like a hotel would.  They also have add-ons for a small price such as camp chairs and letting them redill water and do the dumping.  Price is definitely of the best value and I would gladly choose to rent from them again in the future. 10/5"
5,5,Extremely accommodating and kind. There was an unexpected problem with our boat rental very close to our date but angie went above and beyond to take care of us.
5,5,Top notch equipment and service. The boat and boards were really great and Angie even gave us a quick lesson on how to set up the boat for wake boarding.  Looking forward to rent from here again
5,5,"Amazing RV, amazing owner. They took the time to explain us everything and when we add questions during our festival they were available to guide us!"
5,5,LOVE!!!  We come towards the end of the season because we have kids and I've heard it gets a little crazy at the beginning. So that means we only get a 4 ish hour float but it seems like plenty of hours to me!!! We got it down pretty good now.  Coolers. Rafts and tubes. Don't forget sheets Incase your rafts get hot!  We have seen wild horses and other wild life. So much fun.
5,5,"Allie was a great guide. Very knowledgable and friendly. In fact, all of the guides seemed very friendly and clearly love what they do.  A fun experience for the whole family. It was nice to have the kids engaged for 3 hours without a cell phone in their hands. We even had an exciting experience of my husband going overboard. Not sure he would agree. We did the half day trip which was plenty for us but she said the second half of the full day had harder rapids. Half day was perfect for us beginners."
5,4,Had so much fun. Easy and fast to rent tubes and ride the bus down. Friendly atmosphere. Some areas had a lot of bugs so bring Off bug spray. You can use a twin size fitted bed sheet to cover your tube to prevent from getting too hot. Bring rope to tie tubes together.
5,5,"As a first-timer I was a bit nervous but this was one of my favorite adventures and I will definitely go again! 
All of the guides were so friendly and welcoming! Aura, our guide, was very knowledgeable about the canyon's history, flora & fauna, and fun stories about living on the river during the rafting season. She made it a truly a fun and exciting trip down the Salt River.  
We did the full day, mostly class III rapids, nice lunch mid-way through. The excitement doesn't end there, the bus ride back is an adventure in itself! 
If you're a first-timer like I was, listen to the safety talk - as a recent inductee to the ""Salt River Swim Team""- I was happy I paid attention! (Seriously though...stay in the boat). Thanks for a fantastic adventure!"
5,5,wow what a fun time never been before it was relaxing and exciting at the same time grate time for the whole family learn about the area and have a grate time try not to fall in Dan was a amazing guide only thing I could ask for was more rapids now Ian look for more place to go
5,5,"My friend had arranged for a kayaking trip for 7 of us for her birthday. We travelled to the canyon from PHX in two cars. Long story short...the other car (being driven by the birthday girl) got lost. They were over two hours late for our 10:00 departure. Salt River Rafting was so laid back, assuring those of us who were on time they would make it work.

The girls finally showed up and SRR fed us lunch and we hit the river. Prester, our guide, was extremely knowledgeable about the local flora and fauna and sights on the river. He was also amazingly tolerant of 7 raunchy girls! Even though our trip was short, I had a blast and got my money's worth. SRR fed us so well - chicken fettuccine Alfredo for dinner, eggs Benedict for breakfast. Flint, one of the guides and chef, did a terrific job. All of the guides are helpful & friendly. 

I can't wait to go back next year."
5,5,"Absolutely awesome trip. The river was down, so the rapids were not as challenging as we'd hoped. But the beauty of the canyon and all the desert vegetation and animals more than made up for it. Our guide, Marco, was knowledgeable of the river, of course, but also the geology, fauna, wildlife and even stories about the Indian tribes whose reservations we rafted through. We originally were only going to do a half day but upgraded at midday since we were having so much fun. I would recommend this company to anyone wanting to raft the Salt River."
5,5,"This was my first time white water rafting and it was a total and complete BLAST! I am so totally hooked! Tarik was our guide for the full days rafting trip. He was completely fun and safe. Gave us every bit of information we needed to stay safe and IN the raft. It was a 12 mile rafting trip and the included lunch was amazing! Chicken Fajitas with all the fixins. The only thing that bother me was the fit of the life jacket, but I'll get my own now that I'm hooked and looking for my next trip. They even do 2 and 3 day trips, my next adventure! The other guides were great! We got into water fights with the other rafts and listening to Matt was something special that cannot be conveyed here. All I can say is that he was entertaining as hell! 

What a GREAT, AWESOME, NOTHING BUT FANTASTIC DAY!!!!!!! Thanks Guys!

Only bummer was that the CD I bought with the pictures of the trip was not usable when I got it home. The CD pictures of their past trips would not open and my trip pictures weren't even on the disc :( I did contact them right away and they are going to email them to me. But, I would have liked to have the disc."
5,4,"We had a blast on our full day trip!  We were lucky enough to get the best guide, Lauren.  She was really knowledgeable and a lot of fun.  The rapids are a great balance of a little scary, a lot of fun, and calm areas to look around at the scenery.  The water was very chilly when it washed over us on waves, highly recommend using one of the wetsuits provided.  Great experience for kids and adults.  Lunch was delicious.  We did have a small issue with the ride on the bus back to our cars at the end, we got stuck, and had a flat tire.  But they were very prepared with a back up plan, so we were on our way without much delay at all."
5,5,"took my wife and teenage daughters along, yes my teenagers..no phone, no nothing...they both said that it was the best day they had had for yonks..."
5,5,"Just back from a wonderful experience with my teenage son on the stunning Salt River.  The SRR guides and staff exceeded expectations at every turn with their knowledge of the most fun paths down the ever changing river, food and transportation logistics, and their true love and stewardship of the amazing geography in which they work.  Thank you for our best rafting trip yet!"
5,5,I took a kayak down the salt with my family. The adventure is real you don't even remember you are about 30 minutes from home. Wild horses cool cool water and the current is fast but not too fast. This is a great place for an adventure. Forget about Colorado river rafting right here in Mesa twenty minutes away.
5,5,"We went yesterday as a family and had a complete blast!! I would definitely recommend going! We had Kelli as a guide and she was fantastic, she kept us all laughing and was really knowledgable about the river and history surrounding it."
5,5,"I went on this trip 2 years ago to try rafting for the first time.  I was very nervous at first, but everyone was very helpful and entertaining. I had so much fun that I am going again this weekend. I cant wait!

Oh, and early on the water is FREEZING. I was the first person to jump in (on my own accord) for the season, but what an adrenaline rush!

I'm looking forward to eventually doing a 3/4/5 day trip!"
4.5,5,By far the best place in Las Vegas to buy a trailer from. I have been in Las Vegas my entire life and have done business with many of there competitors and I can honestly say that Mike Snook and his team are the best in the biz. There product is far superior than there competitors and they stand behind there trailers. Do not shop anywhere else.
4.5,5,Great customer service! We knew exactly what kind of trailer we wanted and Wesley and his crew delivered seemlessly. They fitted it perfectly and drilled tie downs on the spot to anchor our cargo. They went over the entire trailer and made sure it was safe and secure before leaving back to Bullhead City. Awesome experience and we couldn't be happier with our purchase.
4.5,5,"This purchase was a great experience and I'm so grateful that I found TrailersPlus. I was in need of a small 5x8 trailer for my Banana Cart and decided to visit TrailersPlus online where I found exactly what I needed. I arrived at 10am on a Wednesday morning and I was in and out within an hour (during that hour) I  purchased a trailer, had a spare tire installed, the trailer connected for me, inspection done and papers signed. Corey was fantastic, he helped answer my questions and made the process seem less. I would definitely return if I needed another trailer and I would highly recommend TrailersPlus to anyone looking for a trailer."
4.5,5,"Mike helped me pick the perfect trailer!  I have gotten so much joy out of being able to pull my motorcycles to some amazing fun places.  
He is also just a phone call away.   I couldn't figure out how to get the rear stabilizers to come down.  He walked me thru it on the phone.  Good stuff. They rock over there. Thanks Mike"
4.5,5,"I looked around for a reasonably priced utility trailer, including on Craigslist.  When I saw the ad on Craigslist for Trailers Plus, I knew I found what I wanted/needed.  The staff was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable and the transaction was smooth.  If I am in need of a trailer in the future, I will definitely consider returning to Trailers Plus."
4.5,1,"Don't waste your time or money with this company. They bait a switch on Craigslist. They show you pictures of a trailer and a description then when you put a deposit down to hold the trailer they will not give the deposit back even after you show them the Craigslist ad! They are corporate owned by Interstate Group LLC. 
Look them up on RIPOFF.COM. GO ANY WHERE ELSE BUT THERE!!!"
4.5,5,"Friendly guys, good selection, lots of locations too so you can deal with warranty, etc. Come here first!"
3.5,1,Too expensive for zero amenities. Location close to Old Town Scottsdale Arizona the only benefit.
3.5,4,"Stayed here a month and loved it! Hidden away close to Old Town is this peaceful and clean park. Nicely maintained, no complaints about the washer/dryer, didn't use the bathrooms so can't comment there. Fits long rigs but it's a tight fit getting parked. Water pressure is high, use a regulator. Power never went out or anything. Prices are reasonable and moreso long-term. Hope to start again someday!"
3.5,4,"For what it is, the RV park is nice.  They have long term residents and it's no frills. No activities, no pool, no clubhouse, etc. It is located right in the heart of Scottsdale; you can almost walk to Old Town. 

We decided to stay here kind of late on Saturday and the manager was already off duty. He was very accommodating and gave us a spot for a very reasonable price and even assisted my husband in getting our motor home into the spot. My only complaint is that the park is small, so the aisles are narrow and it's hard to navigate the motor home. Throw in some cars parked along the aisle and you have a nightmare! Luckily they had a spot in front!"
3.5,5,"Great place. Went to a party here, met some neighbors, had a bonfire. Cool digs!"
3,5,"I rave about this place to anyone who will listen, SO PLEASE LISTEN!
We had such a wonderful experience with this company!!! My husband and I were wanting a family recreational vehicle for our summer with the kids but one he could use solo when he periodically works out of town.
We were referred by TWO different people to LV Park and Sell.
We were skeptical when we pulled up but was immediately greeted by some very warm smiles.
The owners Mike and his wife Natalie took us through the process of how to get financed, listened to our exact needs and once we saw the ENORMOUS inventory they offered we knew we were in the right place.
There was no high pressured sales pitches or rush decisions to be made. They agreed that this was a big purchase and it needed to be a perfect fit. I'm a little fussy so I appreciated their patience.
Once we picked our home away from home, the paperwork process was SO simple. It was refreshing from an individual sale or a deadly used car lot!!! On top of the great customer service, I did some further research and learned we got a KILLER DEAL!!!!
I was also suprised to learn they offered more than Rec vehicles.
It was a one stop shop. We also picked up a little used car for our teenage daughter for a GREAT VALUE!!!! She was thrilled and we felt great that the car would last her for years!!!
The support staff of Natalie and Mike were outstanding in the logistics of picking up the vehicles and special props to Nick who went above and beyond!!!
I look forward to working with Mike, Natalie and the whole crew over there again soon!!!
Happy Trails!!!"
3,5,Deal with kelly he is very honest thanks for the good deal Kelly you made my wife real happy your friend Stan
3,1,"The guys there were nice enough, but....

They took us to a lot down the road. Let us take our time and look around on our own. Everything was pretty nasty. 

Then took us back to a lot were we started. There were better RVs there. We found one we liked. And wanted to buy it. A 2006 5th wheel. They showed us the NADA report showing that it was valued between $18,000 and $24,000 and they were only asking a great price of $20,000. And was even throwing in a Honda generator that they had no glue was even in the 5th wheel. (actually went out and checked because they didn't believe us) 

When we took in the paper work that they gave us to the bank. I was so embarrassed. She handed it back to me and told me that I was trying to buy a 2006 and the NADA report that I gave here was for a 2008. I called the guy that was helping us at LVPAS and was told that the intake guy did not do his job very well. And that he would send me a new one. The bank didn't care. They ran their own report based on all the options listed on the 2008 report that they supplied. The RV was only worth $16,000 top. 

LAVPAS came back with a new NADA report with a whole bunch more options added to the list, such as surround sound, a 50 in TV and things that were obviously not in that RV. 

In the end they brought the price down a little but still was to high of a price vs value for the bank.  Thank goodness my bank was looking out for me because LVPAS was NOT!!!"
3,1,Do your research before doing any business with those guys. Make sure you read your contract entirely!!

3,5,We bought our RV here and had a great experience. As a first time RV buyer I had a bunch of questions... they took their time and answered each one. I did not feel pressured or rushed. Natalie was very kind and took her time helping us with the purchase.
3,5,I had a great experience with LV Park and Sell and my family and I absolutely love using our travel trailer for the first time over the weekend. Kelly and Nick were so easy to work with and answered all of our questions being so new to the camping scene. Not to mention we were able to look at a few within our small budget and found one with bunks for the kids which we were really hoping for. We could not be happier with it. Thank you!
3,1,"I wish I could give them 0 stars!! What a Bunch of Crooks! I had been talking with Kelly for over 3 weeks and he PROMISED me that he had my motorhome I was looking for and told me the price on the phone. When I showed up to get it, it was a different rv AND the price was over $3,000 more than he told me on the phone. I came all the way from Green Valley to look at it, and they treated me like I was nobody! His answer was ""no, you misheard that price"" after I confirmed with him numerous times! 
 I WILL NEVER do business with them and recommend everyone STAYS AWAY!  COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!"
3,1,"We took our RV into be sold by LVPAS and they did sell the RV in just under 90 days. I got a call from the owner saying he had a solid offer on the RV, but the offer was just over our agreed upon net price, which meant they wouldn't make much on the deal so he asked me if we would take a lower price. We agreed so long as it was the offer he stated to us. 

When we got the paperwork after the sale went through, I saw that the buyers offer was considerably higher than stated on the phone, not to mention that the sales contract had been signed a week prior to the phone call. As a result, we received a check from LVPAS that was substantially less than what we had originally agreed upon. 

I attempted to contact the owner via Certified Mail, but he didn't respond. 

In MY OPINION: I would never do business with LVPAS again as they cheated me out of a substantial amount of money. I believe this was fraudulent and done so on purpose."
2.5,1,I will never take my RV to a place that does not respect and protect its customers property!  Is it corporate policy to leave customer RV's unsecured at night?  SMH
2.5,5,This is the best camping world we have been in. We have had work done and purchased products. Everyone is knowledgeable and friendly. Much needed in this business. Kudos to all of you for making us feel like family.
2.5,5,"Went to camper world on Boulder Highway and had some repair done to my 2012 coachman the air vents on top of my roof was cracked Scott in service took very good care of me, even arrange to get the parts from the other store had everything done very happy
Thank you John Armstrong"
2.5,5,Super helpful Irene was! SO MUCH better than the LVB store! Irene was extremely helpful AND knowledgeable! Thank you Irene for making the Camping World shopping experience wonderful!!
2.5,1,"South Boulder Highway location.  Some of the most rude, ""like we're doing you a favor by being here"" attitudes.  I do not recommend this Camping World to anyone.  I've made 5 major purchases from these folks, including generators, reclining RV chairs and other costly products.  I'm pretty easy-going person, but each time I visit these folks I'm left to feel that they're doing me a favor by serving me.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND CAMPERS patronizing this location."
2.5,2,"In all fairness, I need to write a follow-up.  I ended up contacting an attorney who wrote a letter to CAMPING WORLD (CW) Risk Management.  CW did agree to pay for the repairs to the camper and did so promptly.  My camper was repaired at another RV facility to my satisfaction.  Too bad CW management never reached out to me.  CW Henderson is only a mile from my house."
2.5,1,"Customer service is priceless. I came here looking for a face sun guard. I was the only customer in the store and all 3 employees I saw on the floor were more interested in a car making a u-turn or something in the dirt. 

I felt like I was bothering them with my question as they all gathered by the window. I don't think I'll be back."
2.5,3,"This location is like most other camping worlds.  They have a store as well as a service shop.  The service shop did not seem to be too busy, which seemed unusual for Camping World at this time of year.

We stopped in a couple of times to shop.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They have a wide selection of all items you may need for your RV."
2.5,1,"Appalling customer service. We visited to buy some accessories for our new trailer. The first encounter was with the ""parts man"" that was telling a guy in a very unfriendly way that he only did parts and if he wanted help to go to service. ""Parts man"" promptly disappeared never to be seen again. We shopped and came to check out and the only person at the counter was the same gal that had been on the phone when we first entered. "" On the phone gal"" totally ignored us and the people in line for 10 minutes until we lost patience and asked for help. She disappeared into the back and came out with someone and promptly went back on the phone. Not a good experience but they probably figure that most customers are passing thru so what the heck, who cares."
2.5,1,This place is a waste of time. I had an appointment for 11 am at 11:45 they still haven't gotten my van in for service. The 2 hour job has now taken 4 hours and the I've had to cancel my 3pm appointment because these bozos wasted my day.
2.5,1,I had to make an appointment to get air in my tires.  OK so I did that.  When I arrived on time I was told it would be a few minutes.   An hour and a half later they pull my Rv into the shop  added air and deflated some to the proper specification.   Then charged me about $20.00 just for air.   When I got home all my tires were at the incorrect pressure I used two different gauges so I know it was not me.  Didn't bother going back just bought my own compressor on Amazon.
2.5,1,"This is not going to be a good review. The estimated time of repair was 9 weeks.  It is now 3 months and the body shop has never completely repaired my travel trailer.  I went to pick up the trailer and the shower door was not repaired.  I was told they would order parts, told me parts were ordered, then told they couldn't get them.  After pressuring Alex from Campingworld, he told me parts were found and would be shipped overnight (that was last week) and still don't have parts (4 weeks trying to get only the door repaired).  I begin travelling tomorrow with a duct taped shower door and Alex and his company has the insurance money for parts and repair and the work was not done. Very poor communication from Alex Arias."
2.5,1,"Camping World Henderson NV

I bought my motor home from Camping World in Houston TX and the experience was great even though they had poor reviews. I needed warranty service in the desert and the most convenient option was Camping World Henderson NV. I checked reviews and true to form they were poor. Poor customer service both in the shop and retail. A couple of reviews talked about feeling taken advantage of by the service department. Well, I went with it anyway as it was the house A/C and it was an easy swap out because it was already authorized and shipped by Airexcell. 

I showed up an hour before my appointment and checked in at the service desk with Derrick. I've been working with Derrick over the phone for over a week to get everything lined up and he's been great! All looks good until we get to him telling me Airexcell only authorized 1.5 hours labor to make the swap and anything beyond that is on me. So if the unit was modified or any other work is required the shop rate is $129. hour! WOW that seems a little steep! Anyway I mention that if that's the case I would like to see what has to happen before we spend anything beyond whats been authorized. With the reviews I've read I have this vision of this turning into more than just a quick swap out and at their shop rate adding up quickly. 

They take my keys and bring the rig into the shop with me following. This is where this goes sideways and as the others have mentioned the poor customer service is demonstrated. I mention that because of the limited labor allowance and an interest in seeing how its done I would like to sit quietly and watch. Well, you'd have thought I poked both tech's right in the eye! They became very angry and visibly pissed and basically demanded I leave the shop area. The one guy tells me "" I do these all the time, I know what I'm doing"". At this point I reassure them I wasn't trying make them mad just want to see how the unit is installed. They weren't having any of it so I left. You know maybe these guy's should read their reviews so they would understand why someone might have concerns.  

I wonder around the store for what seems only about 20-30 minutes tops and the older guy with the worst attitude finds me cruising the isles. He takes me out and they have the rig generator running and the A/C on. He has me go in and confirm the unit is working. I put my hand up to the grill which is what Coleman calls a Chill Grill. You can open and close some vent's and control how much goes into the duct system or the living room. It also has filtered air intakes and the grill separates the two air streams so you don't feed cooled air back into the system. The first thing I notice is the cooled air is coming out of the air intakes! Which since I've taken the grill apart before means it was installed backwards! So the guy that claims to ""do these all the time"" doesn't even know which way the grill goes on! Since I know what the problem is and how easy it is to fix I say nothing. My thought is just get out of there and check everything and change the grill out in the parking lot. Who knows what these two would do if I point out they screwed up!

I go back inside to finish up paper work with Derrick. I'm thinking sign something and on my way. Nope, I owe them $ 8 and change for shop towels! Really......whatever, at this point I'm done and just want out of there! I pay up and head out to the parking lot.

I get to the rig and hop in. The generator is still running and A/C is on. There are 2 large what I guess are shop towels on the passenger seat unused. Hmm are these the very important shop towels I paid for and not even used......again whatever. I shut everything down and check everything out. I unscrew the grill and sure enough the inner plate that separates cooled air from intake air is in backwards! I turn it around and screw everything back in place. Now everything is working as it should. 

Unfortunately my second experience with Camping World was not great and I would certainly not use the service department at the Henderson location for anything again. Good customer service is such an easy thing. Much easier than being at odds with a customer. I marvel at how often it's lacking."
2.5,1,Very unhappy with their PR ... asked the man at the counter if they would match their online price ... His response was if I brought him a printed copy ... I live in the NW part of the Vegas valley and it would cost me more to drive home than I would save ... what got me was that he did not even offer to look it up on his computer ... but they have not been very much help most of the time
2.5,5,"We have been to Camping World in every city we visit that has one. My husband loves going in to see what new gadgets they have for RV life. I must say this time we had some items we needed. 

We didn't know Las Vegas had a second Camping World until I checked on Yelp.  The new store is very large with a good sized parking lot.  

They have all the products that the other Camping World have with enough room on the floor for stock. We called about different products and the service was good. 

I would return and recommend this store."
2.5,2,4 employees in store and the only person that can help me is on the phone for 20 mins. What's up with that?? Too bad nobody here give a darn.
2.5,2,"Worst Camping World I've ever been to across the Western United States.  From the time we walked in with our two dogs, no one greeted us, nor offered treats or water to the dogs.  There was no coffee or bottled water to be had.  When I asked where I could get some water for the dogs, an older, nonsmiling woman directed me to a water fountain.  A water fountain?  For dogs?!  My husband said there weren't any RVs for sale that he could see.  There were 3 large double bay doors that faced the frontage road.  They could be dedicated to service and not sales.  But there's no excuse for poor customer service."
2.5,5,Roy was very helpful in getting our furnace situation worked out. Their service is fast and efficient. Highly recommended!
2.5,1,i bought 700$ worth  of satellite  equipment  from this location. i purchased a 13.99$ warranty on my recievers i was  told it was to replace my recievers at any camping world within 2 yrs if there was a problem with  them..after 3 days i had problems with both recievers ( refurbished ) i bought new eqp at full price not broken  or used or open box eqp..i understand not camping worlds fault...its sate providers sending them to camping world..i went in to this location  to exchange my recievers for different recievers.and was told by erica (general  manager) that i had to have something in writing from dish network that they were broke..she was very unprofessional  and rude..she told me i was missing the plastic from around the smart card i explained there was no plastic  she  said not true (saying im lieing )so i went to the back of the store and grab a new box said ill buy this one opened in front of her  no plastic on smart card..i asked for an apology  she laughed and walked away..i cant believe a good sam member and a customer would be treated so badly by a camping world (general manager)..rude ..unprofessional  and snobbish. .
2.5,2,"Since acquiring an RV my husband and I have been to 3 Camping Worlds. The one way out South on Las Vegas Blvd is the one we actually purchased our RV at. This Camping World is WAY out on Boulder Highway. The other one we've been to was in California.

All Camping World's are about the same. I believe most of them have places where they do work on RVs and of course the retail portion. Prices are steep for certain items. You are always going to see the normal price and the ""Good Sam"" price. You must be a member to get that price. We are members.

This particular CW had some pretty poor customer service. My husband inquired with a young lady working the cash register how much wax/cleaning agent we would need to buy in order to wash our RV. She didn't know and asked another individual working there - who also, didn't know. In the end my husband ended up doing math in his head depending upon how big our RV is versus how many liquid ounces, etc. So, the employees were pretty much useless here.

I didn't find the actual store to be bad. Everything was clean and they do have a lot of selection for different items. It's just that I would hope the staff would be a bit more educated on the products."
2.5,5,We got our own RV this week and had the pleasure of calling the parts dept. at this camping world. I had the pleasure of speaking with TONY GIGS. AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!! The nicest guy ever!!! I cannot even say how super duper nice he was...did not try to over sell me....showed us around...super super super great experience. Camping World should be very very very grateful to have Tony as a representative to their company!!! If i could give 20 stars I would!!
2.5,5,"I've been reading through the reviews for Camping World, and I'm one that is not a yelper, but after my dealing with this store and their employees I decided to post a review on my experience.  

First, I understand that you can't please everyone and there will be both great reviews and lousy ones.  Interesting to me, was that the majority of the lousy reviews (not all of them) were from out of state and out of towners.  It is a shame that someone days away in Washington that gives a one star because they won't honor an online price doesn't realize that the online site is a completely separate business and not connected to the Henderson store.  The fact that the Henderson store will HONOR the online price with a print out (like they're supposed to take your word for it?) is beyond me.  

Or how about 2 stars for not providing water for their dogs or coffee for them?  Are you kidding me?  Did you come to buy or service your dogs and have bottled water?  Come on people, of all the reviews that get deleted on here it is a mystery how ones like these survive.

Now my trip to Camping World had me dealing with Derrick at the service counter and Erica the store manager.  I initially had a problem getting a steering stabilizer ordered and almost walked away.  Instead, I met with Erica and explained the situation in a private room and she went above and beyond to rectify it.  She not only listened to what had happened, she heard me and made all of the necessary changes to get my parts installed.  At no time did either Derrick or Erica not own up to what had happened, instead, they went full speed to get me into operation.  

For me, the measure of a good business is not if there are complaints, it's how the complaints are handled once they are made aware of them.  I have been back to this camping world now on numerous occasions and everyone of their employees has been nothing but helpful with a great attitude.  It really makes me wonder when I read another person 6 hours away in Simi Valley can't get any help with 4 employees present when there has never been a time that an employee hasn't bent over backwards to assist me.  

Each Camping World may be independently owned and operated, but if they could clone both Derrick and Erica for their model employees, then I would gladly walk into any Camping World nationwide.  

Believe what you want on here, but this is only my 4th review ever in 5 years, and most people are ever so quick to complain and I wanted to say ""Thank you Camping World!!!""

***  I almost forgot to mention their service department.  Raphael who has been there for 20 years knows more about motorhomes and trailers than any service center I have been to.  Definitely an appointment only, because when you're this good you have to wait in line.  Is he fast?  It took him 30 minutes to install my safe t plus steering stabilizer and I drove away with a new driving experience.  Plus, the best part of a Camping World installation is it is guaranteed for life!!!"
2.5,2,"The store itself is clean and well stocked.

That's it on the good stuff. The customer service is terrible! I was in the store on two occasions this week and both times I felt as though I was an interruption to the cashier.
Someone really needs to work on customer service skill, your making all the stores look bad with your lack of customer service. We are full timer's and have traveled all over the U.S.A and have gone to many different Camping Worlds.

We come up to the cash register, no one in front of us, the phone rings and the cashier answers the phone, we are completely ignored as she speaks to apparently a sales person asking about phone numbers. We wait and wait, she makes a few faces at the phone caller, then finally the call is over. No she doesn't apologize for the wait, asks what she can do for us? How about ring up our order?

We go back a couple days later, because someone decides he wanted something else that he didn't get the first time. This cashier is talking with some other employees then turns to us and looks at us, so I give her our card number, she then asks if we wants to renew it? It's good till 2016 I say, she says, they are required to ask. Okay...

No thanks have a nice day, or anything."
2.5,1,"Well at least CW is consistent.
Consistently poor, rude, unhelpful customer relations, ( apparently ""service"" is not in their vocabulary).
CW Birthday ad features July 22-23 only door busters. The one item I was interested in, a heavy duty cargo floor mat, was nowhere to be found. Once I located an employee in the nearly empty store, he had no idea what I was talking about. I pointed out their ad, he looked on computer and reported ""none in stock""; I asked for a rain check, he called a manager.
Manager to me; ""No rainchecks, they were a one time buy, sold out last week""
But, your add says July 22-23 only door buster.
Manager to me; ""Sorry"", spins, and walks away ... The cashier just shrugged as I walked out."
2.5,3,"We started with our first RV back when we were 21 yrs old.  Camping World has always come thru with having RV supplies.  No complaints with the friendly staff who are mostly knowledgeable with your obscure problems with an RV.  The down side now is that they joined forces with Good Sam's Club.  We were not happy about this since back in the day Good Sam would not insure a young driver.  We couldn't believe that a mature driver at 21 who was responsible enough to fix up and own an RV could not be insured by them verses an elderly (loosing hearing, sight, and reflexes).  Good Sam segregated based on age. To this day we pass the word on about this company.  Now we hope that Camping World still delivers their friendly service to all!!!  Gotta join the Camping World club to enjoy the discounts on products."
2.5,5,"So far everything has been a very pleasant experience with Camping World of Henderson NV.  We had to catch a flight for the holidays and it was days before our appointment, but they let us stay and on our actual appointment day, the mechanic fixed our water in shorter time than expected and plugged our camper in so nothing would get spoiled in our fridge (even though we didn't have much in it to begin with). Bottom line, this camping world is one of the better locations in THE COUNTRY! Great service and very nice staff and customer experience.  We'll be coming back before we head east to get more work done (they seem to have a very flex schedule). 

OffgridOutlaws.com"
2.5,5,"Not sure why the low stars from these other people. The customer service was awesome! Derek was the service guy I was working with. He went out of the way to answer all my questions. (I'm the type of guy who nit-picks) I mean Derek put up with me and all my questions from various times in the day. As far as the work on my trailer, outstanding! I got a lippert 6 point leveling system installed on my 42 ft trailer. Raphael was the the service tech. Man it was like that guy read my mind on how I wanted it done. Very clean and thorough! He took time to answer all my questions before work was done. Highly recommended!!!"
2.5,1,"Vendors beware, Camping World will not pay you if you do any work for them. I am a licensed, insured plumbing contractor that replaced a urinal for them 2 years ago. It them 2 months to pay me so when the new service manager called me out to clear a drain for them I told him I was not happy with how long it took me to get paid the last time. He assured me that things have changed and he would make sure I got paid promptly this time. That was six weeks ago and counting.
I imagine the new general manager and service manager are proud of themselves that they screwed the plumber. 
The previous service manager told me that he saw my truck and took down my phone number in order to hire me because he had gone through many plumbers trying to get his plumbing repaired and they would no longer return his phone calls.
I know what your thinking. Why didn't I get in my truck and leave.? Because I liked the guy and I took a chance.
I am adding this review to the long list of terrible reviews I'm seeing for this company, and having a hard time believing how many there are.
There several RV places in the Las Vegas Valley, you don't need these guys
Be afraid, be very afraid."
2.5,1,"I the worst experience, I was coned into getting a credit card, I was told this was for my good Sam club membership. I'm trying to repair my credit now I have a hard credit inquiry and losing points, every time I go in to the store the counter wants all my info and try's to sell me things I don't want. That is why I very rarely go to the store. Won't happen again."
2.5,3,These folks were okay.  They took care of our problem from another Camping World without a hitch.
2.5,1,"If you want to see the lazy and unhelpful at work go to the Henderson, Nevada service department. I wanted to get my spare tire on my RV inflated and was told that the compressor was not turned on and to go down the street. So even though I am a Good Sam's member, buy their travel insurance, shop at Camping World consistently, they can't turn on their compressor??? What a joke! It is employees like this that need to retire and not ruin a business."
2.5,1,"My camper was STOLEN while it was on CAMPING WORLD, HENDERSON, NEVADA's property. I took my camper in to get an axle replaced.  After about a week, I had to call to check up on the status.  Turns out the axle didn't fit and the service manager was waiting to call me until he had an answer from the axle company. After about another week, I called the axle company myself because They, CW could not seem to put any effort into it. So, I started dealing with them myself.  I called on a Thursday morning asking CW to take a photograph of the axle dataplate.  A couple of hours later, the GM called me and asked if I had picked up the ca,per. No, I replied. She said it was gone.  I contacted the City Police and filed a stolen vehicle report..  The camper was recovered fairly quickly and there was damage to the door handle, the grab handle, a window was cracked and the frame holding the license plate was broken off.  Pretty minor really.  There was about $300 worth of stuff missing, mostly the things used outside...wheel chocks, stabilizing pads, leveling blocks, etc. The management team was less than helpful and their RISK MANAGEMENT TEAM has denied any responsibility.  All I wanted was to get the things fixed that were broken and replace the missing items, maybe about $1,500.  I bought the camper from Camping World.  I will not be purchasing my next one there.  Luckily, there are plenty of RV dealerships out there.  I'll also be asking for a refund of my membership and encourage ALL of my RV friends not to use CW.  Now my wife told me she no longer wants to camp. If you can't trust the people you entrust your property with to service and maintain it, then why bother. I love to camp.  Oh...you can buy just about ALL of your camper/RV supplies on AMAZON."
2.5,1,My wife and I just bought a new toy hauler from this location in LV. Everything was fine until they delivered the coach to us. The young man had no idea on the workings of our new Raptor. The problems grew significantly when we tried to get the issues that we found upon delivery resolved. The service department at this location is terrible. Can't get any information from them and no one seems to really care. After our unit had set for two weeks I got a call that it was ready to be picked up. Once I arrived they had only fixed two of the ten problems and had no answers. Deer in the headlights best describes the employees at this location.
2.5,2,"Just went to Camping World in Henderson after being told by two local propane dealers to go there for our valve repair. We are Good Sam members and liked that they offered a discount. First, from the outside, the store appears to be quite the repair center, with a number of large bays. We went inside because we also needed a sewer hose and a 12v volt fan for our dash. As we browsed, were no staff members around to assist. In fact, the store was vacant of customers. We found what we needed, then went to the service and repair desk to ask a helpful Camping World team member about fixing our broken propane repair valve. The answer was, ""We don't do that here."" - very bluntly. We then asked if they could at least try to fill our tank. Answer, ""we don't carry propane."" No useful information and no helpful advice. We had been to the smaller Camping World in Spokane, Washington where they had indeed filled propane tanks (however they were unable to fill ours and asked us to come back later). When we pressed the Henderson gentleman about where to go for assistance, he said, ""the Las Vegas store."" The next morning we called the Las Vegas Camping World location and were told that, ""No, we don't work on propane tanks."" When we asked if they could recommend someone in the area, the reply was, ""Huh?"" We then struck out on our own and found Vegas Propane - very helpful guys who will fix our valve and send us on our way in 30 minutes. We highly recommend. Our experience with Camping World is that they are a front to sell or extend Good Sam memberships and sell you cute dinnerware and pet supplies."
2.5,1,"My Dometic fridge wasn't working so I took it in for service. The tech I got tried his level best but he wasn't able to diagnose or fix it, so I left with the problem unresolved. Let me be clear: this one-star review is for Camping World, not my tech, because I've learned (from the repair shop that DID fix it) that Camping World has, in the past few years, really gone downhill, and has a very poor reputation in the industry for exploiting their employees! Shame on you, Camping World! I'll not be returning!"
2.5,1,Gave me a quote over the phone for a simple repair. Showed up for the appointment and was asked to give the exact same info I provided over the phone. They had the gall to give me a quote that was almost double what they originally quoted over the phone. Said they entered the info wrong over the phone. Total bait and switch. Left to get service elsewhere. Complete waste of time.
2.5,1,"Pieces of dog crap, from the associates on the floor to the store manager.  Not a single bit of helpful information or service and made the customer out to be the center of the problem.  Brought my trailer in to have new stability jacks and a tow cable replaced.  The jacks I chose for some reason couldn't be used even though they are universal  so I ""needed"" more expensive ones or have my trailer frame drilled.  When i pick up the trailer my left brake light and turn signal do not work.  I change a bulb and still nothing.  When I ask the service department all I get is it worked in my service bay.  No let's take a look, nothing.  After nearly $1200 in repairs/parts it is easy to see they are only about the money, not the customer.  Guesswho won't get $60K plus when I upgrade to a 5th wheel.

Stay away from Camping World Las Vegas."
2,2,"Bought a 07 Jayco featherlight, put 500 $ down, waiting for insurance $ to arrive. Took longer than expected. Dealership called and asked us to put more down, fine. 500$ more. 2 weeks later they start bullying us to finish the deal, so we financed and asked to put 6000$ down, LOL. We refused. 3weeks later they magically have financing we can do. We paid 500 $ for the check up and new battery. What a crock. Right brake light and directional don't work. Awning we had replaced doesn't work well. Of course they did bother to show us those things at delivery. Cleaning consisted of mopping the floor and spraying deodorizer. Toothpaste still in sink from last owners. 
Carol our saleslady was friendly and I felt bad for her having to call us with the owners bully tactics. I paid off the financing 1 week later. No points for you little scammers. Buyer beware here, especially on used trailers. I will think twice before buying from them again."
2,1,"Purchased a Grand Design Toy Hauler had it home less than 4 days air conditioner went out on 2nd day, there were issues scratches on trailer that were not there when we purchased. Took back they broke arm on awning while working on air. When we were able to bring home the genetator was acting up, awning and main slide were not working correctly. We were told that this sometimrs happens, which we were not happy with the customer service that we received except from one of the employees there. He was helpful and informative more than the dealership. I wouldnt recommend.

Now that we have trailer back and have looked it over there is a deep scratch on front where they took out the generator. There also is a loose portion on the bottom rear right. Not real pleased"
2,1,"Heads up!  Just attempted to purchase a trailer!  After we came to a price I was sent to the finance department to do the paperwork.   They added on another $1,000 in nuisance fees for paperwork and final prep cleaning.  Isn't this the service a dealership provides? 

Once the deal was complete, they started cheating against what was discussed and documented in the final agreement.  They attempted to change my Solar System from 160 watt system to an 80 watt system.  They they removed the generator from my trailer, stating that I now have solar and wouldn't need the generator.

When all said and done, I felt as if I need to check the tires and make sure they didn't swap off the new tires for used tires and that other items hadn't been removed from the trailer ""I bought"".

They totally failed in the trust factor, and certainly not a place I will do business with ever again."
2,1,"I wish I could give a minus on the stars. I bought a used RV from them last year. From the day I pulled out of their dealership I've had deep regrets. I paid $5500.00 cash. I have put nearly $4000.00 to get it in condition to go anyplace. I know I cannot get back what I've put into it. When I wrote the owner of this business doing business as Little Dealer Little prices, he said to bad. No offers to make the repairs or refund at least a portion of my costs. I will never recommend anyone to them, ever!  Only if they want to get screwed without being kissed. I work hard for my money and saved to buy something. Just to let some money grabbing jerk take it. Never again! Walk away from this dealer much quicker than you walk in!!"
2,1,"Little Dealer Little Prices - do not shop there

Surprise surprise...lied to again and the camper still isn't done. Promised 5pm today, showed up with the truck loaded, kids and dogs in tow, and NOTHING done. Wow just when you think it can't get worse. Do not buy or take your camper to this place to be fixed or repaired. They have had my camper for 5 months and it is still not done. It took two months to get the cost of repairs estimated, and even that was instigated by us asking for progress to be made. By the way they fired the lady who took in my camper because she was not doing her job right. Then the service manager took over and said he can get it done. Rick started off good but like the rest of the dealership fell short. I was told by Rick my camper wold be done on 09/29/20017. Not done and he also does not know if he will get it done this week. I would not even buy toilet paper from this company. I will post this everyday on every social media page I can find until they get my camper done and make this right. Do not shop or buy from this company. Five months, money waiting to be paid to fix this thing, and still NOTHING. Ridiculous.still not fixed I was told it was going to be done last week"
2,1,"I would not recommend little dealer to anyone.  We purchased our Raptor Trailer which is a 70,000 trailer from little dealer.  First the price we agreed on was not what was on the financing paper when we went in.  Then there were several punch list items.  Two big ones...the fuel gauge for the generator was not work and the AC unit was only blowing air not cool AC air.  We made an apt to bring our trailer in.  That took 8 weeks to get an appointment from the purchase date.  When we arrived we were told it would be 3-4 weeks before they could even look at it...what was the purpose of the appointment.   This place is a joke.  They clearly have no management or incompetent managers."
2,5,Service department was great. Had an issue with my 5th wheel while going on a trip. Stopped in here and Yokes was able to get me back on the road in 20 mins. Saved my vacation!
2,1,"Eek!  Me thinks not!  I've tried on three separate occasions during a four-month timeframe to do business with this store.  Each time with a different department - sales, service, and parts.  In all cases my business went elsewhere, receiving a level of customer service I am accustomed to.  Too bad cuz they're so close to me."
2,5,Allie in the service department is awesome.  I had my trailer in for repairs and waiting 2 months for a part and she would call me every week letting me know the status.  She is a real benefit to the little dealer little prices organization.  Jeff Marsh
2,1,I am so over going to this location we NEVER GET HELP..and when we go ask someone to help we are a inconvience we have been to this location a few different times and well i am my family will never i repeat never return to this particular location
2,5,"Had work done at shop by Gary. He walked me through repair, gave me additional information and took time to give me what I needed to know about an unrelated issue.
Great job Gary, and thanks for all your information.
This is a follow up to last post where the service people got'er done"
2,1,"I purchased a used 25' toy hauler from them and I've had nothing but problems ever since.  From the walk-through to the service intake to the repair tech to the employee turnover.  This place is a mess.  I brought it in for a water leak five separate times.  The first time they told me it would be ready in a couple of days.  Three weeks later and every single excuse you could imagine, I had it back.  It was leaking again by the time I got it home.  Do yourself a favor and go anywhere (and I mean ANYWHERE) else."
2,2,"We went there looking for our second RV, the first one did not seem to fit our current needs.  We ended up buy a 2016 Forest River Vengeance.  The salesman we dealt with was Ronnie Dye.  

To start, Ronnie was the best salesman I had encountered in years.  He did his job and sold me, but he was also showed that he cared and wanted to meet our needs.  We walked around a few times until we found the RV we wanted.  Ronnie was not pushy, but like a friend.  He talked to us about our needs and what would fit, put in his recommendations and left us to decide.  We started the paperwork and came into a few snags.  Needless to say we actually bought the RV 2 months after we decided on the vengeance.  We went back and forth as couples do, will this one fit, will it suit us, will we be happy with this one, where are we going and can we pull it?  Ronnie, patiently waited as we were all over the place.  We had a deposit on the RV and he continued to check in and ensure that we were good with what ever we decided.  There was no pressure from his side.  If this review was to end here it would be 5 stars.  We were 100% satisfied with Ronnie as our salesman.

Now we just finished our purchase paperwork and go for the walk through.  Ronnie passes us off to the service department and we walked out to the RV under the carport.  The guy starts talking about the battery and takes us to the left side of the RV.  Points out the water hookups.  I ask where is the city water hook up and he looked confused.  He pointed to my black water clean hookup.  I knew from this point it was going to be a cluster....  He finally figures out the fresh water hookup.  We walk further he points at the hot water heater, and knows nothing about it.  We continue as we walk inside he begins to tell us how he jumped through his butt to get this ready the day prior and we did not show up till today.  My wife noticed he kept looking at his watch like we were wasting his time, which began to frustrate us.  Who wants to pay all this money and be given half the information.  Anyway, I pointed out a damaged cabinet door, and he said we will order it.  Which is understood, but then I asked about a ladder for the bunks, he said it was here earlier, don't worry I will get you one.  We watch him walk to another RV and come back with a ladder.  I grabbed a light cover and asked if it was cleaned he said yes he did it and that was factory dirt.  He then says do not ask me about your convection oven I don't know anything about it.  He struggled getting the stove lit so he pulls out his lighter and lights it, then says there it works.  I say it is suppose to work by the knob and I continue to mess with them until they work.  By this point we are at our limits with this guy and sign his paperwork so he can get away from us.  We then walk into the parts area to spend our $50 coupon, and he still following us around.  My wife grabbed a step stool so she can reach the cabinets and he says wait that one only holds 300lbs, I think the 1000lbs is over here, then laughs.  At that moment he is lucky my wife grabbed my hand and we walked out.  So this is mostly why they are only getting a 2 star review.  It does not end there....

So we get the RV home and I hook it all up.  We are going through things, like the electric door lock, no batteries.  Really.... I pay all this money and you screw me on 6 AA batteries.  Fine!!!  Next the hot water heater does not work.  I am going through the paperwork trying to figure it out.  No luck.  I then call Ronnie who puts me in touch with a gentleman named Dave who tries to help.  I give credit to Ronnie and Dave for trying to do the right thing.  The sad part is, it still does not work.  Now they are telling me I need to bring it back to them to fix.  which could take a couple of days.  Why?? You should come to me since I drove 45 minutes to do business with you, and your incompetent tour guide could not figure anything out.  I really feel shorted by not having this fully functional and it not being tested since you had to jump through your butt to get it ready a day early!!!! 

So today is day three that we had my new RV.  We like it and wish our hot water heater worked.  I truly believe Little Dealers should send me a Tech, or pay for one of my choice to come and fix this issue.  Secondly, we really appreciated Ronnie as a salesman, he is highly recommended."
2,1,"This review pertains to the service department. Do not allow  Phil to be your service writer! Demand a different service writer. With that being said, the only reason I'm giving them at least one star is because of Cliff, the man that actually worked on our trailer and did an amazing job!  I would call him an artist.
Back to Phil, he will not return your phone calls, he lies, and he does not keep you up to date on the progress of your job. All the while he acts like he is doing you a favor. I don't know why he continues to be employed by Little Dealer.  I was told by another service writer and by the service manager that Phil was ""the problem child of the department"". They have received several complaints about him. 
Nobody else should have to suffer through this. We have had to drive to Phoenix,  209 miles away, twice to get answers.
Our trailer has been at the facility since Memorial day weekend.  It should be done next week,  9/19/15. We had the floors redone and walls repanelled plus had an electric bed lift put in. We were supposed to go on vacation with the trailor on July 15, but because Phil didn't communicate with us (or appear to do anything else) for the first month, we weren't able to. We were not told this until the end of June that it wouldn't even be possible. That information was given to us by another service writer while Phil was on vacation.  Not by Phil, even though he was reminded a few times of our plans, before HE got to go on vacation. 
Just make your life easier and go somewhere else."
2,5,"I went here for them to check the malfunctioning AC on my trailer. I was entertained well by the staff and sent me to the technicians. They promptly checked everything! The problem was identified; it was a bad compressor and needed to replace the AC power unit. It was replaced within a few days. Now, everything is working well! It was a great pleasure knowing these people. Nowadays, it's hard to find a better company that provides good quality service."
2,1,Brought my van in to see if they would do the repairs and was told by the general manager that they would.  Ordered the part and called to schedule the work and was rudely told by the service manager that they wouldn't do it.  What a waste of time!
2,5,"Took my camper here for some warranty work.  Dropped it off at the beginning of December for a few things.  The repairs i figured would take awhile since the holidays were coming up and when dropping it off the service tech Jason told me it will likely take awhile because of the holidays.  I was fine with waiting as i wanted the issues taken care of.   Jason called me every week to let me know what the status of the repairs were which i liked because i like to be involved in what was happening.  The camper was fixed and everything looked good so there's nothing to complain about.  

I did not purchase anything here but when i was there for some service work the lot was full of campers.  Looked like there is a good selection to look at."
2,1,"For 2 days I had phone conversations regarding 3 motorhomes for sale.  Made arrangements to see the motorhomes on day 3.  Got there and they couldn't find one of them, had no idea where it was. One was a dog and the other I decided to test drive. Had to wait 20 minutes for them to come up with a gas voucher because it was on empty and they don't have a petty cash drawer. Started to go and found the A/C up front did not work, (it was 113 that day) drove to the gas station, the salespeople didn't know where the gas tank was or how to get to it. I had to tell them to look under the plate. In the meantime I told them (there were 2 of them) to fire up the generator to make sure the other a/c units worked. They spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to do that. I finally left and they were still trying to get it going.  What a bunch of idiots !  I wouldn't buy anything from them they have no idea what they're doing.  
Little Dealer - Little Prices - Little Knowledge !"
2,1,Little dealer fixed the awning its back home.we actually had a call from the dealer wanting to know how the service was.How funny I guess they don't look at yelp.have learned a hard lesson on this one.shame on you little dealer.
2,1,"I brought my 4 month old unit in for warranty work in January. Since then not once has the service department ever reached out to me unless I initiated the communication. Even then it's like pulling teeth to get a call back. No one knows what's going on. One call they tell me parts have been ordered and my unit should be ready in a few days and the next I'm told parts haven't been ordered and it will be a few more weeks. It has now been in the shop for 4 MONTHS! These were MINOR repairs folks! I'll never purchase or have any of my units serviced at this dealership again! They truly couldn't care less about the customer experience AFTER purchase. I'm not just disappointed, I'm disgusted at how I've been treated."
2,1,"The slowest customer service, parts and service you could possibly get. Can't follow through on parts owed (spare keys promised 3 months ago when I bought a brand new RV that they had lost the spare keys to) and takes 8 weeks to get minor things fixed under warranty."
2,5,"We didn't buy anything on this visit, but we'll be back. The service was quite friendly and everything was open to view. We had our dog with us and there was no problem wandering around. Great selection and good prices."
2,1,Don't really know about the sales department however the service department is nothing short of horrible. The main guy Jim provides the worst service I've ever seen. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.
2,1,"This is THE WORST COMPANY EVER!!!! I bought a brand new Momentum 5th wheel trailer and had warranty issues everytime I had taken it out to use it I had to bring it back into the shop for repairs. I understand that bugs need worked out of a new unit but thats not my issue. Its The service department taking almost 5 months to repair things that should have been done in 3 weeks!!! My 1 year warranty was almost up by the time I got my unit back and the entire camping season was missed. Everytime I called to get an update they never had one. They gave me the run around. Employees were constantly changing, nobody knew what they were doing. Biggest rip off company! We WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!! And tell anyone we know to never go there!"
2,1,"Do not waste your time or energy trying to get service from this dealer. Left my 2016 Momentum with them for one week for their ""evaluation"" which they guarantee will occur within 48 hours - if I hadn't called on the fourth day it would likely still be sitting there. No parts ordered, no repair work done, no callback, NO SERVICE."
2,2,"Since we did not purchase a camper here I can only account for the service department. With that being said, here is my part of the story.

We went camping and when we were leaving and closing up our pop-up the spring came out on one end and we couldn't reopen the pop up portion of the camper. 

We called and spoke with Kathy who said no problem, bring it down and they would take a look at it. She said they were backed up about 3 weeks, however she felt confident it would be looked at sooner. 

It was two days shy of 3 weeks when I called to inquire about the pop-up. I was then told on Thursday, that they would be looking at it on Saturday or Monday and I should hear something by Monday afternoon.

Friday morning, lol, I get a call from Kathy saying they were able to put the spring back in and it would only be the $60.00 diagnosis charge that we were originally quoted. 

My question is did she have it looked at because I called? How long would it have been if I hadn't called?

Maybe they need to hire some more people if they are having paying customers wait 3 weeks just to have it looked at?

If we need them we will be back, but we would prefer not to wait 3 weeks for a call only after I initiate the original request of has it been looked at."
2,2,"Little Dealer = Big Time Ticked Off!!

This is a long one....

We had been to Little Dealer last summer and had a bad experience.  But we figured it could have been because of the time of day we went, about 30 minutes to closing.  We walked in and were told to have a look around.  No salesperson escorted us.  Didn't think anything of it.  But when we were ready to leave (10 minutes to closing) we discovered that the door we needed to go back through was locked.  I had to jump the side fence, be let in the through the frontdoor (informing the guy at the door that J was still outside sweating his sack off and to let me the heck back in so I could open the showroom door for J), and go back through the showroom to let J inside.  After that, we decided to tent camp the remainder of the summer. 

Fast forward to this summer - After gettnig fed up with scouring Craigslist and dealing with people selling junk, I figured we'd give Little Dealer a shot.  

We swing on by Memorial Day and are greeted immediately.  We're escorted by the sales guy on the lot and find the trailer that we liked a lot.  After being informed that there's a 100% refundable deposit we can put down, J and I decided to pull the trigger.  I hand over my CC and the sales guy walks off.  He comes back and says that the machine is out of paper so he does not know if the transaction went through - though it said approved.  Because he was not sure the card went through, I was required to also leave a check for the deposit.  I was then informed that if the card did infact go through, that I would be refunded the amount to my card immediately.  We finish the financing paperwork and I'm told that someone would contact me in a few days. 

A few days later, I'm contacted and told due to the trailer's age (10 years old), their creditor will not approve the loan.  I could either do a cash purchase, or look at a newer trailer (for a longer term/cheaper payment).  

This past Saturday - We return to decide on what to do with the trailer.  Something told me to check my bank account before we left the house.  Sure as sh*t, the credit card purchase for the deposit went through on 05/30.   Not to mention the check I wrote was cleared on 05/31.  Was the deposit refunded back to my credit card - NO!  

Having this information in hand, I planned on using it as a bargaining chip in making a cash offer - we really liked the trailer after all. 

J's uncle goes with us to ask a few questions - He owns a trailer and knows how/what to maintaince.  The sales guy almost looked irritated at the fact that we had someone with us to ask questions on our behalf.  

Here's the used trailer scoop:

Looking up the specs on the NADA site, J informs the sales guy of the price gap: what NADA shows, and what they're selling it for - about $2k difference.  We're told that they do not use NADA to price their trailers.  Okay, what do they use then as a guide? Are they writing numbers down on pieces of paper and pulling it out of a hat?  How is the consumer to know they're paying a fair price?

These trailers are purchased and resold AS-IS.  They do not do any type of inspection when THEY purchase them or maintain them.  They wash them, and that's it!  BUT they mark up the price to obtain a profit - Basically for something they've only moved to its spot on the lot and thrown a bucket of water on.  

You have 3 options for the $598.00 inspection (which includes $50 to use to purchase supplies at their store):
1) Buy the trailer and fix it yourself (if there's issues)
2) Buy the trailer and have them fix it (if there's issues)
3) You can back out of the deal, BUT you're out $598.00

Shoot a home inspection is about that price and that's for a HUGE investment!

FYI...BY LAW - They have to check the gas lines, regardless if you purchase the inspection or not. 

After chewing on everything, I decide I want out and want my money back.  Inform the sales guy that I'm due back the 2 deposits, check and the credit card deposit.  He seemed surprised stating, ""Oh the card went though?"" He seemed slightly irritated with my change of heart and said that he has to fill out paperwork for the refund. But that LDLP isnt out to make enemies.  We're told that the credit card can be processed immediately.  And that it could be a week before I'm refunded. Then we're told that the credit charge does not show on their system, just the check.  Then I'll have to wait till coming week to get things straightened out with the Accounting Department.  We leave, with no money refunded and me exteremly ticked off.  

They get 2 stars instead of 1 due to Sheryl in the Accounting Department.  When I called, she said she was already working on my stuff and appolgized for what happened.  An hour later, she calls me stating that the refund to the card has been processed and that the check is ready for pick up (I didn't want it mailed). 

THANK YOU SHERYL for picking up a dropped ball."
2,1,"Bait and switch. Advertised a 6x10 cargo trailer for $1,821.00 on their website. Told me they are $2,100.00 and that was a mistake and could not sell it for that price. Take your business to a better, more honest company!!!"
2,1,"I have literally had my pop up trailer for about a month and a half since I bought it NEW in September of 2016.  Yes, that is right.... the service department has had it for nearly 6 of the eight months I have owned it.   

It is unbelievable they are still in business.  This brand new 2017 Forest River trailer had the follow issues:

1. Two flaws in separate sections of the canvas, leaking sink.  Took 3 months to get first replacement shipped and covered by warranty, only to have the incorrect part show up.  Ordered another which took another month to get.  
2. damaged exterior which they did manage to get replaced without issue.
3. Bed mattress that started to come apart after one use (only to be replaced by another damaged mattress).  After two months of waiting on the third mattress, found out it is not at the service shop yet and may not have even been ordered.  
4. A faulty CO sensor.  Apparently, this is a common issue they deal with all the time.  Yet, there is no recall on them.  A CO SENSOR.... seems this might be kind of important.
5. Failing battery.  When discussed with the service rep, she said she could submit it with the rest of the warranty claim for the CO Sensor but wasn't sure how much long the delay would be if they went that way.  Or, of course, I could buy a new one from them is what I was told.  

Keep in mind that in eight months I have had the chance to use the trailer twice.  

They have not been able to effectively tell me when I will get the trailer back each time.  I have had dozens of calls unreturned.  I have been hung up on... laughed at.  I have spoken to more than a handful of staff, including multiple managers who have said they were brought in 'to fix things'.  It takes multiple weeks just to assess the issue, then weeks to months to get parts (sometimes incorrect parts), then even longer to fix.  

Some staffers have tried to empathize with me and the situation which only becomes patronizing when the same issues persist.  Even more patronizing and irritating is when the Phone Hold Message states how they have one multiple awards for their service department.  Based on the info above, you can only image the irony.

I may get the trailer back today but likely without the third mattress and with an almost dead battery (I refuse to spend one more dime with them EVER to buy a new one).

Believe me when I say I will make sure everyone I know and others I may not know are aware of my troubles with this company and guide them to not buy from them.

UPDATE:  NO sooner did I finish writing this (about an hour ago) that I heard back from them and they received the wrong CO Sensor.  Back to the drawing board again!

Update.  7/23/17 - Apparently, Forest River doesn't test for AZ heat.  The service manager told me this after the diamond plating and corresponding weather stripping started to buckle.  This was weeks ago.  Anyhow, they did call me to let me know that the parts were in.  However, after I hooked up the trailer and drove yet again to the service dept, I got a call from the service manager telling me not all the parts are there. Of course, no one could tell me when the parts would get there. The parts manager did tell me on Monday that he couldn't get a hold of his manufacturer and thus wasn't sure when they were coming. When I called on Friday, I was informed the parts were there and they could begin.  And then, much to my surprise, I was asked when would I'd like to bring my trailer in.   They already had it. UN-F'N BELIEVABLE!  

Anyway, I now have my trailer back. All I have to wait for now is a replacement mattress. Of course, they can't tell me when it'll arrive. And, they tell me they have no control over the manufacturer because they're just a dealership. Again, unbelievable.  At least they've ordered one at this point. The original plan they proposed was to wait until another like trailer came in then they could swap out the mattresses in my trailer. My question is would they've just put the crappy old mattress in the brand-new trailer for somebody else to deal with?  Based on all of the experiences listed above, I will let anyone who cares to read this come to their own conclusion.  

AGAIN, my advice is to NEVER, EVER, EVER BUY A TRAILER OR RV FROM THIS COMPANY. EVER

One last thing, I told the service manager the least they could do is deliver the mattress to my house so I did not have to go out of my way, given all the trouble I've experienced.  He referenced the negative comments (Such as here and Facebook, I am presuming) as a likely reason they would not do that.  He then proceeded to tell me he is trying to help me and make things better and that we should not focus on the past.  I would have been happy to do that if anything had gotten better over the 10 MONTH ORDEAL I have been thru with this shitty company."
2,1,"Had 3 parts plastic welded on water holding tank for pop up trailer costing $280.  All 3 leaked!  Ran out of time and had to add silicone to stop them from leaking.  

While in service department they were openly ragging on another customer.  I wondered what they said about me when I left."
2,1,"I went online and searched their inventory for a small travel trailer. Online the MSRP was listed at 8750.00. I called and spoke with Gary about the model, when I told him the model number and the stock number he said that the price ranges from 14k to 17k. I got off the phone with Gary and went back to check the website, the website had the same information that I had originally told them. So I naturally thought Gary had made a mistake. I called back and spoke with a woman, she told me the price online is not the price and it would be closer to 17k. Ha! Amazing. It just got more expensive. This place is shady... I would stay away... It's good to know that the prices online are incorrect and are close to 10k more."
2,1,"My wife and I planned on trading in our 5th wheel so stopped by to look around. Knowing that work will be needed at some point I wanted to meet someone in service dept, I asked several questions of this young man that he could not answer except one. Late twenties early 30's ""I am the new service manager. Must be a relative. We will pass, no time to deal with trial and error. Hint LDLP hire experienced service people."
2,1,Don't. Just don't. They will oversell the same item more than once in order to ensure a sale and waste your time. Typical shady sales tactics.
2,1,"I inquired about an RV in the Prescott lot and was told it could be brought down to Phoenix where I live with a $500 refundable deposit. This seemed reasonable enough so I provided the founder ""Joy"" with a credit card number from my Visa debit card. She assured me in no uncertain terms after consulting with internal sources that money would not be deducted from my checking account. This was on a Friday. Within the hour I reviewed my checking account balance and saw a $500 deduction to Little Dealer Little Prices. I contacted her immediately with the problem and she said a reversal would be done (today is Sunday and I am still out $500 dollars and have had to delay paying some critical bills). To make matters worse she wanted another $500 in security money to bring the unit to Phoenix and refused to do so unless I would cough up the money (YES SHOCKING!!!). She did not provide any documentation the reversal has been done. I am appalled at her lack of a sense of urgency regarding this and concern for my situation. In addition,  it is inconceivable that someone of her stature within the company would not know this would have happened and is asking me for $500 more. Should have read reviews first. They tell the story of how BAD this business really is. Unbelievable. STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS!!!"
2,5,"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews and feel compelled to tell our blissful story with this dealer: 

We brought our 2001 travel trailer in for a major service that included a significant amount of fiberglass repair (roof, front panel etc). 

We had previously gone to several other reputable shops in the valley and had gotten quoted absolute fortunes to fix it (sometimes more than what we paid fo rthe trailer!), so we thought, cant hurt to have yet another opinion. 

We expanded the scope of the repair in the process to include for instance, diamond plating the entire trailer's front panel. AND YET! LDLP came up with both the most satisfying technical repair option AND the lowest price. 
Once repair started to happen, their tech called me to make sure that the work was going to be done to our exact specification and they did the work within the agreed upon timeline (even if it took several calls to Kathy, to make sure it happened) but the end result amazed me, still today: 
Not only did the LDLP technician fix all that was on the work order but he decided to go around the trailer and take care of small things that needed attention we DID NOT EVEN ASK THEM TO: AT NO COST!  the trailer was also cleaned up inside.  You can tel that the tech took pride in handing out a good, clean product and he took 15 minutes to walk me through all that was done and how.

Mind you we still spent quite a bit of money for the fiberglass repair but it was very nice to know that we would not be needing additional $$ to fix the little things. 
We used the trailer on a long trip shortly after and it worked great. 

We will definitely be back to LDLP Mesa for the quality and value of their service Dept. and will consider them when upgrading our 2001 unit. 
That is well deserved."
2,1,So we got our rv back from the awning repair went down East and had lights shorted out.surprise surprise.called again was told sure bring it in but we won't get to it for 6-8 weeks .really busy. But you know you can take it wherever you want.guess what we are and I am also talking with attorney and BBB and 3 on your side.I will not be treated like this.And take it sitting down.stay far far away from this rip off of a company. They are only interested in taking your money.there is no customer service here.owner does not return calls.STAY Away......so sorry I ever walked into the place.
2,5,"We were looking to downsize from our 5th wheel to a smaller camper. We'd been looking for several weeks, intentionally avoiding LDLP due to some previous issues with their service department. After walking out of several dealers where we couldn't get the deal done, we found a unit we liked on LDLP.com and cautiously went to visit.

Much to our surprise, we had a really great experience. We ended up buying a brand new trailer, something I swore I'd never do, but everything fell into place. Even when I said we wanted to take it home that day Joy was able to call service and get the prep work expedited. They had it ready to go early afternoon and there was no funny business with the paperwork. 

However, we encountered a manufacturer defect with the brakes on pulling out of the lot. We were planning on leaving for a 2 week vacation that day (yes, crazy) and Gary and Scott stayed until after 8pm rebuilding the brakes for a temporary fix to get us out the door. It was amazing.

Wf did discover several issues the first couple of days like hot water tank still being on bypass, hot and cold faucets flipped, and outdoor faucet not working. I'm giving them benefit of the doubt in that we only gave them about 2 hours to check and prep the unit, but would be nice if their check process was a little more thorough. 

At the end of our trip we dropped it back off to get some minor warranty issues fixed (and have the brake fix made permanent). A week later and they are finished the punch list and had it ready for pick-up. I know I go against the rest of the reviews, but we were very pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. No buyers remorse to speak of."
2,1,"They're a bunch of crooks. Stay away. I bought a camper, was told by the sales lies about it's capability. They then would not correct the error. I ended up losing 8 k selling that camper. I've since purchased 4 new campers for my side biz. They lost out on potential sales and repairs as I used to stop there and have my campers repaired there. Stay clear. So many other honest trades out there in mesa, no need to go to LDLP."
2,1,"We were there to look at trailers had 1 sales ""ranger"" approach us & said she was an rv associate but walked with us for approximately 5 mins. There were no gulf carts to take us out so she pointed were to go. No one else even approached us! We have cash! We also both have an 800 credit score...needless to say we're going to main to check out other  rv delears"
2,5,"Have yet to take delivery on my new camper, but so far so good. Joy was very personable and took the time to fully inform us without issue as this is our first camper (even on a Sunday!). Our salesman was Wayne, and there are no complaints for him either. He did tend to favor selling a new unit vs a lower priced used unit, but after speaking with Carrie in Finance I know understand the ease of financing a new vs used. Place was clean and really nice, and everyone we have dealt with thus far have given us much reason to come back for future purchases. I will update this review after taking delivery of the camper.

--update--

Picked up the camper with no issue. Everyone out in the service and parts department were great. Ran into a few snags with wiring up the 7 pin on my truck, but took full ownership of the problem and made it work even though the Service Manager and two employees had to stay almost 2 hours over to get it done. I will always recommend this dealership, and will always do my business with them in the future. If you are looking for an RV and a company that treats you like family, this is your place!

--update 2--

So the pilot went out on my wiring harness and all of my trailer lights stopped working (three days before our big road trip). I called up Roger in the service department and he got me right in. Lance quickly found the issue and fix it within half an hour. Just as courteous this time as others, this dealer continues to keep us happy. I am glad I made my way out to them rather than visiting another dealer that is closer to me, the service is well worth the drive."
2,1,"Being newly in the market for my first RV/motorhome I admit I've got a lot to learn. One thing I learned in the past two days is to read the Yelp reviews from people who are experienced RV owners BEFORE going out to shop the dealers.  Yesterday we drove across town to a place that claimed to have a large inventory and they had ONE unit on their lot, that's right ... ONE!

Today I ""thought"" I had heard something good about Little Dealer Little Prices so again we drove clear across town to shop for a Class C.  When we got there we saw a parking lot in back with some RV's in it but no way to get to them, only a small car parking lot in front of what appears to be a restaurant or retail store or something.  No salesmen around, no signs, no indication at all how to get to the RV's they supposedly have for sale, just a foreboding tall wrought iron fence.  We drove around looking for another entrance, but no, none to be found.

When we returned to the little car parking lot we saw someone drive into an opening where there was a locked motorized gate but when we got to it the sign said it was for service customers with appointments ONLY.  Still not an employee or salesperson in sight.

Having no way to see (or buy) one of their products we had no choice but to leave and go elsewhere. That's why it's always important to read reviews first and when they are consistently as bad as this place has, believe them and don't waste your time."
2,1,"I should have believed all the bad reviews.  Came at 5:15pm and asked if they were open and if I could look around. They said yes and that they didn't close until 6.  They seemed welcoming. However every camper was locked.  Nobody was willing to help. There were 6 people lounging around doing nothing.   Guess they don't want to sell anything.  I'm leaving and going back to another dealer to buy tonight.

Ironically they have a sign posted that says to let them know if a salesperson was friendly and did a good job and they will give them a $5 bonus.  Based on my experience I suppose it never has to be paid out."
2,2,"The sales lady, Carole was truly a delightful person. She is not pushy and tried to help when we expressed specific concerns about the model we were looking at. Two stars is because in the end, we were not able to make a deal. :("
2,5,"Super friendly and knowledgeable staff who are make you feel comfortable, not sharked. Such a cool little office with a camping theme and their inside showroom is so awesome! Looks like a camping area set up at night. I highly recommend this place."
2,1,"BEWARE...I would stay as far away from this company as possible!!  My brand new 5th-wheel trailer has spent approximately 40% of it's time over the past 20 months sitting in their repair lot.  AND, they're either incompetent or fraudulent, as they have charged me for services that were never even attempted to be repaired."
2,1,"I took my pop up here to have the lift system repaired.  
1. Had to call them every few days to see what was happening.  They did not call me nor did they do what they said they would (with respect to making progress with the estimate).  It took two weeks of pestering just to get an estimate.
2.  Estimate was $1000.  I was amazed.   They said the entire system needed to be replaced.  I was not willing to spend this much without some research.
3.  They would not provide me with part numbers for the required parts and lied about there being no part numbers (I found the numbers later).  I paid them $100 diagnostic charge for an inaccurate diagnosis, and refusal to provide data (part numbers).
4.  I found the required parts for $350 and put them in myself.  It did not require replacement of the entire system, and the task was rather simple.
My experience with little dealer has convinced me they are slow, dishonest, deceitful, incompetent, overpriced.  If you like these qualities, this is the place for you."
2,2,Drove out here to look at the rock wood roo and worked with Jesse. Wasn't knowledgeable and couldn't answer any of the questions we had. We wanted to build one and have ordered and he hands us the paper and did not go over at all. We felt this dealership could care less if we wanted to purchase or not. The only thing good was the girl up front opened the door. We have also visited the deer valley location which wasn't any better with customer service. Please see review for that dealership.
2,3,"We recently purchased a Grand Design 354 RV.  The quality and floor plan of this toy hauler is just what we wanted! Of particular note is Hans who briefed us on the trailer's total workings including a complete informative walk through before driving it off the lot.  He will make it a pleasure to return for future service appointments. Shawn, our sales rep, was very helpful and accommodating in the beginning. After that, the negotiations were arduous, confusing and it was challenging getting to the final price as clarity was not their strong point.  After working with Hans, we left as happy campers."
2,4,"Since I left with my new RV, Ronnie Dye (the best salesman I ever dealt with) kept in touch to see how all was going.  He knew of our situation and kept up on it. 

He gave me a number for a mobile service that Little Dealers deals with and scheduled a repair.  The gentleman came out and repaired our RV.  I sent him a copy of the repair order and within 24 hours I had a check reimbursement from Little Dealers for the exact amount. 

I am extremely satisfied with my choice and with this dealership. Ronnie could have been just a salesman that ended it there, but he is a true professional. He went the extra miles for us and I know he will do it for you. The enthusiasm, knowledge, and pride in his work were definitely shown from the first moment. His dedication and customer service were shown these last few days.  I know he did a lot of the leg work, but Little Dealers stepped up and fixed a mistake. Which shown me that this is a good dealership that stands behind their word. 

I am truly impressed with the follow up service and dedication shown. Thank you!!!"
2,1,"I would like to preface this by saying this is a review of the service department, not the sales department.  I say this because I bought my pop up with them about 4 years ago, and have been very happy with it, and I got it for a reasonable price, after quite a bit of haggling (I bought a used trailer, and got it for about $5K cheaper than what they wanted for it).  For sales, they have a decent selection, so I'm not going to rule them out in the future, assuming I can get the right trailer for the right price.

That being said, I am never bringing my trailer back to this service department again.  On my last camping trip, the valve on the cassette of my cassette toilet (a thetford) broke.  So, after I get back, I call Little Dealer because they have Saturday hours and I knew they were familiar with my cassette.  After calling and telling them what the problem was, and that I only needed to bring in the cassette and that it would be obvious what the problem was, they insisted that I needed to bring in the entire trailer so they could make sure that it alighted properly.  I told them that was pointless, but, they wanted to be ""thorough"", so I relented, and hurried, got my trailer hooked up, and needlessly drove it across town and dropped it off so they could get started working on it.  They gave me a estimate for 2 weeks, and that seemed reasonable for the RV industry, even though it was something that would take anyone only 5 minutes to diagnose, and repair and replace with the new part.

Two weeks go by, and without getting a call from when they said that they were going to call me, I call them, and after being on hold with them for over 30 minutes, they respond that they hadn't yet even ordered the part, but they could get it there soon, but it would take a couple of days.  I was quoted that it was going to cost about $220 for the part, and about $60 for the diagnose and repair, and I would be able to get it on the following Tuesday afternoon.  Not having much choice, I complied.  Also, even before calling Little Dealer, I checked prices just for a whole new cassette, and they had been previously available, through e-bay, for $140 which included the new part, the new valve, even a whole new cassette..  Unfortunately, they weren't available any more, and Thetford only sold their parts to dealers, not the direct customers.

My true anger started when I went to pick up my trailer.  I called ahead that morning, of course being on hold for another 20 minutes, and told them I would be picking it up before they close at 5:00.  So, at 4:30, I get there, and discover that they not only charge $60 for labor for the diagnostic, but also another $60 for the replacement and repair.  I know for a fact that this entire thing would have taken a total of no more than 5 minutes, if I would've moved really slowly.  So, seeing that I paid $120 for labor for 5 minutes of work, I asked who exactly is working there that was getting paid $1,440 per hour.  They seemed dumbfounded, but I  paid up, something like $360 for something that would have costed me only $140 and 5 minutes of work, if I could have found the part.

What really made me upset, though, is that they knew I was coming, but they hadn't pulled my trailer yet.  It was parked 4 levels deep in their lot that had 32 other pop-up trailers in there for repair, so it took another 20 minutes to get the trailer out.  If they knew I was coming, shouldn't they have already pulled it out?"
2,1,"we purchased a new camper from Little Dealer Little Prices of Mesa; within 12 hours we realized several defective components of the unit. Due to our travel plans, they patched some items and assured us the rest would be remedied upon our return. When we returned from our trip, we returned the camper and it has been in their service department for the past 3+ months. The laundry list of items related to our defective camper include, but may not be limited to, a cracked counter top, damaged window seals, leaking roof, AC and fridge not working, missing running light covers, damaged propane gas lines, damaged main electrical wires due to improper fastening, misaligned side walls - causing scratched paint, and roof fan latch broke. We have attempted to communicate our concerns with the manager/owner, David Sampson, While he was initially responsive, he has failed to offer a solution to our defective unit and has gone silent on options for us. In fact, his service department continues to tell us to be ""patient."" At this point, we have been sufficiently patient, considering the unit has been defective since purchase. The service department reports 5+ weeks to order parts and then 3+ weeks backlog for repairs. Even with an 8-week timeframe - our unit has been with Little Dealers for 3+ months and defective for the entire time we have owned the unit. We have had communications with the manufacturer whom has informed us that Little Dealers is responsible to refund our unit and that Little Dealers is responsible to work with the manufacturer directly. While we have been continuing to try to communicate with Little Dealers, they have since become unresponsive - in spite of the fact that they continue to have our camper in their service department, along with several thousand dollars of our personal possessions still in the unit."
2,1,Walked in at 1:37 this afternoon.  Receptionist was very nice and went and told a female salesperson I was here.  I asked if I could look at the trailers on the lot.  She told me of course and that the salesperson would join me on the lot.  At 2:22 I walked back in and the salesperson was still in her office texting on the cell phone.  Not another customer in the lobby and definitely not any other customers on the lot in 94 degree heat.  Very disappointed
2,1,Have not been back since they scammed my family a couple years ago. I have since purchased 6 campers for my side business. Grateful that these guys scammed me out of my money only once. I have now spent close to 90k on campers for my rental biz and I am grateful I learned of their ways before I spent any more money there. Lots of great companies in mesa I have dealt with on the campers I own. Do your research and go elsewhere for sales and service.  LDLP is a horribly run company. BBB is useless in addressing the business practices and attorneys are too expensive to hire to sue these crooks.
2,5,"Great service, friendly, accommodating, efficient, doing now what others could do in a month.
Jason and Allie took ownership of our problem and worked toward successful repair. Laura worked with our extended Warantee company to make our repair seamless from an insurance perspective.
All in all a satisfying experience.
Would recommend an would return in future."
2,2,"Full disclosure, I received a call fro Roger the service manager. we spoke at some length and he has since refunded my 200 and some odd dollars brake repair charge and also gave use 90ish additional for our 'trouble"". He was concerned about our experience and assured me this was not the norm. I will consider giving them the benefit of the doubt and also will post any future experiences."
2,3,"OK, I took it back as I had a issue with my lift.  They did look at it fairly timely, took it in on Monday morning and had it diagnosed by Wed.  No issues other than price, which I guess is what it is, but seems high considering I can find the part for around 200.00 but they wanted 550.00 labor included, but freight and tax not included, plus the 60.00 to diagnose is almost a third of what I paid for the whole trailer.  Maybe its just me.  Guess I will learn how to fix this stuff on my own."
2,1,"This is the first time I have ever posted a negative review on a business.  I think the sales staff at Country Club location use dishonest business practices.  My salesman was Shawn and Sales Manager was Kevin.  Little Dealer Little Prices has been our RV store for 3 generations.  They chose to make this sales experience the worst one I ever had.  The sales team couldn't even turn the water pump on in a Heartland Cyclone.  I literally went down 6 times to inspect my Heartland Cyclone and we shook hands and set up a delivery time.  Upon me showing up they had different plans on my trade in price and then didn't have my toy hauler ready.  They could careless about their word.  Beware of Kevin the Sales Manager Kevin he is dishonest and lies to achieve his desired goal.  Our family has used them for 5 units.  Never again will I waste my time with a sales staff that does not have integrity or care that you are happy.  A very disappointed long time consumer.  Go to another dealership!  My entire family is done with Little Dealer Little Prices!

Update:  2 and a half years later.  Thinking about updating my trailer.  This experience is still fresh on my mind.  I remember sitting in the parking lot looking a Yelp posts.  They were negative for the most part.  I said I would give them a shot anyway.  My family had along history of using them.  I thought they would take care of me.  I have lots of friends and family that are fortunate to be able to enjoy camping.  This is for all of you.  Avoid this dealership for parts, service, and especially sales.  I think they breed dishonesty at their core, integrity is a foreign concept, and they will do everything they can to screw you over.

Read other posts as well.  I am not an isolated experience.  Yield the warning of hundreds and go to one of the other 50 RV dealers in the valley."
2,1,"If you are considering buying a part for your rv here...dont. We purchased a new toilet, but we're a little unsure about the size. First of all it was stocked in the wrong place on the shelf and the sign read ""$158.00"", but when we got to the register we were told it was actually 250.00. We explained that we were concerned over the dimensions and asked in detail about their return policy. We were assured that it was no problem "" as long as it wasn't used, ha ha ha!!"". Well, it didn't fit and we were able to return it, minus a 35.00 restocking fee! We explained to Mike the Parts Manager that we were not told this despite us asking point blank. Mike supplied "" it's posted down by your knees""...yes...knees. I guess we live and learn where to spend our hard money, but we sure were disappointed by our experience and will not be back. We were long time customers and fans of this place, but we recommend you go elsewhere."
2,1,"OMG STAY AWAY!!! When our deal fell through it took months of calls and threats to get our deposit back. They are super pushy, aggressive and none of them seem happy to be there. There are sooooo many more options in Arizona. PLEASE DON'T GO!!!"
2,2,Bought brand new rv 11/28/15 had a few minor fixes.was told to bring in on 1/9/16.so we dropped off as requested two weeks go by no phone call as promised.so we called spoke with Melissa R.Yes rv ready great we will be in on  1/23 to pick up.while waiting one of the problems with the thermostat was told all directions in Manuel that was given when we purchased RV.we did not receive that part of paperwork.Gary said we would need to go on line and print out.31 pages.gal at service counter very UN cust friendlly finally printed out after some discussion.Rude behavior was running wield around that pllace. so we get our rv and most all was fixed except the the main problem DECAL still was not done.They had this RV two weeks!!!!Why???? So Melissa R states she is very sorry for this mishap and she will locate the decal herself.we again would here within the week from her.Ha Ha .so we are getting the rv ready for a trip my husband notices the awning is falling off of this thing.2/6 calls little dealer speaks to Melissa R again still no decal now we are told manufacturer had to order who knows when that will occur.so now we have the Rv back there again for the awning my husband was told to speak to the owner.alot of buck shuffling going on here.So as soon as I can calmly do this I will call the owner.stay tuned.

2,1,"I am not surprised of the 2 star rating after talking to the service manager.  I am being charged $55 for a diagnostic fee for warranty items not covered by Jayco on a bumper to bumper warranty.  $55 fee for them to open a cabinet door to see the plastic shelf lining is ripping!  Completely ridiculous!  When 1st arrived, the warranty service advisor who I had an appointment with was not available so someone else filled in. That person NEVER informed me that I would be charged a diagnostic fee if warranty didnt cover it.  Instead he told me to submit everything that was wrong to see if it would be covered but failed to tell me I would be charged.  I explained this to the manager but to no avail landed on deaf ears.  Will definitely not be a returning customer and will advise my camping community to do so as well.  Do yourself a favor and stay away if you want to avoid ridiculous service fee charges and horrible customer service."
2,4,"I would actually like to have more than one review of this dealership because different parts of the experience have been vastly different, but Yelp won't let me do that.  So.....I would have given a huge 5 STAR review for Hans, who did our new RV orientation with my husband and I last weekend.  We are total newbies to the RV camping world and he was so thorough, patient, and answered all of our (stupid) questions. He also gave us a lot of really useful tips & tricks.  He was so nice and I highly recommend requesting him for your orientation if you buy from them.

I originally rated this dealer 1 star due to this:  After we got home with our Grand Design RV, we realized that the dining table and chairs in our unit are not the ones that are intended for it.  When we originally looked at it, they were missing and the salesperson assured us they would get them.  They apparently took one out of another model and it is too large, and the wood doesn't match anything else in the unit. We literally called the next day and were told that we 'should have said something before we drove off the lot'.  We felt we were getting the run around and were upset.   After I posted my original review, and contacted Grand Design Customer Service, Little Dealer contacted us and the correct table/chairs were ordered.  It took a while, which was fine, but they did make it right in the end!"
2,1,They need a zero star. i wouldn't bring anything in there for service. Terrible customer service. if you want it done go somewhere else unless you need them to store your rv for you for a few months. ya can never get a call back and you have to call the manufacturer for them for parts and to authorize service.
2,1,"So this place was good at putting up a front on service and quality... I refuse to ever refer this place to anyone because they lie. I went to get a camper shell, with a rack which turned out to be the best part. First of all the protopp they had made, was a half in to an inch shorter on the passenger side which made the  back door not shut and the rubber piece started to fly off asap. Secondly the folding back window fell on my head while I was sleeping in it because the hole was made to big and the window won't latch. Last but not least they said an hour and a half and it took 2-3 hours and they didn't even make up for the short side... wow what a joke I think part of it is because they didn't like the fact that I showed up on time for my appointment and had to wait an hour at least to even get started..."
2,1,"Very poor service experience

I took my popup in for a 99.00 wheel bearing re-pack and brake inspection. The trailer was new to me and while the previous owner had taken good acre of it, I need to know for myself we were road ready for the summer. I am not going to specify people in this review.  

While I first called in, the service dept. was friendly and helpful. I dropped off my trailer and asked to have the work completed within 2 weeks. I got a call a week later telling me they replaced a bearing and I needed new tires and a wire needed to be fixed, but the breaks were good other than the wire.  i gave them the go ahead to replace the bearing, fix the wire and replace the 2 tires. I was quotes around 210.00ish which included the 99.00 form the repak and inspection.

This was new to me so i asked that a service person come out and help me understand where to have my break controller set to work properly. the very happy to do this and their tech came out.  He tried to engage the breaks via the controller, but had no success. It was obvious they would nee t keep the trailer to investigate what was going on.  I too was concerned as I was told that the breaks were working ""fine"" with their inspection.

2 days later I get a quote to fix the breaks that needed new magnets as well as the drums to be re-surfaced. I asked how this could be as they had been inspected and ""cleared"" just 2 days prior.  they blamed it on a new tech that was services my vehicle.  All I could think was,""I was going to take this up in the mountains in a week and by the grace of God, had asked to see how to adjust my break controller. the quote was for an additional 260.00 to fix all that was wrong.  I stated my issue with the fact that had I not asked for the demo on my break controller, I would be driving this with the expectation all was well.  They did reduce the bil to a little over 200.00 dollars, and also wanted me to know they had under billed me on the first service by 100.00.  I told them I agreed to the amount I was verbally given over the phone, but sorry for their error.

I thought that was bad enough, but I had been in contact with the previous owner who had service done at this location as well.  He told me he had the exact same service and a receipt to show for it just last March 2011 and had not used the vehicle once the work was done.  At that time the did not see a need to replace the bearing and he also was told that the breaks were in good condition. he specifically asked about the breaks as he knew he would be selling the trailer. So 2 times the breaks that were not working properly had been signed off on as ""working properly"".

I will never trust this location/company to work on my vehicle again."

Chris was very professional and fun at the same time.  The entire process was lengthy and it was hot out,   thankfully his humor and patience made it fly by.  

Thanks for the great job Chris...

2,1,"is a letter sent to the manufacturer today:  We bought our pop up camper new in May of 2016, from a dealer in  AZ.  we bought it at the end of the day on Memorial day weekend and everyone was in a hurry to close up for the holiday weekend.  Being extremely hot in AZ we didn't pop it up again for a few months.   we traveled to MI and popped it up there.  The first thing we noticed was the zippers on the left side back and right side front were at least 4 inches from zipping.  the canvas was out of the track the entire length over the back bed and on the right wall.  The fold up table was bent. One of the step bolts was missing.  The door would not fit in the frame and when we finally managed to get it in the door was crooked and wouldn't close correctly.  The fridge doesn't work on 120V unless 12 V is also turned on.  None of the doors would stay closed resulting in scratches to the wood.  Front bed stuck to the point of flattening the nubs for the support poles...... and there were other minor things I can't remember.  When we went back to AZ (staying in motels the whole way) we took it back to the dealer, who had it for 2 months trying to figure out what was wrong with it.  The dealer contacted the manufacturer and found out there was an adjuster for the canvas. They fixed, or tried to fix most of the issues.  We didn't use it again until recently.  The canvas still isn't right and its wearing holes where its rubbing,  The other bed is now sticking, the fridge still doesn't work right and now it blowing tires and we're being told it may have an axel issue!!! This camper came from the manufacturer like this.  We paid and are still paying for this thing.   It needs to be fixed CORRECTLY!! Or REPLACED.  Please contact me with where I can bring it, or forward this email to the people who can. I am currently in MI not far from IN.
LDLP is useless.  They fix at things, I don't think their service staff knows what their doing.  They don't return calls and when you finally get ahold of someone they make you feel like a problem.  I have grown to dispise this camper and LDLP, thus the letter to Viking Forrest River."
2,5,"We had a great experience here, We went by a couple times window shopping and delt with Linda who showed us around a few toy hauler trailers and then we decided to pull the trigger. Within a couple days they had the paperwork done and we picked up our new trailer today. The service guys did a great job of prepping the trailer and setting up the hitch and sway control devices and showing us how to properly operate all the cool features. I would definitely recommend them."
2,3,"Went here on 2 different occasion to look at campers. The first time I told the lady we were just looking around. We finished looking around with her and went into an office. I thought I was going to exchange information with her. She whipped out a credit app and wanted all of my information. It was a very bazaar situation. The lady kind of gave me the creeps. 
The second time was a few months later. A young girl helped us. She loaded us into a golf cart and drove it as fast as it would go. Making sharp turns every chance she had. F-that.
Again, a very strange transaction.

We left and and went down the road and bought one someplace else."
2,1,"We took our 1999 Chevy Silverado in to Little Dealer Little Prices in Mesa because our camper shell was leaking between the shell and the cab of the truck. On a summer trip to the east much of the contents got wet due to this leak. They told me the problem was actually not between the shell and the cab but was due to the driver's side window of the camper that needed to be replaced. The first problem was they were going to check on ordering this window and call me back, but I never received a call back.  I finally called them and they had not done one thing about trying to order this. So, start over. They did get the window in, I took it back and they replaced the window. Big problem, it still leaked.  I could have kept at it with them, but we were very frustrated with them because we had already wasted so much time and some money trying to get it fixed. So, I decided to try somewhere else, Arizona RV Supercenter at 256 E. Main St in Mesa 480-649-4466. They usually do bigger jobs so I was surprised they even took on our pidley job...best of all it's fixed, and for only $100 (less than Little Dealer) and Arizona RV Supercenter completely fixed the problem.  Friends have used the Little Dealer in Phoenix and had a better experience, so maybe it's just the Mesa facility that has problems. Not happy at all with Little Dealer in Mesa."
2,5,"We searched for about a year before we upgraded from our 21' pull along trailer to a bigger 5th Wheel.  We went to the RV Shows and looked at local dealers.   We finally decided on a Grand Design Solitude and went to Little Dealer Little Prices in Mesa to look at the model we had decided on.  We had the great good luck to work with Ronnie Dye as our salesman.  Ronnie is phenomenal:   knowledgeable, personable and zero pressure.   He has kept in touch with us to insure our complete satisfaction as we had a few warranty items needing attention after we bought the Solitude.  We have been so happy with every contact at Little Dealer, from the Service Department to the folks who prepped our new RV, from Ronnie to the Finance person and everyone in between.    We absolutely love our Solitude and  highly recommend Little Dealer Little Prices.   If you go to the one in Mesa, ask for Ronnie Dye, he's great to work with!"
2,1,"Had to wait for my warranty time to pass before posting since I was stuck going to them for all warranty work. Now that is over.

Sales experience: It went reasonably well. I had my own financing which made it easier. However we were a bit taken back by how the finance manager handled the closing. We wrote a check for the down payment. When we handed it to him he looked at it suspiciously and followed with, ""please have a seat in the lobby while I see if the check is any good"". Then when the check was proven valid, he yelled out from his office to the lobby, ""You're good to go!"" Are you kidding me? Absolutely classless.

Delivery and Service:
Went for final walk through on day of pick up. Salesman was nowhere to be found and they had done little to no prep on the vehicle for delivery. Waited 45 minutes after arriving at the time they chose. Finally we get to the coach and start pointing everything out that was not working. We felt the walk through was rushed. Further, the tech that did the walk thru could not answer basic questions about how things worked. Had to leave the RV with them due to the lack of prep for delivery. Really ruined what should have been a great happy day. Left and called the salesman about our terrible experience when supposedly picking up our RV. He seemed concerned until he didn't follow up or call back. Called again. Same thing, he seemed concerned again, and again never called back. Sales and Service seem like 2 different companies with little communication between the two. Never heard from him again until he called and wanted me to do a satisfaction survey. Wow.

Finally got things worked out and picked up the RV.  However, we were not able to get answers to questions about specifics. The tech actually stated at one time that there are too many brands for him to know specifics about each one. Also, the exterior of the coach was dirty on final delivery. It looked like they sprayed water on it and then swirled the dirt around with a squeegee.

Since, the coach has been in 4 times for warranty work. The first time it was in I got calls providing status and it was a decent experience. Since then, not so much. The following times we would get a message saying it is not ready yet and call us back for an update. When I would call them back, always within an hour, gave them my name and let them know they called and asked me to call back, they put the person on the phone that called me and each time they asked what I wanted. (??????????). I would remind them that they called me and my RV was there in service and they left a message for me to call. 3 times, they said they would have to go find out status and call me back. 3 times, they never called back. Then I call them back the next day and remind them that they never called me back as stated, they seem not to care. RV has never been done on the day they say it will be done.

Clean up after repair or work is done is non existent. Each time we get it back, we find wire clippings and sawdust. And on one occasion they even left black finger prints. 

The service personnel are also a bit out of sorts. Not everytime, but on 2 occasions when approaching the service desk, I was met with blank stares and no greeting. Twice when the lady behind the desk did finally speak after I just stood there, she actually said, ""Did you need something?"" 

Bottom line, I feel that all experiences with this company could have been very positive if the workers there showed a bit more concern, class, and do what they said they would do. From reading the other reviews it appears there are some issues here.

Hoping Little Dealer takes these comments seriously and understands how they look from a customer perspective. I wish them luck and hope they don't brush this off. 

Also, please keep in mind, while it maybe just a unit to you guys, it is a major life investment/event for us, the customer that buy these expensive items."
2,3,"After I posted my review about our 07 Jayco Featherlite our saleswoman Carol called us to ask us how the trailer is performing, I explained to her about the right directional and the awning, she stated that she read our review and they have to try to improve that. I agreed, we took our trailer in on Saturday and little dealers Little Prices performed all the necessary repairs so I added a star to their review, unfortunately the hassle we had with putting money down and financing,  this is the best I will give you, three stars. Thank you Carol for following up and making things the best  possible."
2,1,"Had to call them for a part I needed. Talked to a person that said he was the new parts person. He took all my information for the part I needed. Called me an hour later to clarify the part. Said he would let me know as soon as he ordered it, later that day or the next morning. Never heard from him again. This was a month ago. Nothing has changed here."
2,4,"Went to buy a topper for a truck after calling and getting a price over the phone (Mesa location). The original salesperson wasn't there and the other salesman said the first salesman quoted the wrong price and it would be $100 more.  Hmmm.  We went and looked at the first salesman's log book, and sure enough there it was, my conversation and price quote.  So the second salesman said, I'm confused, I can't take your deposit to order this, come back another time and see salesman no. 1.

Update:

Ok, both the owner and the original salesman reached out very quickly, so that raises my opinion of the dealer.  The original salesman honored the price he quoted me the first time, so I went ahead and bought the topper.  It's on order and I'll let you know how it ends up..."
2,1,"Do NOT do business with these people EVER!  We bought our tent trailer from these guys, and have had nothing but trouble.  We took it in for 2 new batteries, and from there, went to a family reunion in NM.  Nothing in our trailer worked.  the heater, the fridge, water pump, nothing.  We dropped it off at LDLP on the way home.  They claim that someone reversed the polarity was on the batteries which fried the whole motherboard!  Hello!  They did the installation and no one had touched it since!  $900 later, assuming that everything works now like they said, we park the trailer for the winter.  Next camping trip, we have new batteries, and go to crank it up, and it won't go up.  Back to Little Dealer.  They say a cable is broken.  Once again, They were the last ones to use the crank!  $500.  They also told us that the element is going out on the refrigerator. Estimate: $300.  Being pretty much done with them, I bought the part from another dealer for $49 and was going to install it myself.  So, today I take off the vent covers to look at the back of the refrigerator, and what do I find?  They had unplugged the fridge!  I plugged it in and ran an extension cord to the trailer, turned the fridge to electric and left for 4 hours.  Came back and the fridge was cold!  Seriously?  If I didn't have other things to do with my time, I would sue the pants off these guys.  This is the MOST dishonest dealership I've ever seen, and I have worked for car dealerships for the last 15 years, so I would know.
BTW, Jason was our service advisor who NEVER kept us up to date on what was going on, Jim was our technician that told us that the refrigerator element was bad.  I finally called the service manager and haggled about the money since it was pretty apparent that they were breaking things on my trailer so that I could pay them to fix it.  He agreed to split the cost with me, which I still was not happy with, but felt like I had no other choice at that point.  Shame on you LDLP.  We will NOT be back!"
2.5,4,"We have only had the experience of looking at the RV but not buying one yet. We don't have anywhere to store it at this time. 
Keith has helped us 2 times with showing us 40 foot diesel motor homes. We look forward to buying from these guys in the future.
I gave 4 stars since we don't have the experience of buying from them yet."
2.5,5,"At the risk of sounding over the top, this may very well be the best experience we have ever had with a vehicle dealer of any type. I normally hate dealers and dealerships...car dealers, rv dealers, doesn't matter. I honestly can't stand knowing that there's a formula being used against me to get the most money out of me. I've had countless bad experiences and maybe a couple decent experiences, but Power RV actually left us feeling incredible about our purchase even 2 weeks later.

We actually found Power RV by driving by their repair yard on Main St. We thought it was a sales lot and saw a camper like the one we already owned and stopped by to see what it was going for. Turns out it was in for repair and in really bad shape, but the mechanic on duty (very pleasant guy) pointed us to the main sales lot.

We had to head that way anyway but honestly debated the whole time whether to stop...we really weren't looking for a new camper, we just liked browsing. Since it was on our way we went ahead and stopped by as they were just opening. When we pulled in, they quickly apologized that all of their sales people had called in sick so it was just the owner and a manager but offered to answer any questions we had as they unlocked the campers for us. We were totally fine with that, especially since both of them were so personable. We browsed a bit and got to talking and casually mentioned the ideal camper we'd been looking for for several years (but could never afford or find). The owner stopped and said, ""you know, you're not going to believe this but I'm supposed to be picking up a 5th wheel just like that today"" and mentioned an approximate price that was right in our range. Yeah, right! Figuring it was just a sales tactic we asked him to keep us informed as we were on our way out of town for the weekend. 

It was no sales tactic...he was totally true to his word, texted us pictures, and even had his manager stop by the yard on Sunday (when they're closed) and unlock it so we could see it when we got back in town. We were blown away by the quality of it. Not only that, when it came time to talk about price, he came in several thousand LOWER than he originally told us, without us even prompting for a drop! Then he offered us a very fair trade value on our current camper. It was really too good to be true.

It took about a week to get all the paperwork done, get the camper cleaned and actually ready to sell, etc, but they never slipped in fees, raised the price, went back on their word or anything. The entire week we kept thinking it was too good to be true and kept waiting for it to fall through, which it never did. Everything happened exactly as planned and not once did we feel pressured to follow through...I felt like if anything wasn't right we could have stopped at any moment and they would have been fine. In fact, I even expressed concern over the age of the tires and the next day all 4 tires were replaced. Crazy!

So in summary, Power RV had awesome prices, incredible unbeatable service, and over the top honesty in the offer and negotiations. We've taken the camper on two trips so far and are still completely thrilled with the purchase...not a speck of that remorse or guilt that sometimes follows a big purchase. A truly enjoyable experience. Thank you Power RV!"
2.5,1,"Absolutely worst ever!!! We went in to look at a toy-hauler which fit all of our short and long term needs, left briefly to retrieve a check for a deposit (since they stated they did not due financing on Saturdays), measure our RZR for garage fitment (yes it would fit), and upon return (45 minutes later) were told that the unit was sold! To someone flying in out of state for tomorrow, which was supposedly the day they are closed to purchase the unit. Horrible experience!!!!!!!"
2.5,2,"When we purchased our Used RV they said everything would get checked out during their PDI and anything that didn't work would be repaired. We also ask them to do a complete service in the engine and transmission and we said we'd pay any extra cost for that service. 
When we picked it up for our walk through the guy said one of the outside storage doors sticks real bad and he suggested how I could fix it (guess that should have been my first clue). I also noticed that their was no rod to pull down the awning and he said that he would get us one, that never happen.
He said they checked the batteries and hydro jacks. Well the battery for the engine was bad and wouldn't hold a charge overnight and the two front jacks leak. 
Now for the engine and transmission service. We didn't even get out of town and the Check Engine Soon light came on ( guess we flushed that $346.00 we paid them).
Oh yes and the engine runs really hot 235 to 240 degrees just driving on the flat through town (found out that was caused by a bad clutch on the engine fan).
It's a really nice RV and besides that it's in great shape but don't believe them when they say they are going to fix everything on the PDI. Get specifics in writing so you can go back on the"
2.5,1,"A no class seller. I drove 2 hours to see two Class A coaches with the intent of buying one of them. The descriptions and online pictures showed what I was looking for, nice well cared for and clean units. 
I arrived and was told one of the units was sold, he thought, that morning maybe. I said well lets look at the other coach. What I saw did not resemble the online pictures. It was nasty and had a terrible odor. In my opinion this was misrepresentation as it did not come close to looking like what was shown online.
I left after 10 minutes total on their lot. Drove another 2 hours back home. Don't waste time dealing with these unprofessional dealers.
I left after the owner shrugged his shoulder and saying I should have called. My bad about the coach that was sold, but their bad by what I saw in the other.
I won't be back, you shouldn't either. Too many good and professional sellers out there."
4,5,"If you need quality RV repairs and maintenance at a reasonable price, you've found the right place! Caleb is fast, extremely efficient, reliable and  knowledgable. (Be sure and make a list of all you want done or examined; these folks don't dawdle or waste a moment of time. i have never seen such efficient people!)

i've been using Bullseye RV since i bought my used 2003 travel trailer over 6 years ago  (i live in it year-round), and i couldn't be happier with their service and work. 

They are honest, trustworthy, and will assess your RV so you know what needs repair or replacement immediately, and what is coming up in the future so you can plan for it. They don't recommend unnecessary work - a rarity in this world, and such a relief!

i was surprised to see that Bullseye RV had only a 4 star rating, so i read the previous reviews. i have never spoken to the ""Larry"" two people were unhappy with; i can only assume he is no longer with the company. i have always dealt with Caleb, with excellent results!"
4,5,"This RV Repair ""Mobile"" is stellar !!  Twice we have called Larry and Caleb.  Right there when we needed them.  PROFESSIONAL to say the least.  Our first experience with them, was to go over our 32 ft Motorhome from top to bottom.  Larry put on vent covers, checked the roof, and all electrical.  Bullseye RV Repair is great, price was excellent and we used them again today.  Bullseye came to our home, in an extreme situation.  Our Refrigerator was on the fritz.  We are due to depart Phoenix on the next day.  Came out after a long day, and worked on it.  
It now works and cooling fine.  We are fine to get on the road.  Many compliments are given to Bullseye RV Repair."
4,5,"Bullseye RV Repair came out to the house & performed several repairs on my 2003 40 ft Eagle.  They were extremely knowledgeable & very professional.  They don't cut corners. I thought a couple of the items on my list were going to take quite some time to fix and be fairly expensive.  I was wrong.  Because of Larry's vast experience, he was able to spot the problems right away and do a 100% fix quickly and very inexpensively.  He replaced a couple of furnace blower motors that were making noise, and the price he charged for the motors was much less than I would have paid at the nearest RV store.  (and he had them on the truck already).

I know who to call for all my future RV repairs.....he made me a happy camper!"
4,5,"Same day service! Fixed my generator, runs great! On time, professional and very knowledgable. Polite and took time to answer my questions. Thank you Larry, A+ service."
4,1,"Spent several thousands of dollars with Larry. He always had an attitude problem but I let it pass?? Last year had him do service on my Aqua Hot. After service it would not start using diesel. He came out and ""fixed"" it? Next trip with RV  it wouldn't start again. He came out again (charged me this time). Stated it was fixed. Went out for the summer and never would start using diesel?? This spring I called and asked him to come work on it. I have extended warrantee company and he said he would no longer work with them?? I told him I would pay him myself. NO RETURNED CALLS OR EMAILS?? JERK. Guess I should have known that by his attitude all along. He never had a problem taking all my money before. WOULD NOT TELL ANYONE TO EVER USE HIM AGAIN!!!"
4,5,"Bullseye RV's Caleb is superlative! Fast, efficient, no nonsense, with a wealth of experience... he will tell you what needs to be done, immediately or at some point in the future. He will NOT tell you to replace or fix something that doesn't need it. Honesty and expertise - can't be beat! I rely on him to keep my 2003 travel trailer (i live in it full time) in good repair. I highly recommend Bullseye RV!

i recently read a couple of unhappy customer reviews that talked about a ""Larry"" at Bullseye RV. i have never seen or talked to a ""Larry,"" and given what was said about his work and lack of integrity, i can only assume that he is no longer with the company. i have always dealt with Caleb, who is phenomenal!"
4,5,"Excellent Service, Trustworthy, Professional!!!

With repairs, advice, and RV owner education, we have come to rely on Caleb and Larry for all of our RV needs. Although I could share a lot of stories that illustrate my rating, there are too many examples to choose from. Take my word, Bullseye RV is an excellent choice and I always feel that Caleb is sensitive to my budgetary restrictions. I have always felt that I got my money's worth."
4,5,"Larry and his son Caleb worked on several issues in my RV this AM.  Both men worked hard, and efficiently.  Their knowledge of the various systems in my coach was impressive, and allowed them to diagnose problems quickly and apply the necessary fixes. Their charges were reasonable and fair.
Bullseye RV Repair is now my go to techs while my coach resides in Phoenix."
4,5,They book me an appointment. They showed up on time with a fully stocked trailer. They identified 3 problems. Fixed all 3 problems. $200. Couldn't be more satisfied. Father and son team. I was honestly surprised. Really good experience.
4,5,"We have had them come out twice to help with the trailer and they have been professional, quick, honest and have done a great job. Twice because the first repair of switching a faulty breaker didn't seem to work. When they came the second time, they found the issue, fixed it and replaced the breaker again at no charge. I highly recommend them for your mobile RV repair needs."
4,5,Larry with Bullseye is a man of his word.  We had used him several times before.  We bought a 2018 Montana fifth wheel and tried to get slide toppers through the dealer.  After the dealer wasted our time for a month to get the slide toppers we finally gave up.  We got back to New River and immediately called Larry at Bullseye.  He came out and measured for the slide toppers.  He texted that evening with a price.  We agreed and he came out a week later and installed them in 2 1/2 hours.  We are so happy with Larry and his quality service.  We will always go to Larry and Bullseye with our RV needs.  Thank you Larry for a job well done.
4,1,"Took our money and ran!!  He underbid the repair on the coach and then refused to finish the job and fix the coach for which he was already paid!! Hired a ""reputable"" company to finish the job and will report him to BBB.  He is a thief!  Please use someone else!"
4,1,Terrible service and attitude. Larry chose to not return phone calls or messages when he left  without being able to fix our motorhome. He was paid in full and I even bought them lunch. He did damage inside the rv and didn't fix until we pointed it out. His word means nothing - he backed out of his warranty and waited for the mfg warranty to run out without fixing the problem.  He ignored us rather than to man-up and admit he just couldn't fix it correctly.
4,1,"There are several reviews that sounded like we wrote it. This repair service knows little to nothing about aquahot. Two repairs and $500 later we had to call on an expert back home. It broke down because they did a shoddy job and huessed at the solution. When I told Larry he said to get him the invoice from our expert. So I have mailed it to him. It was very detailed with every single issue he had to re-repair. We will see how honest Bullseye truly is. Buyer beware. We had to dole out another $470 or so to correct Larry's ignorance on aquahot.
I was right. He never responded after sending the invoices. POS"
4,1,"Slow, Sloppy and Rude. That's Larry with Bullseye RV Repair. You think with the THOUSANDS of dollars I was paying him, he would at least return a phone call, voicemail or text... He did come out and fix one of his leaky mistakes. Ill give him that."
5,5,"Great experience, great staff and superb equipment. I would highly recommend renting an RV from Sand Highway, they are the best. Communication is outstanding and their equipment is new and easy to use. They helped relieve the stress of vacationing in an RV."
5,5,"I can't say enough positive things about Sand Highway RV Rentals. The booking was made easily, even for our first time. We arrived to a warm greeting, the staff was extremely helpful getting us hitched up and on the road. The actual trailer we rented was a toy hauler. It was in great shape and ready to go for us. They walked us through all the ins-and-outs of how it functions and made us feel confident to hit the road. The return was smooth and convenient as well. We most definitely will utilize San Highway again on our next trip in the area. I did my research before choosing them and based on price, customer service and now first hand experience I feel confident recommending them to anyone who is new to the trailer world and want to give it a try or to those experienced with RVs. A+"
5,5,Rented the rzr 1000 turbo! Was a blast!!! Renting was easy and quick! No hassle! Will definitely refer friends and family!
5,5,I rented a 20' box trailer. The staff was very friendly and help full hooking up the hitch they had available. Awesome people to rent from.Thanks for being so accommodating! Will rent from them again.
5,5,"They set me up with the right size trailer for the car I was towing (Honda Civic). Trailer was in mint condition. Showed me how everything worked, including the electric brake controller (this is a must). Process to rent and return was easy. Will definitely rent from here again, they have a huge selection of products."
5,5,"These guys are great. Clean equipment, flexible and friendly people and great inventory selection. I've rented from them twice now and will again."
5,1,"Wow.would give -5 stars for the customer service or lack there of.laura who i was corresponding with for a rzr rental first didnt want to honor a online price then agreed too.then said she would email insurance info to me but never did and gave me attitude saying she did.then wanted to collect deposit over the phone non refundable which would have been ok except she said the weekend i was renting the rzr nascar would be in town and there wouldnt be anyone there and i needed to come down and sign the papers before the pickup date.so i simply suggested ill pay the deposit when i come down and sign the papers. She preceeded to tell me i have attitude and this rental would not work out. What a b****.that's ok she managed to tack on so many extra fees that the rental was 7 dollars short of the price she typically charges.in so happy i didn't give the deposit,in sure they would have never been there for pickup and would have been out my deposit.i rented from OCTANE THRILLS! BETTER PRICE AND REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE...."
5,5,What great individuals and awesome time. I look forward to coming here again one day. Thanks for the great memories!
5,5,"I rented a Polaris RZR 1000 UTV for a long weekend and had an absolute blast. Scheduling was easy via their website and the pick-up was fast and hassle-free - paperwork and payment took just a few minutes and when it was done, the staff already had the trailer loaded and hooked to my car, so I was ready to head out.

The machine was practically new and handled three days of extreme desert use without any problems other than a flat tire from a sharp rock, which I was able to repair in less than five minutes thanks to the provided tire repair kit and air compressor they put in the glove box. 

When I returned it, the machine had some damage to the rocker panels from some boulders I chose to drive over instead of around - they were as understanding as they could be.  Overall, these are NICE people who are easy to do business with and I'll definitely be back.  THANKS for a great weekend of EXTREME FUN!"
5,5,"These rates are amazing, the condition of everything seems brand new. The customer service is polite and friendly. I have already recommended them to two people. I will be back several times,the pontoon boat looks amazing."
5,5,"We rented an awesome RZR 1000 from Sand highway RV! We had so much fun! The machine performed perfect no issues The staff is kind friendly and courteous and wants you to enjoy your trip!! We highly recommend, what a great trip thanks again Sand Highway RV!!"
5,5,We rented a tow dolly from Sands Highway RV rentals for our weekend getaway and we were pleasantly surprised with their customer service and products. We will definitely be renting again from there them in the near future. The ability to reserve online was convenient and an easy process. I highly recommend them
5,5,Best prices around! Quality equipment. They do their best to make the customer happy. Thats hard to find nowadays. Will rent from them again!
5,5,"Rented an enclosed trailer to move our daughter to college in NM - the trailer was great & the service amazing. So glad we got this enclosed trailer as we had rain and lots of it! All the contents would have been ruined if we had not chosen this trailer!  

It's far and out of the way but worth it!"
5,5,"Second time renter from this amazing establishment. 
We first rented a Class C and a RZR, it was incredibly easy to operate ( the staff was very helpful with any questions regarding the operation of the unit) , and even easier to clean! 
We are currently driving back from Northern Arizona in the Class A RV (along with a RZR ) that we rented this trip. The experience was just as good if not better than our last trip! 

Thank you Laura and the wonderful staff at Sand Highway RV Rentals!!!"
5,5,"These guys are wonderful to work with. They have helped me five times now and every time I rent from them them I get great service. I consider myself lucky I found these guys the first time around. Thanks for being so accommodating.
Jonmark"
5,5,My family highly recommends Sand Highway RV Rentals.  First time renting from them and we are beyond satisfied with them.  We rented the RV for NASCAR Phoenix November 2017 and we had them drop off and pick up. Wow! What a great service they provided for us.  It's so worth the money.  We are definitely going to be renting again for March 2018 Phoenix NASCAR! Thanks Sand Highway RV Rentals!!
5,5,"Rented a 20' enclosed trailer. They also provided the essential equalizer and anti-sway hitch at no charge. This is a must for safe trailering empty or loaded.

Their online reservation site is great...images, descriptions and the interactive calendar was awesome

Laura and Curtis were great with the admin and equipment respectively.

The trailer was a late model with new tires; same with the hitch. The trailer tracked perfect.  There were no white-knuckle moments...a completely uneventful trip of 4400 miles.

Cost was reasonable and fair, too.

I would definitely rent from them and absolutely will refer others.

Thank you"
5,5,I had an opportunity to use these guys a couple months ago and they were great!! Everyone was nice and the process was easy. They made sure I was comfortable with the toy hauler before we took off. I definitely recommend them for your next trip!!
5,5,"Wanted to rent a trailer and had a week to do it. Laura was super helpful. Being this was a first time renting/hauling a trailer, the staff showed me how to use. They were also available when I called about the brake controller.

Awesome staff and a wide variety of trailers to rent... Would definitely come back."
5,5,"Smooth, hassle-free transaction.  They're a bit out in the boonies, but their prices are great, making the drive worth it."
5,5,"Wow!  Let's give a big shout out to the entire staff here. You are greeted with a smile. All paperwork is in order and printed ready to go. The owners and everyone working at Sand Highway treat the rental equipment like it is their own. All rentals are clean and in working order.  Nothing rag tag here, all pro's!  Next rental for us will be a motorhome!"
5,5,Love renting from Sand Highway.  The equipment is always in fantastic shape and the service is super quick.  Paperwork/Hookup and I am usually out of there in 20 minutes.  I have used them 4 times and never disappointed.
5,5,"Recently, I rented a trailer to tow my RZR. Laura and Curtis made the process much easier than I thought it would be. I had to change my pick up time and it was no problem. They are very helpful, friendly and organized. The trailer was in excellent condition and their prices are very fair. I will definitely rent from them again!"
5,5,"Best RV Rental ever.  All the features of a big company with the flexibility and friendliness of a small one.  The RV was clean, well maintained, stocked with conveniences. Pick up and drop off was very easy and hassle free. I rarely give recommendations to my friends, but Sand RV has been shared around. It was such pleasure working with them we will do so again."
5,5,"We recently went on an adventure of a lifetime - my husband rode his bicycle across America for Foster Children -and I followed along with our doggie to support him.

With that I had never driven an RV.  We contacted Sand Highway and the entire experience could not have been better.  We rented the 2017 24' Thor Class C from Laura, the owner.

Laura made me feel so comfortable on the entire process - from driving, the black and grey water, the levels, set up - just everything!

The support was unbelievable!  While we were on the road and had any questions, there was always someone to help us.  Additionally, Laura is the most encouraging positive person you would ever want to rent an RV from.  Her comments always included, ""Have a great time on your adventure - have fun!

Because of Sand Highway and Laura, we know exactly where to go for RV needs in the future - SAND HIGHWAY!"
5,5,"We rented a toy hauler from this family-owned company about a month ago, so this review is overdue. We we're having trouble finding a trailer that was available in the area for our weekend, but they suggested that we rent a toy hauler, which we hadn't thought of and it worked out great. The trailer came with basic necessities (dish soap, lighter, spatula, spoon, can opener), and it was clean. I accidentally ripped off a towel rack which I felt pretty bad about, but they just said it happens and didn't charge us extra. When we returned the trailer, they showed us other ones that had already been returned from the weekend that they would recommend for us next time, and they were beautiful! Can't wait for next time!"
2.5,5,"After searching Main St. for an RV for 2 weeks we ended up here.  From Grady showing us the trailer,   Chris in sales, Dick in finance and the guys in the shop, we couldn't of been happier with our experience.  No run around, No hassles, No pressure.  It was just a great experience all around and would recommend to everyone to save yourself some time and just go straight to them."
2.5,5,"Pleasant experience. They even helped us hook the trailer up. Upfront no hassles, no hidden anything. I would recommend them to anyone shopping for a rv or trailer."
2.5,2,"We bought a used 40' Motor home from this dealer.  After immediately collecting their $$ they told us to come back at the end of the week as they would check everything to be sure it worked.  This seemed reasonable at the time.  We were first called to say they had to do more fixes and extended the pickup date 3 more days.   After 3 days the owner called and again extended the pickup time 3 more days for the reason he was short on help thst day.
When we showed up for pickup the RV was parked behind other motorhomed and inaccessible...while 2 people were still working on the vehicle. We spent at least 6 hours waiting for the work, etc. to be completed.   Upon using the RV for about 170 miles, we discovered the Sanicon system does not work.  There were also a number of fuses that were dead causing electrical issues in the coach.  Most likely there are other issues we have not yet discovered.  THE BEST PART is we bought an extended warranty for lots of cash.  They put the wrong mileage on the warranty shorting the 36000 mile warranty by about 20,000 MILES.  This is YET to be resolved and could be an honest mistake..time will tell."
2.5,1,Very unfortunate experience with these guys. Bait and switch.  You make a deal with them the at the last minute they add fees.
2.5,1,"I was not going to write a review on this place, until I got home with my motorhome they had for over 3 weeks. They were to repair an air leak which in all this time, they never found the leak.  I have their work order that clearly states, problem with mirrors. Need adjustments. Left the shop tonight and both mirrors were still not functioning correctly. Right passenger mirror just swung around as I was driving. I pointed out an area on the back engine door that needed touch up to the paint. I pointed it out to the service manager and asked that since they were using 3 colors to touch up sun damage with the gel coat, that they could touch the door up. Under the stress from everything that happened with them this week, I forgot to check their work. Touch up on engine door was not done. I was flabergasted to get a bill today for over $2400.00 for changing  the fluids, filters and odds and ends repairs. I told them they must have used black gold or Texas tea as fluids for that cost.
Bottom line: I purchased a lemon coach from them. In 17 months, even with a top of the line extended warranty that I paid $9000, my coach was in the shop more than I had it. First trip in first 30 days to San Diego and coach broke down. In purchasing my RV, I paid $900 for them to inspect the coach and go over it before delivery. This charge was added by the RV dealer. It took over 45 days for them to fix all the issues that were wrong. It was clearly obvious that the $900 was a gimic to get more of your money. It went down hill from there. We honest to God had it camping a total of 4 weekends and each time something broke down and back to their shop. I'm lucky if I put on 2000 miles in 17 months. Most mileage and fuel were trips back and forth to their shop or another shop. In all the return trips to their garage, I constantly made out bullet  lists of items needing repair. As stated above, in getting the coach back, I'd find items reported were never corrected. Then, the amount of time in the shop. A month at a time or more each trip to the shop. I paid over $136,000 that included tax, not to mention over $15,000 in repairs out of my pocket that the warranty wouldn't cover and never using my coach and paying bill after bill. I spent $100 a month for storage fees because we live in an HOA that wouldn't allow the RV at our home. Yearly insurance was over $1800 to sit in a shop or storage. I paid these monthly fees even having the coach in the shop more than in storage or enjoying it on the road, not to mention Satelite service bills every month in hopes we would get the coach back to go traveling  What a nightmare. I just sold the coach ,lost my butt on the sale to get rid of  it and I can get my life back. I literally have aged over this experience. My opinion as well as many many other RV owners, is Don't buy New or Used. Unless you are filthy rich and don't mind never enjoying your investment and spending tons of money and it always being in a shop, you won't be happy campers. These shops are slow in repairs, lousy in communication, charge outrageous prices and you are on the phone with them all the time. They don't think you work for a living to pay for their junk.  Do your homework and read all the negative reviews with alot of these RV  sales places. Read all the unhappy RV owners having or dealing with the same issues I had. Their quickest service is when you pay them for your lemon. After the money transfers, Good Luck. More effort is put towards getting the sale and than you sit and wait for repairs to get done. In my opinion, it appeared that I was one of many customers frustrated and on hold for them to do the work. I have had 5 motorhomes in my adult life. So many problems and lots of spent money for nothing but tons of stress and aggravation. I'm done with RV's and the whole troubling maze you get into when you buy a motorhome. I am finally free of the ball and chain around my neck for owning a motorhome. Never again in this lifetime will I be dooped into another RV experience. When it comes to Luxury RV, the owner is nice, but nice doesn't fix the problems. What he tells you sounds great, but the service center doesn't know left from right. Great stallers, poor service and lousy communicators. When they tell you it will be done quickly, plan on renting a tent. It will be weeks before getting it back. Makes sense; sell sell, sell and wait, wait, wait for repairs. Join the backed up line. Says something about workmanship and competence."
2.5,1,"Whatever you do, DONOT BUY AN RV HERE!  I bought a new 2017 Sea Breeze in April from this place.  The first issue I had was they actually sent me home with the wrong camper.  That's right....the wrong VIN.  I was the one to catch it or I vouldhave easily paid for my camper and never found out until I went to sell it.  I had to take the camper back in and get my correct camper (45 miles one way).

After using my camper one time, several issues were identified.  The canopy was not installed correctly, the black tank flush valve was installed backwards and thus did not work, the refer cover on the roof was installed incorrectly and flopped all around, one kitchen drawer was installed incorrectly and almost fell out when you opened it more than half way, the shower curtain hold was broken and the shower wall had pulled away from the wall.  I took it back for repairs and told Luxury RV that I could not ce back for a month to pick it up.  3 weeks later, Drew from service called me and told me all the repairs were done.  I told Drew I would be in the following Saturday to pick it up as I was still out of town.  I went in on June 10th to find my camper was not ready.  In fact they still had the door open with tools in it.  On top of that both of my batteries were dead because they had failed to plug it in and keft the bathroom light on.  I spend 4 hours waiting for everything to get done...wasted my day!

I use the camper 3 more times and have another list of repairs.  The front skirting came off while I was driving, one of the batteries bolt stripped, a back lens cover fell off, the bathroom towel hook was about to fall off and I could not get the dvd player to work.  I again took it in for service.  2 1/2 weeks later I call to check on it on a Wednesday.  Rex tells me it hasn't even been touched but they should be able to get it all done by Saturday when I come to pick it up.  On Saturday I call to let them know I am cing in and to have it ready.  Shane (same salesman that sold me the camper) tells me he's in sales and doesn't know what service did.  Well, I pull up to my camper that is blocked in my a motorhome and you guessed it....NOTHING HAS BEEN FIXED!  So I wait aroind for Shane to find the motorhome keys, Bob the owner shows up and tells me that he can't get inyo the service area to at least get me a new battery for my trip.

NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS DEALER!!!"
4,4,"The staff was really nice I called when I was on the road and they told me to come right in for an oil change. My husband was at work so therefore I couldn't go anywhere  but stay in the shop while the work was being done. The shop really doesn't have a ""waiting area"" and kind of left me in an awkward position walking around with my one year old. There were two women in the office I chatted with one of them because she was expecting she was very nice, I also chatted with the owner he was also great and turns out we had a few commonalities both being from the east coast. Everything was great until the work was done on my car... The daughter of the owner basically pushed me out the door, I wasn't even done signing my paper work.. When she said "" we got to get that car out of here"" as she spoke indirectly over to the other female in the office and she was clearly speaking about me And my car. Other then that the experience was fine..."
4,5,Dawn and the crew did a great job on my Fiancé's vehicle when we needed a new water pump. They were quick and thorough and did it all for the price quoted. We'll be returning for any repairs or maintenance we need in the future!
4,5,"Last time I was in Phoenix, I needed a water pump and timing belt for my Honda Accord. Unfortunately, I had the work done by a mechanic I didn't know wasn't certified (Mike Allen of Lifetime Auto). After the repair, the car was running horribly. 

This time, I was staying in Phoenix with a friend and was on my way to Oklahoma. I decided to get my oil changed and my car checked out by Moon Valley Auto care. I asked them to do an inspection.

As I suspected, there were some problems, the major one being that the timing belt was improperly installed. Moon Valley suggested I take it back to the original mechanic since I'd already paid for that repair. The original mechanic insisted that wasn't the problem. He wanted yet more money to do a tune-up and ""if"" that didn't solve the problem, he'd ""look at"" the timing belt. 

I didn't trust the original mechanic. He was supposed to have my car for 24 hours, but had it for five days. He didn't do the work properly and then when a certified mechanic told him that, he didn't believe them. I didn't want to give this guy any more of my money.

Moon Valley performed an oil change, replaced my oil valve cover gasket, the alternator and power steering belts, and they did the timing belt job the way it should have been done in the first place. When I drove away, the car was running perfectly. 

They also gave me a list of other repairs and maintenance I will need in the near future, telling me which ones were most important and which could probably wait.

Dawn and Juan did a fantastic job and left me feeling safe with the work done, as well as more knowledgeable about what other repairs my car will need.

The prices were reasonable, especially since the job was done right. For instance, I paid the other mechanic $400 for a bad timing belt repair. Moon Valley charged me just a little over $400 and the repair was done properly. They had my car ready when they said they would, and they called me with updates when needed.

I would highly recommend Moon Valley and when I return to Phoenix I will definitely have them do any needed repairs."
4,5,Absolutely the best car care I've had. Professional and very helpful. They helped me lay out a plan to keep my vehicle in its best shape possible. They dropped me off when I left my car there and even picked me up to get my car back. I will absolutely be going back!
4,5,"I've found my trusted auto mechanic! Dawn and her team are amazing- professional, thorough, and extremely cost competitive."
4,5,"Who says there's no such thing as angels? I was on my way to a business meeting in Phoenix Saturday morning when I heard a loud sound, then my tire pressure indicator came on to alert me that I was losing air pressure. I quickly pulled over into the first parking lot and opened my door to see the last of the air leaving my tire. I am recently divorced, and have never changed a tire in my life, thanks to the good man I was married to. I wasn't about to start now. I was dressed for a business meeting and didn't think I could do it in my heels and dress slacks. I noticed that I had pulled into the parking lot of Moon Valley Motor Care. ""What luck!"" I thought as I walked up to the door. My hopes were soon dashed when I realized they were not open on Saturdays. I went back to my car and called a towing company. I gave them my credit card number and they said they would have someone there within an hour. I waited about 10 minutes and someone pulled up and asked if I had a flat tire. Of course, I assumed it was someone from the towing company I had just called. He quickly and efficiently changed my tire for me and put the damaged tire in my trunk for me. I thanked him and asked him how I would receive my receipt. He said, ""There's no receipt."" I said, ""What do you mean? I need it to turn in to my insurance company."" He said, ""There is no receipt because there is no charge. I just came in to the shop to pick up some tools and saw you sitting here with a flat tire."" I said, ""You mean you're not with the towing company I just called?"" ""Nope. You should call them back and cancel."" That's what I did. I should have gotten his name so I could properly thank him, but I was so taken aback, and late for my meeting. But I couldn't stop thinking about the angel man with the name ""Audrey"" tattooed on his left arm. I live in Chandler and don't often get to Phoenix on a weekday, but if I ever am, I'm going to stop by and thank him. In the meantime, if you live in Phoenix, stop by and visit this man the next time you need work on your car. His shop is at 14405 N. 7th St., Phoenix, AZ, 85022. I'm sure he'll treat you right."
4,5,I took my 2005 Audi A4 in for a water pump replacement. They fix the water pump and change my oil quickly. The price was consistent with other providers. The service is A+. The mechanic was friendly and showed me what he did to my car and Dawn was very helpful. I will definitely return.
4,2,"MV Motor Care was very helpful in getting my car in, they were also courteous and patient. MVMC has great reviews and I agree this is why I chose to take my car there. Unfortunately, my outcome has not been so nice to put it presentationally. We are still in dispute from the services received from August of 2014 to what I feel was un-authorized and to what Dawn DiMarco felt was authorized work. Although she has offered for a $100.00 off for the future installation of an alternator it is hard for my husband and I to return to MVMC. We hope the owner will see things from our perspective as a business owner that has dealt with customer satisfaction for over twenty years."
4,1,This place is a complete scam and takes advantage of the customers. Woman at the front desk is disrespectful and unprofessional when dealing with the customers. Would not recommend this auto shop to anyone.
4,1,"Moon Valley Auto Repair
Customer BEWARE!!   In  June of 2013, I took my RV to Moon Valley Auto Repair after it had failed emissions control testing.   I drove the vehicle in and towed it out.  After $650 dollars worth of tinkering they had replaced a brand new Auto Parts starter I had just installed not more than 30 days previously with a supposedly superior Delco starter.  Moon Valley told me they would put the Auto Parts starter in the RV and I could take it back for an exchange.   The also replaced a few vacuum hoses but never got the vehicle running.   At this point I was told I now needed a new fly wheel on the transmission with the cost of approximately $1000 and a new radiator and hoses for the additional cost of $1000.  The estimate to get the additional necessary repairs to the vehicle and get it out of the shop was $2000 to $3000.  At this point I knew I had stepped into the auto repair shop scam headquarters ran by a east coast witch named"" Dawn"",  with a screw the suckers attitude to making money and customer service.  The Auto parts starter was never placed in the RV so I could  make a return. I  was told that they returned the new Auto Parts starter for a core charge. 
 I paid the $650 bill without a comment and called a tow truck ($300) to take the RV to part time mechanic  friend who replaced the flywheel for $300.  So the fly wheel was a legitimate needed repair ( although he stated he had never seen a fly wheel damage in this manner) but the radiator and hoses were bogus   Approximately 4 months later after having started the RV a few dozen times the new superior Delco starter that Moon Valley Auto installed went out while on the road.  I had the vehicle towed ($280)to a recommended Glendale mechanic and they replaced the Delco rebuilt starter with a new factory starter that is now working like a champ.  
I took the superior Delco rebuilt starter back to Moon Valley and simply asked them to either return this starter for a new starter or return my money.  I did not ask for my money back for the installation of a faulty starter, I just asked them to replace the starter.  I was told they no longer had a box for the starter and it could not be returned for a refund or a new starter.  I was also told by Dawn that she could not verify that this was even the starter that her shop installed.  When I suggest that she simply check her records to verify the serial number she told me she could not do that.   When I asked for my money back and confronted the owner about the estimates for the radiator and hose work that did not need to be done she threatened to call the police if I did not leave her shop.  
I have since spoken to a neighbor who had a similar experience.  He took his truck to Moon Valley and he was giving a long list of necessary repairs running into the thousands of dollars.  The man then took the truck to his local Chevy dealer for a second estimate.  The Chevy dealer found NO NEED for any of the repairs than Moon Valley had deemed necessary.  They repaired his truck for a few hundred dollars.  
In relating this story to a third auto shop that has just completed the starter repair a mechanic informed me that he once worked for the tow company owned and operated by Moon Valley.  He stated that he had quit after discovering how they operated and also stated "" Those people are crooks with a rude attitude towards customers"".  
End of Story!"
4,5,"12 hours before I'm supposed to drive from Phoenix to Minneapolis, my front wheel bears start to make noise. I just happen to be drive by Moon Valley Motor Care and stopped and talked to mechanic and told him what the problem was. Now keep in mind, it's Friday and two hours before they close. He test drove my truck, told me what it needed and said he could get it done, even if he had to stay late. Top shelf all the way. They offered to drive me to my house and call me when it was done. Their service is next to none and they are very fair on their prices. They could have very easily stuck it to me , especially being in the jam I was in, but didn't. As a contractor who has been in the business for 35 years, you get what you pay for, Moon Valley Motor Care, deserves what they charge. Thanks again for the Great work,"
4,5,"This shop is run by a family, more specifically by the eldest daughter, Dawn. This put me at ease from the very beginning, I feel like men mechanics can spout a bunch of car jargon and know that most women do not have a clue!!!  Therefore charging a ton of money for useless things. 

I took my 12 year old Volvo there for a ""noise"".  Anytime there is a noise, who knows what it really is. I was scared to death it was something major, but it ended up being a simple fix, BUT what I liked was that they alerted me to another more serious issue my other mechanic failed to spot - a crack in the radiator and some worn and dried out hoses. It was not high pressure sales of any kind, simply them finding it, communicating with me, and then letting me make the decision to fix it or wait. 

I was glad they were able to help prevent something bad from happening in the future, for that I am very thankful."
4,5,Traveling across the country from the east coast and needed to get my car checked. i was referred to Moon Valley Motor Care by a friend who I was staying with. They were super nice and super clear with all the problems with the car. They even offered to drive me back to the place I was staying  and pick me up when the car was ready! There were a lot of issues and cost (and the mechanics were able to explain and show me directly the whats and the whys) but Dawn was nice enough to check the tire pressure sensors for free as one thing less to stress about. If I am ever in the area again and have car issues I would definitely go here again. Thank you Dawn for your help!
4,5,"First off, I will say that this is the best, most friendly privately owned oil change/repair shop I have ever been to!! I drive a vehicle that is only a couple years old and my air-conditioner quit blowing cold air randomly. I went to the dealership where I purchased the truck (and a brand new Tahoe last year) and they told me they could not get me in today and basically to screw off. well, in Arizona going in couple of days without air-conditioning in your vehicle is a nightmare already and for them to tell me they could not get me in today (Friday) is very poor customer service, especially whenever you buy two vehicles brand-new from them. I needed it fixed asap so I found this place through Google maps and decided to stop here on my way out of town. I was a little bit skeptical at first because of how small the place was and did not look like the type of place you would take a vehicle that's only two or three years old to.. I was completely wrong!! They were able to get me in right away and got my air-conditioner blowing cold air. The service guy actually showed me what was wrong and was very personable and polite. A week ago I took my truck to the dealership to get some recalls taken care of, got my oil changed, and basically for a check up to make sure everything is working properly. They failed to fill up my washer fluid, which is a small issue and I can do it myself, but Moon Valley Motor topped it off for me and made sure everything was good to go before I drove out of town. The dealership never even checked the air conditioning (on the paperwork it shows everything that they checked and the a/c was one of them). I recommend this place to everybody no matter what, even if your car is under warranty or brand-new, they offer the best service in the valley and I will be returning. Even though my truck is still under warranty, I would rather pay to get my truck worked on and go to Moon Valley Motor than go back to the dealership to deal with their crappy service department."
4,5,"I would not even consider taking my vehicle to any other auto repair business.  Dawn is such a delight and blows me away with her knowledge of auto repair and maintenance. The mechanics are fabulous and go the extra mile to figure our what is causing my vehicle's problem and get it fixed.  Whether it is for routine service or a mechanical issue, Moon Valley Motor Care makes it a pleasant experience."
4,1,"My wife and I have been customers of this shop for about four years and have spent literally thousands of dollars on repairs for our vehicles over the years. To that end, we have enjoyed pretty decent service from them. Only decent because we have sometimes had to bring the vehicles back to have repairs corrected, or found that instructions were not communicated properly between the owner and the mechanics. However, we didn't experience anything so terrible that it would cause us to change mechanics. Until now...

My wife had an experience with the shop; and the owner in particular which has caused us to rethink our choice of auto mechanics. We had an older minivan that we had actually purchased through her shop. It was okay at first, but in the first year needed over 2K in repairs. Last week my wife brought the vehicle into the shop because it was having more issues. After the owner got the car on the lift she let us know that the repairs would total $1200. At that point we decided enough was enough and decided to buy a new car instead of sinking more money into this vehicle. 

My wife told the owner not to do the repairs and that we would make arrangements to get the vehicle removed from the repair shop. Later the same day, she called us again and said that the car was still on the rack and had we made a decision about getting the minivan repaired? My wife told the owner (again) that we were not going to get the vehicle repaired. I'm not sure why it didn't sink in the first time, but when she realized that her shop wasn't going to be doing the repairs, she pitched a fit over the phone about the car sitting on the rack and why didn't we tell her this time first time. Amazing...

So, she said that she was going to charge us $100 dollars for the diagnostic. My wife and I didn't find that to be an unreasonable charge, so we paid it. Then, the owner of the shop went on to say that if we wanted it put back together, it would be another $100. We chose not to pay that because it seemed like a disreputable practice to charge extra to put the engine parts back where they belong. When my wife got to the van the next day, there were engine parts in a pile right on the seat in the car. 

The level of disrespect and ""take it or leave it"" attitude that my wife received is causing us to sever our relationship with this repair shop."
4,1,Exceptionally rude on phone when I called. Sure glad I didn't have a vehicle there. So glad I don't have to deal with this place. Feel sorry for anyone who chooses to deal with this place. No reason to be rude on the phone.

I refer all my friends and family to Moon Valley for routine maintenance, diagnostic and repairs. They are honest, upfront and stand behind their quality of workmanship! If you are looking for an honest mechanic, look no further!"

Family business with great professionalism, good prices and the repairs they completed made my truck run much better.  Thanks!"
