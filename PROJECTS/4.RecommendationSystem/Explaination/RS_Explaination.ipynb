It recommends movies based on **textual similarity of their metadata**, rather than user behavior or ratings.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Problem Statement\n","\n","The goal was to recommend movies that are similar in *content* to a movie the user selects — things like plot, genres, actors, and keywords.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing\n","\n","I used two TMDB datasets:\n","\n","* `movies.csv`: includes movie overviews, genres, keywords.\n","* `credits.csv`: includes cast and crew details.\n","\n","I merged these on the movie title and extracted relevant features:\n","\n","* **Genres, keywords, top 3 cast members, and director**.\n","* Cleaned the text (e.g., removed spaces in names like \"Tom Cruise\" → \"TomCruise\").\n","* Combined everything into a single text field called **`tags`**, which served as the input for NLP.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 2: Vectorization and Similarity\n","\n","I converted the `tags` field to numerical vectors using **CountVectorizer**, with:\n","\n","* A max vocabulary size of 5000\n","* Removal of English stopwords\n","\n","Then, I computed the **cosine similarity** between vectors to identify movies with similar content. This gave me a similarity matrix that I use to find top recommendations for any given movie.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 3: Recommendation Logic\n","\n","When a user selects a movie, I:\n","\n","* Look up its index in the dataset\n","* Fetch its similarity scores with all other movies\n","* Sort them and return the top 5 most similar ones (excluding the selected movie)\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 4: Fetching Posters via TMDB API\n","\n","To make the UI more engaging, I used the **TMDB API** to fetch high-resolution movie posters using the `movie_id`.\n","\n","* The API returns a poster path, which I converted to a full image URL.\n","* This helps visually reinforce the recommendations.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 5: Frontend with Streamlit\n","\n","I used **Streamlit** to build the UI:\n","\n","* Dropdown to select a movie\n","* On button click, it shows 5 recommended movies\n","* Posters and titles are displayed side-by-side using columns\n","\n","I also serialized the similarity matrix and movie metadata using `pickle` for faster loading in the web app.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Tech Stack Summary\n","\n","* **NLP**: CountVectorizer + Cosine Similarity\n","* **Data**: Pandas, NumPy, CSVs\n","* **API**: TMDB for poster thumbnails\n","* **UI**: Streamlit for interactive frontend\n","* **Serialization**: Pickle for storing precomputed data\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Key Learnings\n","\n","* Learned how to extract and engineer meaningful features from messy text and JSON data.\n","* Understood how to apply NLP techniques for similarity-based recommendations.\n","* Gained experience integrating external APIs and building user-facing web apps.\n","* Demonstrated full-cycle development — from data wrangling to frontend deployment.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Omh8I5mEgIPA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"bDBEl-angSh2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
