Project Understanding & Design\n","\n","* **How does content-based differ from collaborative filtering?**\n","  Content-based recommends items similar to those a user liked based on item features, while collaborative filtering uses user interaction patterns across many users.\n","\n","* **Why CountVectorizer over TF-IDF or embeddings?**\n","  CountVectorizer is simple, fast, and works well with limited textual data; embeddings can be more accurate but require more resources.\n","\n","* **What happens if two movies are similar but one is more popular?**\n","  This method doesn’t consider popularity, so popular movies might not always rank higher — a limitation to address.\n","\n","* **Why cosine similarity?**\n","  Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors, focusing on direction rather than magnitude, which suits text similarity well.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. NLP & Feature Engineering\n","\n","* **Text preprocessing done?**\n","  Lowercasing, removing spaces, and combining tags; no stopwords removal or stemming applied.\n","\n","* **Would TF-IDF help over Bag-of-Words?**\n","  TF-IDF could reduce the weight of common words and highlight unique terms, potentially improving recommendations.\n","\n","* **How to improve 'tags'?**\n","  Use NLP techniques like lemmatization, named entity recognition, or add metadata like genres and keywords.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Scalability & Performance\n","\n","* **Scalability for 1 million movies?**\n","  Computing full similarity matrix is expensive; approximate nearest neighbor methods or indexing needed.\n","\n","* **New movie addition?**\n","  Currently requires recomputing similarity; can implement incremental updates for efficiency.\n","\n","* **Real-time recommendations?**\n","  Precompute embeddings and use fast search indices like FAISS for real-time querying.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Frontend & API Integration\n","\n","* **How does Streamlit communicate with backend?**\n","  All logic runs in the same app; Streamlit calls Python functions directly.\n","\n","* **Why TMDB API? Rate limits?**\n","  TMDB offers rich poster data; rate limits exist, so caching posters is advised.\n","\n","* **Could it work offline?**\n","  If poster images are cached locally and no API calls are needed, yes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Limitations & Improvements\n","\n","* **Limitations of content-based?**\n","  Cold start problem, lack of diversity, and no user preference learning.\n","\n","* **Improve with deep learning?**\n","  Use pretrained language models like BERT for richer text embeddings.\n","\n","* **Generative model for recommendations?**\n","  Could generate personalized recommendations based on user profiles and content.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. Deployment & Reusability\n","\n","* **Why pickle for serialization?**\n","  Simple for prototyping; but not secure or scalable for production.\n","\n","* **How to deploy?**\n","  Containerize with Docker, expose REST API, and deploy on cloud platforms.\n","\n","* **Track/version models?**\n","  Use tools like MLflow or DVC to manage model lifecycle.\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","* **Add user ratings, redesign?**\n","  Combine content-based with collaborative filtering to personalize better.\n","\n","* **Challenges faced?**\n","  Integrating TMDB API reliably and optimizing recommendation speed.\n","\n","* **Key learning?**\n","  Importance of clean data, model evaluation, and user-friendly UI.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"DMZ4S6bjhpl_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"6RAa6dFdhuKt"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
