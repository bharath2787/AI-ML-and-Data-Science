# English to Hindi Translator Web App

## Project Overview

This project implements an English to Hindi language translator using a deep learning-based Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. The solution covers the entire machine learning pipeline, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and finally, deployment readiness via a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

The core of the translation system is an Encoder-Decoder architecture that learns to map English sentences to their Hindi equivalents. The trained models and tokenizers are persisted, allowing for efficient inference and integration into the interactive Streamlit application.

## Features

* **Neural Machine Translation:** Utilizes a custom Seq2Seq LSTM model for English to Hindi translation.
* **End-to-End Pipeline:** Demonstrates data handling, model building, training, and prediction.
* **Model Persistence:** Saves trained Keras models (Encoder and Decoder) and tokenizers for easy loading and deployment.
* **Interactive Web UI:** Provides a simple and intuitive web interface using Streamlit for real-time translation.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for modularity, allowing for future enhancements (e.g., Attention Mechanism, larger datasets).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Primary programming language.
* **TensorFlow 2.x:** Deep learning framework for building and training the Seq2Seq model.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and data manipulation.
* **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web application.
* **`pickle`:** For serializing and deserializing Python objects (tokenizers).
* **`zipfile`, `io`:** For data extraction.

## Project Structure

The project is organized to keep models, data, and application code separate for clarity and maintainability.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your_repository_url>
cd language_translator_app
````

*(Replace `<your_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)*

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment (like `conda` or `venv`) to manage dependencies.

Using `conda`:

```bash
conda create -n translator_env python=3.9 # Or your preferred Python version
conda activate translator_env
```

Using `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv translator_env
source translator_env/bin/activate # On Windows: .\translator_env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt` content:**

```
tensorflow>=2.5.0
numpy>=1.20.0
streamlit>=1.0.0
scikit-learn # (If used, for train-test split, otherwise remove)
```

*(Note: You might need to add `scikit-learn` if you use `train_test_split` from it. Otherwise, remove it from `requirements.txt`)*

### 4\. Download and Prepare Data (Manual Step or via Training Script)

The training script (e.g., `training_notebook.ipynb` if you create one, or the initial data collection part of your capstone report code) handles downloading and unzipping the dataset. Ensure you have the `hin-eng.zip` file in the `data/` directory.

The model expects the data structure from `http://www.manythings.org/anki/hin-eng.zip`.

```bash
# From the project root directory
mkdir data
cd data
wget [http://www.manythings.org/anki/hin-eng.zip](http://www.manythings.org/anki/hin-eng.zip) --quiet
unzip hin-eng.zip
cd ..
```

### 5\. Train the Model (If not already trained)

If you haven't trained the models yet, you need to run the training script or notebook (e.g., `training_notebook.ipynb`). This will generate the `seq2seq_encoder_eng_hin.h5`, `seq2seq_decoder_eng_hin.h5`, `encoder_tokenizer_eng`, and `decoder_tokenizer_hin` files in the `models/` directory.

**Ensure your `models/` directory contains these files before running the `app.py` script.**

## How to Run the Web Application

Once the setup is complete and models are trained/saved, you can run the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will open a new tab in your default web browser (or provide a URL) where you can interact with the English to Hindi Translator.

## Usage

1.  Open the Streamlit application in your web browser.
2.  Type or paste an English sentence into the provided text area.
3.  Click the "Translate" button.
4.  The Hindi translation will appear below the input box.


## Possible Enhancements

  * **Attention Mechanism:** Integrate an attention layer to improve translation quality.
  * **Visualize Attention:** Implement visualization of attention weights within the UI to show model focus.
  * **Larger Datasets/Pre-trained Models:** Train on more extensive datasets or leverage pre-trained embeddings/transformer models for higher accuracy.
  * **Bidirectional Encoder:** Use Bidirectional LSTMs for richer context understanding.
  * **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Add functionality to speak the translated Hindi text.
  * **Batch Prediction:** Optimize `decode_sentence` for batch processing if translating multiple sentences.
