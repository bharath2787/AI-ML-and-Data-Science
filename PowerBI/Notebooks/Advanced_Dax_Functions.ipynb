Performs dynamic, **filter-based calculations**\n","* Enables **context transition** (from row → filter context)\n","* Required for **Time Intelligence** functions\n","\n","####  **Example: Total Sales for Karnataka only**\n","\n","```dax\n","KarnatakaSales = CALCULATE(SUM(SalesData[Sales]), SalesData[State] = \"Karnataka\")\n","\n","\n","KarnatakaAssamSales = CALCULATE(\n","

Can filter based on **measure values**, not just column values\n","\n","####  **Example: Sales where Quantity > 5**\n","\n","```dax\n","Sales_QtyAbove5 =\n","CALCULATE(\n","

filter context vs row context** is essential to mastering DAX in Power BI.\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  1. **Filter Context** (What filters apply?)\n","\n","###  Definition:\n","\n","> **Filter context** refers to the filters that are **in effect** when a DAX expression is evaluated — usually due to slicers, visuals, page filters, or explicitly set filters in `CALCULATE`.\n","\n","###  Example:\n","\n","If you have a table visual showing sales by `State`, when DAX calculates:\n","\n","```dax\n","SUM(SalesData[Sales])\n","```\n","\n","for the row `State = Karnataka`, Power BI **automatically applies** that filter — so the `SUM` only includes Karnataka's rows.\n","\n","That’s **filter context** in action — it comes from **outside** the formula.\n","\n","###  You modify filter context using:\n","\n","* `CALCULATE(...)`\n","* Slicers, filters, rows in a visual\n","* Page-level or report-level filters\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  2. **Row Context** (One row at a time)\n","\n","###  Definition:\n","\n","> **Row context** happens when DAX is evaluating **each row individually**, like in calculated columns or `X` functions (like `SUMX`, `COUNTAX`, etc.).\n","\n","###  Example:\n","\n","Let’s say you create a calculated column:\n","\n","```dax\n","NewPrice = SalesData[Unit Price] * SalesData[Quantity]\n","```\n","\n","For each row, DAX knows **what the current row is** — that’s row context.\n","\n","It's like saying:\n","\n","> “While I'm looking at *this row*, I’ll multiply Unit Price and Quantity just for this row.”\n","\n","Row context happens in:\n","\n","* **Calculated columns**\n","* **`X`-functions** like `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`, `COUNTAX`\n","* **Row iterators** like `FILTER`, `ADDCOLUMNS`\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  Key
