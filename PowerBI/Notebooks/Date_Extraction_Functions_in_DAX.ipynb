**Definition:**\n","\n","`DATEDIFF()` returns the **count of interval boundaries** between two dates.\n","\n","> It's like asking: **“How many days/months/years are between Date A and Date B?”**\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **Syntax:**\n","\n","```dax\n","DATEDIFF(<start_date>, <end_date>, <interval>)\n","```\n","\n","* `<start_date>`: The earlier date\n","* `<end_date>`: The later date\n","* `<interval>`: Unit of time you want the difference in\n","  (like `DAY`, `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, etc.)\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **Valid Interval Values:**\n","\n","| Interval  | Description            |\n","| --------- | ---------------------- |\n","| `SECOND`  | Difference in seconds  |\n","| `MINUTE`  | Difference in minutes  |\n","| `HOUR`    | Difference in hours    |\n","| `DAY`     | Difference in days     |\n","| `WEEK`    | Difference in weeks    |\n","| `MONTH`   | Difference in months   |\n","| `QUARTER` | Difference in quarters |\n","| `YEAR`    |

Notes:\n","\n","* `DATEDIFF` **always rounds down** to the full interval count — e.g., 1 year and 11 months = **1** year.\n","* If the start date is **after** the end date, you’ll get a **negative
