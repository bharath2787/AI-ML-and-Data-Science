You can also use raw strings (`r\"string\"`) to prevent escape sequences from being processed.\n","\n","```python\n","raw_string_example = r\"Hello\\tWorld\\nPython!\"\n","print(raw_string_example)\n","```\n","\n","This will output:\n","\n","```\n","Hello\\tWorld\\nPython!\n","```\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RKcZCbZgVzb7"}}]}
