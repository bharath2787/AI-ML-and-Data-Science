Reverse a String\n","Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Check Palindrome\n","Write a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (i.e., the string reads the same backward as forward). Consider ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Count Vowels and Consonants\n","Write a Python function that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a string.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Remove Duplicates\n","Write a Python function that removes all duplicate characters from a string while preserving the order of the original characters.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Find the First Non-Repeated Character\n","Write a Python function that returns the first non-repeated character in a string. If there is no such character, return `None`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. Substring Occurrences\n","Write a Python function that counts the number of times a given substring appears in a string (overlapping substrings should also be counted).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. Convert to Title Case\n","Write a Python function that converts a string to title case (each word starts with an uppercase letter and the rest of the letters are lowercase).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8. String Compression\n","Write a Python function that compresses a string by counting the occurrences of each character and returning a new string where each character is followed by its count. For example, `\"aaabbbcc\"` should be compressed to `\"a3b3c2\"`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 9. Replace All Occurrences of a Character\n","Write a Python function that takes a string and a character as input, and replaces all occurrences of that character with a new character in the string.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 10. Check for Anagram\n","Write a Python function that checks if two strings are anagrams (i.e., they contain the same characters in a different order). The function should return `True` if they are anagrams and `False` otherwise.\n","\n","An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.\n","\n","Examples of Anagram Strings:\n","\"listen\" → \"silent\"\n","\"heart\" → \"earth\"\n","\"evil\" → \"vile\"\n","\"dusty\" → \"study\"\n","\"angel\" → \"glean\"\n","\n","Non-Anagram Examples:\n","\"hello\" ≠ \"world\" (Different letters)\n","\"test\" ≠ \"taste\" (Extra letter 'a')\n","\"python\" ≠ \"typhon\" (Not using the same number of letters)\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 11. Extract Digits from a String\n","Write a Python function that extracts all digits from a given string and returns them as a new string. If there are no digits, return an empty string.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 12. Swap Case\n","Write a Python function that swaps the case of each character in a given string (i.e., lowercase letters become uppercase, and uppercase letters become lowercase).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 13. Find Longest Word\n","Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the longest word in that string. If there are multiple longest words, return the first one.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 14. Remove Leading and Trailing Whitespaces\n","Write a Python function that removes any leading and trailing whitespaces from a string. If the string is empty or contains only whitespaces, return an empty string.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 15. Check if String Contains Only Digits\n","Write a Python function that checks if a given string contains only digits. Return `True` if the string contains only digits, otherwise return `False`.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"kxhFSB2RaQlv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"tMN9tyHraQ8r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
