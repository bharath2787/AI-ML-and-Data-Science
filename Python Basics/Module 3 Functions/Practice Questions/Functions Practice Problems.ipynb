Provide examples of each.\n","\n","2. **Problem 2:**  \n","   Write a Python program that uses the inbuilt `max()` function to find the largest number in a list. Compare it with the output from a user-defined function that performs the same task.\n","\n","3. **Problem 3:**  \n","   Use the inbuilt `len()` function to find the length of a string. Then, create a user-defined function that takes a string as input and returns its length.\n","\n","### **User-Defined Functions**\n","4. **Problem 4:**  \n","   Write a user-defined function `greet_user(name)` that takes a user's name as an argument and prints a greeting message (\"Hello, {name}\").\n","\n","5. **Problem 5:**  \n","   Create a function `calculate_area(radius)` that calculates and returns the area of a circle (Ï€ * radius^2). Test it with different radius values.\n","\n","6. **Problem 6:**  \n","   Define a user-defined function `is_even(num)` that checks whether a number is even or not. The function should return `True` if the number is even and `False` if it is odd.\n","\n","7. **Problem 7:**  \n","   Write a user-defined function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a given number. Handle the base case and recursive calls properly.\n","\n","### **Function Arguments**\n","8. **Problem 8:**  \n","   Write a Python function `sum_numbers(a, b)` that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Call the function with positional arguments.\n","\n","9. **Problem 9:**  \n","   Create a function `introduce_yourself(name, age)` that takes two arguments, `name` and `age`, and prints a short introduction. Call the function with keyword arguments.\n","\n","10. **Problem 10:**  \n","    Define a function `multiply(x, y=5)` where the second argument has a default value of 5. Call the function with both positional and keyword arguments.\n","\n","### **Types of Function Arguments**\n","11. **Problem 11:**  \n","    Write a function `display_info(name, *hobbies)` that accepts a required argument `name` and a variable number of hobby arguments. Print the name and hobbies.\n","\n","12. **Problem 12:**  \n","    Create a function `get_person_info(name, **details)` that accepts a required argument `name` and a variable number of keyword arguments for additional details (e.g., age, address). Print all details inside the function.\n","\n","13. **Problem 13:**  \n","    Define a function `calculate_total_price(price, discount=0, *extra_fees)` that accepts a price, an optional discount, and any number of additional fees as arguments. The function should return the total price after applying the discount and adding extra fees.\n","\n","### **Actual Arguments**\n","14. **Problem 14:**  \n","    Given the function `add(a, b)`, call it with different types of actual arguments (positional, keyword, and default) and explain the result for each case.\n","\n","15. **Problem 15:**  \n","    Write a function `make_tea(tea_type, *extras, **preferences)` that takes a required argument `tea_type`, an optional variable number of extras (like sugar, milk), and a variable number of keyword preferences (like strength, temperature). Call the function with various combinations of actual arguments and print the result.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"67y3pyrbtIWZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"qE6ORDjitLDE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
