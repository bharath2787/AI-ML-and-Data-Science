It **hides implementation details** and only exposes essential functionalities to the user. This is typically achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces** (via the `ABC` module in Python).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Payment Processing System**\n","üîπ **Use Case:**  \n","A **payment gateway system** that supports multiple payment methods (**Credit Card, PayPal, UPI**) while hiding the implementation details from the user.\n","\n","üîπ **How Abstraction is Used?**  \n","- We define an **abstract class** `PaymentProcessor` with an abstract method `process_payment()`.  \n","- Concrete classes (`CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, `UPIPayment`) **inherit** from the abstract class and implement the `process_payment()` method.  \n","\n","```python\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","# Abstract Class\n","class PaymentProcessor(ABC):\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def process_payment(self, amount):\n","        \"\"\"Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses\"\"\"\n","        pass\n","\n","# Concrete Class for Credit Card Payments\n","class CreditCardPayment(PaymentProcessor):\n","    def process_payment(self, amount):\n","        print(f\"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}\")\n","\n","# Concrete Class for PayPal Payments\n","class PayPalPayment(PaymentProcessor):\n","    def process_payment(self, amount):\n","        print(f\"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}\")\n","\n","# Concrete Class for UPI Payments\n","class UPIPayment(PaymentProcessor):\n","    def process_payment(self, amount):\n","        print(f\"Processing UPI payment of ${amount}\")\n","\n","# Client Code\n","def make_payment(payment_method: PaymentProcessor, amount):\n","    payment_method.process_payment(amount)\n","\n","# Example Usage\n","credit_payment = CreditCardPayment()\n","paypal_payment = PayPalPayment()\n","upi_payment = UPIPayment()\n","\n","make_payment(credit_payment, 100)  # Output: Processing credit card payment of $100\n","make_payment(paypal_payment, 50)   # Output: Processing PayPal payment of $50\n","make_payment(upi_payment, 20)      # Output: Processing UPI payment of $20\n","```\n","\n","üîπ **Why is this an Example of Abstraction?**  \n","- The user **does not need to know** how each payment method is implemented.  \n","- The `PaymentProcessor` abstract class ensures a **common interface** for all payment types.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Database Connectivity with Multiple Databases**\n","üîπ **Use Case:**  \n","A system that connects to **different databases** (**MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite**) but provides a **common interface** for the user.\n","\n","üîπ **How Abstraction is Used?**  \n","- The abstract class `DatabaseConnector` provides the methods `connect()` and `disconnect()`.  \n","- Concrete classes (`MySQLConnector`, `PostgreSQLConnector`, `SQLiteConnector`) implement their own **connection logic**.\n","\n","```python\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","# Abstract Class\n","class

MySQL\n","class MySQLConnector(DatabaseConnector):\n","    def connect(self):\n","        print(\"Connecting to MySQL Database...\")\n","    \n","    def disconnect(self):\n","        print(\"Disconnecting from MySQL Database...\")\n","\n","# Concrete Class for PostgreSQL\n","class PostgreSQLConnector(DatabaseConnector):\n","    def connect(self):\n","        print(\"Connecting to

SQLite Database...\")\n","\n","# Client Code\n","def database_operations(db: DatabaseConnector):\n","    db.connect()\n","    print(\"Performing database operations...\")\n","    db.disconnect()\n","\n","# Example Usage\n","mysql_db = MySQLConnector()\n","postgres_db = PostgreSQLConnector()\n","sqlite_db = SQLiteConnector()\n","\n","database_operations(mysql_db)\n","# Output:\n","# Connecting to MySQL Database...\n","# Performing database operations...\n","# Disconnecting from MySQL Database...\n","\n","database_operations(postgres_db)\n","# Output:\n","# Connecting to PostgreSQL Database...\n","# Performing database operations...\n","# Disconnecting from PostgreSQL Database...\n","```\n","\n","üîπ **Why is this an Example of Abstraction?**  \n","- The `DatabaseConnector` class **hides the implementation details** of each database connection.  \n","- The user only interacts with the **common interface** (`connect()` and `disconnect()` methods).  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Notification System (Email, SMS, Push Notifications)**\n","üîπ **Use Case:**  \n","A system that can send **email, SMS, and push notifications**, without exposing their internal implementation.\n","\n","üîπ **How Abstraction is Used?**  \n","- The abstract class `Notification` defines a common method `send_notification()`.  \n","- The concrete classes (`EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, `PushNotification`) implement their own logic.\n","\n","```python\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","# Abstract Class\n","class

PushNotification()\n","\n","notify_user(email, \"Your order has been shipped.\")\n","notify_user(sms, \"Your OTP is 1234.\")\n","notify_user(push, \"New updates available.\")\n","```\n","\n","üîπ **Why is this an Example of Abstraction?**  \n","- The `Notification` class ensures a **standard method** for sending notifications.  \n","- The actual implementation (`EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, `PushNotification`) is **hidden** from the user.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Machine Learning Model Interface**\n","üîπ **Use Case:**  \n","A **machine learning framework** that supports different models (**Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Networks**) while **hiding implementation details** from the user.\n","\n","üîπ **How Abstraction is Used?**  \n","- The `MLModel` abstract class defines `train()` and `predict()` methods.  \n","- Concrete classes implement their own training and prediction logic.\n","\n","```python\n","from abc import ABC,
