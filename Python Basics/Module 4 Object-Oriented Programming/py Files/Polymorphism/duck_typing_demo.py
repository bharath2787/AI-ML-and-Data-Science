ü¶Ü Duck Typing Demo for a Mathematics Problem in Python
In duck typing, Python doesn't check an object's type; instead, it checks if the object has the required method.
"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck!"

üöÄ Scenario:
We will create a function that performs addition on different types of objects (integers, floats, lists, tuples, NumPy arrays).

Instead of checking types explicitly, we assume that the object supports the + operator.
This is duck typing in action!


üìù Explanation:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Classes (Number and ListNumbers)

These classes implement the __add__ method, allowing + operator usage.
Duck Typing lets us call perform_addition() without checking types.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Flexible perform_addition()

Works with integers, lists, tuples, NumPy arrays, and user-defined objects.
As long as an object supports +, Python executes it without complaints.


How does this work for different types?

If a is a ListNumbers object, it calls ListNumbers.__add__(), which performs element-wise addition.
If a is a tuple, Python calls the built-in tuple __add__(), which performs concatenation.
If a is a NumPy array, it calls numpy.ndarray.__add__(), which performs element-wise addition.
If a is a Number object, it calls Number.__add__(), which performs numeric addition.
