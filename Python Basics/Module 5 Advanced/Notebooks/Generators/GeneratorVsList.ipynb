Lists, on the other hand, need to store all values in memory at once. Depending on the context, generators can also be faster when you're processing large datasets and only need to access items one by one."],"metadata":{"id":"ELb8ysokjT5S"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"DFdFVGOijUI0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
