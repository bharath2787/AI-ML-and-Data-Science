Custom Iteration Over Complex Data Structures**  \n","- When working with **trees, graphs, linked lists, or other complex data structures**, iterators allow custom traversal logic.  \n","\n","**Example: Iterating through a binary tree using an iterator**  \n","```python\n","class TreeNode:\n","    def __init__(self, value):\n","        self.value = value\n","        self.left = None\n","        self.right = None\n","\n","class BinaryTreeIterator:\n","    def __init__(self, root):\n","        self.stack = []\n","        self.push_left(root)\n","\n","    def push_left(self, node):\n","        while node:\n","            self.stack.append(node)\n","            node = node.left\n","\n","    def __iter__(self):\n","        return self\n","\n","    def __next__(self):\n","        if not self.stack:\n","            raise StopIteration\n","        node = self.stack.pop()\n","        value = node.value\n","        self.push_left(node.right)\n","        return value\n","\n","# Example usage:\n","root = TreeNode(10)\n","root.left = TreeNode(5)\n","root.right = TreeNode(15)\n","iterator = BinaryTreeIterator(root)\n","for val in iterator:\n","    print(val)  # Output: 5, 10, 15 (in-order traversal)\n","```\n","🔹 **When to use this?**  \n","- **Tree traversals**, **custom collections**, **pagination systems**, **data processing frameworks**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","✅ **2.
