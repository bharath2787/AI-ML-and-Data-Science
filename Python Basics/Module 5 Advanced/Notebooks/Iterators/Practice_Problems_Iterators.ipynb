Create a Custom Iterator for Counting**  \n","   Implement a class `Counter` that behaves like an iterator, counting from `1` to `n`.  \n","   ```python\n","   counter = Counter(5)\n","   for num in counter:\n","       print(num)  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Create an Iterator for Even Numbers**  \n","   Define a class `EvenNumbers(n)` that iterates over even numbers up to `n`.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Implement an Infinite Iterator**  \n","   Create an iterator `InfiniteCounter(start)` that starts at `start` and increments indefinitely.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Implement a String Iterator**  \n","   Write a class `StringIterator` that iterates over characters in a string one at a time.  \n","   ```python\n","   it = StringIterator(\"hello\")\n","   for char in it:\n","       print(char)  # Output: 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5.

Create an Iterator for Squares of Numbers**  \n","   Write an iterator `SquareIterator(n)` that yields squares of numbers from `0` to `n-1`.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Implement a Reverse Iterator for a List**  \n","   Create `ReverseIterator(lst)`, which iterates over a list in reverse order.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8.
