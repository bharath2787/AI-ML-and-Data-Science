These errors are harder to detect because they don’t raise exceptions.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **1. Using `==` Instead of `=` (Assignment vs. Comparison)**\n","   ```python\n","   x == 10  # Mistakenly using '==' instead of '='\n","   print(x)  # NameError: name 'x' is not defined\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** `x` is never assigned a value.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   x = 10  # Use '=' for assignment\n","   print(x)  # Output: 10\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Incorrect Loop Condition Leading to Infinite Loop**\n","   ```python\n","   i = 0\n","   while i < 5:\n","       print(i)\n","       # Forgot to increment 'i', leading to infinite loop\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** The loop runs forever.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   i = 0\n","   while i < 5:\n","       print(i)\n","       i += 1  # Increment 'i' to avoid infinite loop\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Off-by-One Error in Loop**\n","   ```python\n","   for i in range(1, 5):  # Intending to print numbers from 1 to 5\n","       print(i)\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** The loop prints numbers **1 to 4**, but the intention was **1 to 5**.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   for i in range(1, 6):  # Adjust range to include 5\n","       print(i)\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Wrong Order of Boolean Conditions**\n","   ```python\n","   age = 18\n","   if age > 21 and age < 18:  \n","       print(\"Invalid Age\")\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** The condition is never true.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   if age < 18 or age > 21:\n","       print(\"Invalid Age\")\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Incorrect Use of `is` Instead of `==`**\n","   ```python\n","   a = 10\n","   if a is 10:  # 'is' checks object identity, not value\n","       print(\"Value is 10\")\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** `is` should be used for identity comparison, not value comparison.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   if a == 10:  # Use '==' for value comparison\n","       print(\"Value is 10\")\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. Modifying a List While Iterating Over It**\n","   ```python\n","   nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","   for num in nums:\n","       if num % 2 == 0:\n","           nums.remove(num)  # Removing while iterating causes unexpected behavior\n","   print(nums)  # Unexpected Output: [1, 3, 5]\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** The loop skips elements when modifying the list.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version (Using List Comprehension or `filter`)**  \n","   ```python\n","   nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","   nums = [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]  # Removes even numbers correctly\n","   print(nums)  # Output: [1, 3, 5]\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Using `append()` Instead of `extend()`**\n","   ```python\n","   list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n","   list2 = [4, 5]\n","   list1.append(list2)  # Appends list as a single element\n","   print(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** `list2` is added as a sublist instead of merging elements.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n","   list2 = [4, 5]\n","   list1.extend(list2)  # Merges elements of list2 into list1\n","   print(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8. Returning Wrong Value in a Function**\n","   ```python\n","   def multiply(a, b):\n","       result = a + b  # Mistakenly using '+' instead of '*'\n","       return result\n","\n","   print(multiply(3, 4))  # Output: 7 (Incorrect)\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** Addition is used instead of multiplication.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   def multiply(a, b):\n","       result = a * b\n","       return result\n","\n","   print(multiply(3, 4))  # Output: 12\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **9. Default Argument Mutation in Functions**\n","   ```python\n","   def add_to_list(value, my_list=[]):\n","       my_list.append(value)\n","       return my_list\n","\n","   print(add_to_list(1))  # Output: [1]\n","   print(add_to_list(2))  # Output: [1, 2] (Unexpected)\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** The default mutable list persists between function calls.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   def add_to_list(value, my_list=None):\n","       if my_list is None:\n","           my_list = []\n","       my_list.append(value)\n","       return my_list\n","\n","   print(add_to_list(1))  # Output: [1]\n","   print(add_to_list(2))  # Output: [2]\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **10. Using `input()` Without Converting to Integer**\n","   ```python\n","   num = input(\"Enter a number: \")  \n","   print(num + 5)  # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n","   ```\n","   **Logical Error:** `input()` returns a string, so addition causes an error.\n","\n","   **Corrected Version:**  \n","   ```python\n","   num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))  # Convert input to integer\n","   print(num + 5)\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**\n","Logical errors won’t cause syntax errors but lead to **unexpected or incorrect results**.
