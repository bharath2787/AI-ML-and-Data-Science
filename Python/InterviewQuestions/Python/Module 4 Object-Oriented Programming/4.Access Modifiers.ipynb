What are access modifiers in Python?**\n","\n","Access modifiers control the visibility of class members. Python uses naming conventions:\n","\n","* Public: `var`\n","* Protected: `_var`\n","* Private: `__var`\n","\n","They guide access rather than enforce strict access control.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **32. How do you define a private variable in Python?**\n","\n","Prefix the variable with double underscores (`__`). This triggers name mangling, making it harder (but not impossible) to access from outside the class.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **33. What is the difference between `_var`, `__var`, and `__var__`?**\n","\n","* `_var`: Protected, by convention.\n","* `__var`: Private, triggers name mangling.\n","* `__var__`: Special (magic) method/attribute defined by Python (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **34. How does name mangling work?**\n","\n","Name mangling rewrites private attributes like `__value` to `_ClassName__value`, preventing accidental access but not absolute protection.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **35. Are private and protected truly enforced in Python?**\n","\n","No. Python relies on conventions, not strict enforcement. Name mangling discourages direct access but does not prevent it.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **36. Why does Python rely on naming conventions for access control?**\n","\n","Python follows a philosophy of “we are all consenting adults.” It trusts developers to respect conventions instead of enforcing strict access control.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **37. How can you access a private attribute from outside the class?**\n","\n","By using the mangled name: `_ClassName__attr`. Example:\n","\n","```python\n","obj._MyClass__private_var\n","```\n","\n","Though technically possible, it's discouraged.\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZNw3m5U1_cd-"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"e6VmZbdz_fDD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
