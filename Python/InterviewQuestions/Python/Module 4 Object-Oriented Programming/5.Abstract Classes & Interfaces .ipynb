What is an abstract class in Python?**\n","\n","An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define a common interface for its subclasses. It typically contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **39. How do you define an abstract class in Python?**\n","\n","Use the `abc` module:\n","\n","```python\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","class MyBase(ABC):\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def do_work(self):\n","        pass\n","```\n","\n","Any subclass must implement `do_work()` to be instantiable.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **40. What is the purpose of the `@abstractmethod` decorator?**\n","\n","`@abstractmethod` marks a method as abstract, meaning subclasses are required to override it. It enforces a contract for subclasses to implement specific behavior.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **41. Can an abstract class have concrete methods?**\n","\n","Yes. An abstract class can include both abstract and concrete (fully implemented) methods. This allows code reuse along with enforced method implementation in subclasses.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **42. What happens if a subclass doesn't implement all abstract methods?**\n","\n","The subclass itself becomes abstract and cannot be instantiated until it implements all abstract methods from its parent(s).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **43. How is an interface simulated in Python?**\n","\n","Python doesn't have formal interfaces. Instead, abstract base classes (ABCs) are used to simulate interfaces by defining abstract methods only, without implementation.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **44. When would you use an abstract class over a regular class?**\n","\n","Use an abstract class when you want to define a base class that should not be instantiated directly, and you want to enforce a common interface across multiple derived classes.\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"IThuv-HF-T3G"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"B01J4aiS-bbS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
