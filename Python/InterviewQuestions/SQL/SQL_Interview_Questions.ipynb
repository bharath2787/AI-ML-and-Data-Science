SQL Basics**\n","\n","1. **What is SQL, and what are its main uses?**\n","   SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It's used for querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records.\n","\n","2. **Difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?**\n","   `WHERE` filters rows before aggregation; `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation.\n","\n","3. **Difference between types of JOINs?**\n","\n","* `INNER JOIN`: Returns matching rows from both tables.\n","* `LEFT JOIN`: All rows from left + matching from right.\n","* `RIGHT JOIN`: All rows from right + matching from left.\n","* `FULL OUTER JOIN`: All rows from both sides with NULLs where no match.\n","\n","4. **What is a primary key?**\n","   A primary key uniquely identifies each record and doesn’t allow `NULL` or duplicates. Only one primary key per table.\n","\n","5. **What is a foreign key?**\n","   A foreign key links two tables and enforces referential integrity by referencing a primary key in another table.\n","\n","6. **`DISTINCT` vs `GROUP BY`?**\n","   `DISTINCT` removes duplicate rows. `GROUP BY` aggregates data based on column values.\n","\n","7. **What does `ORDER BY` do?**\n","   It sorts the result set. Default is ascending order (`ASC`), but can be reversed with `DESC`.\n","\n","8. **`NULL` vs 0 vs empty string?**\n","\n","* `NULL`: Unknown or missing.\n","* `0`: Numeric value.\n","* `''`: Known empty text.\n","\n","9. **Types of SQL commands?**\n","\n","* DDL: CREATE, ALTER\n","* DML: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE\n","* DCL: GRANT, REVOKE\n","* TCL: COMMIT, ROLLBACK\n","\n","10. **What is a Cartesian product?**\n","    It’s the result of a `CROSS JOIN`—every row from one table paired with every row from another.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **II. Aggregations & Grouping**\n","\n","11. **`COUNT(*)` vs `COUNT(column_name)`?**\n","    `COUNT(*)` counts all rows. `COUNT(column)` skips `NULL` values.\n","\n","12. **Average salary per department?**\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;\n","```\n","\n","13. **What does `HAVING` do?**\n","    Filters aggregated results—used after `GROUP BY`.\n","\n","14. **What does `GROUP BY` do?**\n","    Groups rows with the same values in specified columns so aggregate functions can be applied.\n","\n","15. **How to count unique values?**\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) FROM table;\n","```\n","\n","16. **`SUM()` vs `COUNT()`?**\n","    `SUM()` totals numeric values. `COUNT()` returns the number of rows or non-NULL values.\n","\n","17. **Group by multiple columns?**\n","\n","```sql\n","GROUP BY dept, location;\n","```\n","\n","Groups by unique combinations of both.\n","\n","18. **What is `ROLLUP` and `CUBE`?**\n","    They’re extensions to `GROUP BY` for multi-level aggregations. `ROLLUP` is hierarchical; `CUBE` covers all combinations.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **III. Joins & Relationships**\n","\n","19. **`JOIN` vs `UNION`?**\n","    `JOIN` combines columns from related tables; `UNION` stacks rows from two queries with the same columns.\n","\n","20. **Join three tables?**\n","    By chaining `JOIN`s:\n","\n","```sql\n","FROM A JOIN B ON ... JOIN C ON ...\n","```\n","\n","21. **What is a `SELF JOIN`?**\n","    A table joined to itself—for example, to find employees and their managers.\n","\n","22. **Example of many-to-many relationship?**\n","    Students and courses via a junction table like `enrollments(student_id, course_id)`.\n","\n","23. **What happens in a `LEFT JOIN` with no match?**\n","    Left table rows still appear; unmatched right-side columns return `NULL`.\n","\n","24. **`CROSS JOIN` vs `INNER JOIN`?**\n","    `CROSS JOIN` gives Cartesian product; `INNER JOIN` returns only matched rows.\n","\n","25. **Can you join a table to itself?**\n","    Yes, using table aliases—e.g., to get employee-manager pairs.\n","\n","26. **How do foreign keys relate to joins?**\n","    They define how rows in one table relate to another—used in join conditions.\n","\n","27. **Query for employee and manager names?**\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT e.name, m.name AS manager\n","FROM employees e\n","JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;\n","```\n","\n","28. **What is a natural join?**\n","    It joins tables based on columns with the same name and data type. Not recommended due to lack of control.\n","\n","29. **Impact of joining on non-indexed columns?**\n","    It slows down queries as full table scans may be required.\n","\n","30. **Return customers who made purchases?**\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT DISTINCT c.name\n","FROM customers c\n","JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **IV. Filtering, Sorting, Logic**\n","\n","31. **How to filter with `LIKE`?**\n","    Use `%` as a wildcard: `WHERE name LIKE 'A%'` finds names starting with A.\n","\n","32. **What is `BETWEEN`?**\n","    Filters values in a range: `WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25`.\n","\n","33. **What does `CASE` do?**\n","    Implements conditional logic.\n","\n","```sql\n","CASE WHEN score >= 90 THEN 'A' ELSE 'B' END\n","```\n","\n","34. **Categorize customers based on spend?**\n","    Use `CASE` with conditions on `SUM(purchase_amount)`.\n","\n","35. **How to get top N rows?**\n","    Use `LIMIT N` (MySQL/Postgres) or `TOP N` (SQL Server).\n","\n","36. **`IN` vs `EXISTS` vs `NOT IN`?**\n","\n","* `IN`: Checks membership.\n","* `EXISTS`: Faster for correlated subqueries.\n","* `NOT IN`: Returns rows not in a list, but can fail with `NULL`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **V. Subqueries**\n","\n","37. **What is a subquery?**\n","    A query inside another. Can be in `WHERE`, `FROM`, or `SELECT` clause.\n","\n","38. **Correlated vs non-correlated subqueries?**\n","\n","* Correlated depends on outer query row.\n","* Non-correlated runs independently.\n","\n","39. **Products priced above average?**\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT * FROM products\n","WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);\n","```\n","\n","40. **Employees earning above department average?**\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT e.*\n","FROM employees e\n","WHERE salary > (\n","  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e.department\n",");\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Sm1kYDMBw7yp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"80cHft3YxGxH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
