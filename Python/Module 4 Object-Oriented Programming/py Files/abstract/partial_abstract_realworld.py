Real-World Example: Payment System with Partial Abstraction
Letâ€™s consider a payment gateway system where:

The base class Payment defines a general process_payment() method (which can be common for all types of payments).
However, the detailed implementation of how the payment is processed (i.e., using credit cards, PayPal, etc.) is left to the subclasses.



Why Partial Abstraction?
Code Reusability: The base class can handle common operations for all types of payments, avoiding code duplication.
Flexibility: The subclasses are free to implement their own verification and execution logic specific to the payment method they handle.



Real-World Analogy:
Think of a restaurant system where the base class Order defines the steps for 
processing an order (e.g., take_order(), process_payment()). However, each 
type of order (dine-in, takeout, delivery) would have its own way of handling 
specifics like delivery charges, special instructions, etc.

This allows the system to keep a standard structure but provides customizability for different types of orders.
