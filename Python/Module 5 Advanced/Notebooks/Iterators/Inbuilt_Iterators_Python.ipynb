These iterators allow sequential access to data **without storing all elements in memory at once**.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **1️⃣ File Object Iterator (Reads Line by Line)**\n","🔹 **File objects in Python act as iterators, reading one line at a time instead of storing the entire file in memory.**  \n","\n","```python\n","with open(\"sample.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n","    for line in file:  # File object is an iterator\n","        print(line.strip())  # Reads one line at a time\n","```\n","✅ **Memory-efficient:** It does not load the full file into memory.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **2️⃣ `enumerate()` Iterator (Index + Value)**\n","🔹 `enumerate()` returns an iterator that **yields (index, value) pairs** for any iterable.  \n","\n","```python\n","fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","enum_iter = enumerate(fruits)  # Iterator\n","\n","print(next(enum_iter))  # Output: (0, 'apple')\n","print(next(enum_iter))  # Output: (1, 'banana')\n","```\n","✅ Useful when looping with **index tracking**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **3️⃣ `zip()` Iterator (Combining Multiple Iterables)**\n","🔹 `zip()` combines elements from multiple iterables **without storing the entire result**.\n","\n","```python\n","names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\n","ages = [25, 30, 35]\n","\n","zip_iter = zip(names, ages)  # Iterator\n","\n","print(next(zip_iter))  # Output: ('Alice', 25)\n","print(next(zip_iter))  # Output: ('Bob', 30)\n","```\n","✅ **Saves memory** by yielding one tuple at a time.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **4️⃣ `iter()` on a List (Manually Creating an Iterator)**\n","🔹 The `iter()` function converts an iterable (like a list) into an **explicit iterator**.\n","\n","```python\n","numbers = [10, 20, 30]\n","num_iter = iter(numbers)  # Creates an iterator\n","\n","print(next(num_iter))  # Output: 10\n","print(next(num_iter))  # Output: 20\n","```\n","✅ **Lists themselves are not iterators**, but `iter()` makes them one.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **5️⃣ `reversed()` Iterator (Iterates in Reverse)**\n","🔹 The `reversed()` function **returns an iterator** that goes through an iterable **in reverse order**.\n","\n","```python\n","nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","rev_iter = reversed(nums)  # Iterator\n","\n","print(next(rev_iter))  # Output: 4\n","print(next(rev_iter))  # Output: 3\n","```\n","✅ **No need to store a reversed copy in memory**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **6️⃣ `map()` Iterator (Applies Function Lazily)**\n","🔹 `map()` applies a function to each item **without creating a new list**.\n","\n","```python\n","nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","map_iter = map(lambda x: x * 2, nums)  # Iterator\n","\n","print(next(map_iter))  # Output: 2\n","print(next(map_iter))  # Output: 4\n","```\n","✅ **Efficient:** Only computes values when needed.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **7️⃣ `filter()` Iterator (Filters Elements on Demand)**\n","🔹 `filter()` returns an iterator that **yields only matching elements**.\n","\n","```python\n","nums = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]\n","filter_iter = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums)  # Iterator\n","\n","print(next(filter_iter))  # Output: 10\n","print(next(filter_iter))  # Output: 20\n","```\n","✅ **Does not store all filtered values**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **8️⃣ `range()` Iterator (Generates Numbers on Demand)**\n","🔹 `range()` produces numbers **lazily**, without storing them.\n","\n","```python\n","range_iter = iter(range(1, 4))  # Creates an iterator\n","\n","print(next(range_iter))  # Output: 1\n","print(next(range_iter))  # Output: 2\n","```\n","✅ **Much more memory-efficient than a list of numbers**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **🚀 Summary Table**\n","| **Built-in Iterator** | **Use Case** |\n","|----------------------|-------------|\n","| **File Object** | Reads a file line by line |\n","| **enumerate()** | Adds an index while looping |\n","| **zip()** | Combines multiple iterables |\n","| **iter()** | Converts an iterable into an iterator |\n","| **reversed()** | Iterates in reverse without copying |\n","| **map()** | Applies a function to each item lazily |\n","| **filter()** | Filters elements without storing results |\n","| **range()** | Generates numbers on demand |\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6A-6mls9G8Dt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"GLwor3cZG9FW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
