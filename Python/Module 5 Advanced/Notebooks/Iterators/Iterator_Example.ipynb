It is initialized to `start` (the starting value).\n","  - `self.end`: This is the end value up to which the iteration will continue. Once `self.current` reaches `self.end`, the iteration stops.\n","\n","### **2. `__iter__(self)`**\n","- This method is part of the **iterator protocol**. The `__iter__()` method must return an iterator object.\n","- Here, the iterator object is the object itself (`return self`), meaning the iterator is its own iterator. This is common for simple iterator classes where the class itself can manage the iteration.\n","\n","### **3. `__next__(self)`**\n","- The `__next__()` method is another required part of the **iterator protocol**. It is responsible for returning the next value in the sequence.\n","- **How it works**:\n","  - If `self.current` is less than `self.end`, it means there are still values to iterate over. So, it increments `self.current` by 1 and returns the previous value (`self.current - 1`).\n","  - Once `self.current` reaches `self.end`, it raises a `StopIteration` exception to signal that there are no more items to iterate over. This is crucial for ending the iteration in Python.\n","\n","### **4. Example usage:**\n","\n","```python\n","my_iter = MyIterator(0, 5)\n","for number in my_iter:\n","    print(number)\n","```\n","\n","In this example, `MyIterator(0, 5)` creates an iterator that starts at 0 and ends before 5. The `for` loop calls `__iter__()` to get the iterator and then repeatedly calls `__next__()` to get the next value until `StopIteration` is raised.\n","\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","0\n","1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","```\n","\n","### **Summary**:\n","- The iterator starts at `start` (0) and stops when it reaches `end` (5).\n","- The `__iter__()` method makes the object iterable (it returns itself as an iterator).\n","- The `__next__()` method handles the iteration logic, incrementing the current value and stopping when the end is reached by raising a `StopIteration` exception.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CG3cVCw7AbYO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"-uRIxDsGGrFe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"ln9atz7UAfey"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
