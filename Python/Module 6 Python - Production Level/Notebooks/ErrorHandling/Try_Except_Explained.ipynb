Here are some different scenarios where `try-except` is useful:\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **1. Handling a Single Exception**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    x = 10 / 0  # Division by zero\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"You cannot divide by zero!\")\n","```\n","**Output:**  \n","```\n","You cannot divide by zero!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **2. Handling Multiple Exceptions Separately**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    num = int(\"hello\")  # Invalid conversion\n","except ValueError:\n","    print(\"Invalid input! Cannot convert to integer.\")\n","except TypeError:\n","    print(\"Type error occurred!\")\n","```\n","**Output:**  \n","```\n","Invalid input! Cannot convert to integer.\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **3. Handling Multiple Exceptions in One Block**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","    print(my_list[5])  # IndexError\n","except (IndexError, KeyError):\n","    print(\"Either an IndexError or KeyError occurred!\")\n","```\n","**Output:**  \n","```\n","Either an IndexError or KeyError occurred!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **4. Using `else` with `try-except`**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 2\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Division successful, result:\", result)\n","```\n","**Output:**  \n","```\n","Division successful, result: 5.0\n","```\n","ðŸ“Œ The `else` block runs if no exceptions occur.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **5. Using `finally` to Clean Up Resources**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    file = open(\"sample.txt\", \"r\")\n","    content = file.read()\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    print(\"File not found!\")\n","finally:\n","    print(\"This will always execute, whether an exception occurs or not.\")\n","```\n","**Output:**  \n","```\n","File not found!\n","This will always execute, whether an exception occurs or not.\n","```\n","ðŸ“Œ The `finally` block runs **no matter what**, even if an exception occurs.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **6. Catching and Printing Exception Details**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    x = int(\"abc\")\n","except ValueError as e:\n","    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n","```\n","**Output:**  \n","```\n","An error occurred: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'\n","```\n","ðŸ“Œ Using `as e` captures the exception message.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **7. Raising a Custom Exception**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    age = -5\n","    if age < 0:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative!\")\n","except ValueError as e:\n","    print(e)\n","```\n","**Output:**  \n","```\n","Age cannot be negative!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **8. Using `try-except` in a Loop**\n","```python\n","while True:\n","    try:\n","        num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n","        break  # If valid input, break the loop\n","    except ValueError:\n","        print(\"Invalid input!

Nested `try-except` Blocks**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    num1 = int(input(\"Enter numerator: \"))\n","    num2 = int(input(\"Enter denominator: \"))\n","\n","    try:\n","        result = num1 / num2\n","        print(\"Result:\", result)\n","    except ZeroDivisionError:\n","        print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n","except ValueError:\n","    print(\"Invalid input!
