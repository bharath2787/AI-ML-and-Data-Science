for.\n","\n","---\n","\n","```python\n","index = new[new['title'] == movie].index[0]\n","```\n","\n","* This line finds the **row index** of the movie in the dataset `new` where the title matches the given `movie` name.\n","* `new['title'] == movie` creates a boolean filter.\n","* `.index[0]` extracts the first matching index.\n","* This index will be used to look up similarity scores for that movie.\n","\n","---\n","\n","```python\n","distances = sorted(list(enumerate(similarity[index])), reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[1])\n","```\n","\n","* `similarity` is a matrix where each row corresponds to a movie, and each column contains similarity scores between that movie and every other movie.\n","* `similarity[index]` gives the similarity scores of the input movie with all other movies.\n","* `enumerate()` pairs each similarity score with its movie index, creating tuples like `(movie_index, similarity_score)`.\n","* `list()` converts the enumerate object into a list of tuples.\n","* `sorted(..., reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[1])` sorts this list **in descending order** by the similarity score (`x[1]`), so the most similar movies come first.\n","\n","---\n","\n","```python\n","for i in distances[1:6]:\n","    print(new.iloc[i[0]].title)\n","```\n","\n","* `distances[1:6]` slices the sorted list to get the **top 5 movies** after the first one.\n","* We skip the first element `distances[0]` because that is the movie itself (with similarity = 1).\n","* The loop goes through these 5 most similar movies.\n","* `new.iloc[i[0]].title` fetches the title of the movie using the index `i[0]` from the original dataframe.\n","* `print()` displays the recommended movie titles.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Summary:\n","\n","* You give the function a movie name.\n","* It finds the similarity scores of that movie with all others.\n","* It sorts the movies by similarity score, highest first.\n","* It prints the top 5 similar movie titles
