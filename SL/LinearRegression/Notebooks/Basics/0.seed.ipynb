Let me explain what this means and why it's useful with an example.\n","\n","### What is `np.random.seed()`?\n","\n","- **`np.random.seed()`**: This function sets the seed for NumPy's random number generator. The seed is a starting point for the sequence of random numbers. When you set a seed, you ensure that the sequence of random numbers generated is the same every time you run your code, which is crucial for reproducibility.\n","\n","- **Why 42?**: The number `42` is just an example and is often used as a joke in programming because of its reference in *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* as \"the answer to life, the universe, and everything.\" You can use any integer as the seed value.\n","\n","### Why Use a Seed?\n","- **Reproducibility**: When working with randomness (e.g., in simulations, random sampling, or machine learning), it's often important to get the same results every time you run the code. By setting a seed, you ensure that others (or even you, at a later time) can reproduce the exact same sequence of \"random\" numbers.\n","\n","### Example:\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rfKyMiJ7Vb6H"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Set the random seed\n","np.random.seed(42)\n","\n","# Generate a random array\n","random_numbers = np.random.rand(5)\n","\n","print(random_numbers)\n","\n","# Output will be :\n","# [0.37454012 0.95071431 0.73199394 0.59865848 0.15601864]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DeK7CURbVmMl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724140158852,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1065,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}},"outputId":"c1741473-d7b5-4b7a-ecd5-cb90170993a7"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[0.37454012 0.95071431 0.73199394 0.59865848 0.15601864]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","### Explanation:\n","\n","1. **Setting the Seed**: The line `np.random.seed(42)` sets the random seed to `42`.
