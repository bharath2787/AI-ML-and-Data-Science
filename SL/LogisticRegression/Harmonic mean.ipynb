Unlike the arithmetic mean (the regular average), which sums up all the numbers and divides by the count, the harmonic mean is particularly useful in situations where rates are involved or where we want to average ratios.\n","\n","### Harmonic Mean Formula\n","\n","For a set of \\( n \\) numbers \\( x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n \\), the harmonic mean (HM) is defined as:\n","\n","$[\n","\\text{Harmonic Mean} = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{x_i}}\n","]$\n","\n","### Example of Harmonic Mean Calculation\n","\n","Suppose you have three values: 2, 3, and 6. The harmonic mean is calculated as follows:\n","\n","$[\n","\\text{HM} = \\frac{3}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{\\left(0.5 + 0.333 + 0.167\\right)} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\n","]$\n","\n","### Difference Between Harmonic Mean and Arithmetic Mean\n","\n","1. **Arithmetic Mean**:\n","   - The arithmetic mean (AM) is what we typically refer to as the \"average.\" It's calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count.\n","   - **Formula**:\n","     $[\n","     \\text{Arithmetic Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\n","     ]$\n","   - **Example**: For the same set of values (2, 3, and 6):\n","     $[\n","     \\text{AM} = \\frac{2 + 3 + 6}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\approx 3.67\n","     ]$\n","\n","2. **Harmonic Mean**:\n","   - The harmonic mean is more appropriate than the arithmetic mean when dealing with averages of rates or ratios, especially when the values have significant differences. It tends to give more weight to smaller numbers.\n","   - **Example**: The harmonic mean of 2, 3, and 6 is 3, as calculated earlier, which is lower than the arithmetic mean.\n","\n","### When to Use the Harmonic Mean\n","\n","- **Rates and Ratios**: The harmonic mean is ideal when averaging things like speeds, rates, or ratios. For example, if you're averaging speeds (e.g., miles per hour), the harmonic mean gives a better sense of the overall rate than the arithmetic mean.\n","  \n","- **F1 Score**: The F1 score, as discussed earlier, uses the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall because it balances the two metrics, ensuring that a model with one high and one low value doesn't score disproportionately well.\n","\n","### Summary\n","\n","- **Arithmetic Mean** is the \"regular\" average, suitable for most contexts where you're dealing with sums.\n","- **Harmonic Mean** is more appropriate when averaging rates, ratios, or other quantities where the smaller numbers should be given more influence.\n","- The harmonic mean will always be less than or equal to the arithmetic mean, and it gives a better measure when there's a large disparity among the numbers in the set."],"metadata":{"id":"9TfkoC_N33MY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"NRvmY2Ho33wt"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
