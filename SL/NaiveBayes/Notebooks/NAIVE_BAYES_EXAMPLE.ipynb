The dataset includes the following features: **Outlook** (Sunny, Overcast, Rainy), **Temperature** (Hot, Mild, Cool), **Humidity** (High, Normal), and **Windy** (True, False). The target variable is whether golf was played (Yes or No).\n","\n","#### Sample Dataset\n","\n","| Outlook  | Temperature | Humidity | Windy | Play Golf |\n","|----------|-------------|----------|-------|-----------|\n","| Sunny    | Hot         | High     | False | No        |\n","| Sunny    | Hot         | High     | True  | No        |\n","| Overcast | Hot         | High     | False | Yes       |\n","| Rainy    | Mild        | High     | False | Yes       |\n","| Rainy    | Cool        | Normal   | False | Yes       |\n","| Rainy    | Cool        | Normal   | True  | No        |\n","| Overcast | Cool        | Normal   | True  | Yes       |\n","| Sunny    | Mild        | High     | False | No        |\n","| Sunny    | Mild        | Normal   | True  | Yes       |\n","| Rainy    | Mild        | Normal   | False | Yes       |\n","| Overcast | Mild        | High     | True  | Yes       |\n","| Overcast | Hot         | Normal   | False | Yes       |\n","| Rainy    | Mild        | High     | True  | No        |\n","\n","### Step 1: Calculate Prior Probabilities\n","\n","First, we calculate the prior probabilities for the target variable (Play Golf):\n","\n","- **Total instances**: 14\n","- **Play Golf = Yes**: 9 instances\n","- **Play Golf = No**: 5 instances\n","\n","The prior probabilities are:\n","\n","$$\n","P(Yes) = \\frac{9}{14} \\approx 0.643\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","P(No) = \\frac{5}{14} \\approx 0.357\n","$$\n","\n","### Step 2: Calculate Likelihoods\n","\n","Next, we calculate the likelihood of each feature given the target variable. For example, if we want to predict whether golf will be played on a **Sunny** day with **High** humidity:\n","\n","- **P(Sunny | Yes)**: Out of 9 instances where golf was played, 2 were Sunny.\n","\n","$$\n","P(Sunny | Yes) = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 0.222\n","$$\n","\n","- **P(High | Yes)**: Out of 9 instances where golf was played, 3 had High humidity.\n","\n","$$\n","P(High | Yes) = \\frac{3}{9} \\approx 0.333\n","$$\n","\n","- Similarly, we calculate for the No class:\n","\n","$$\n","P(Sunny | No) = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.600\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","P(High | No) = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.400\n","$$\n","\n","### Step 3: Apply Naive Bayes Formula\n","\n","Now, we can use the Naive Bayes formula to predict whether golf will be played given that it is Sunny and Humid:\n","\n","$$\n","P(Yes | Sunny, High) = \\frac{P(Sunny | Yes) \\times P(High | Yes) \\times P(Yes)}{P(Sunny, High)}\n","$$\n","\n","Since $$ P(Sunny, High) $$ is a constant for our calculation, we can ignore it for comparison purposes.
