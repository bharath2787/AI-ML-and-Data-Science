specifying a fixed grid of hyperparameters like in `GridSearchCV`, we define a distribution or list from which random values will be sampled.\n","   - `uniform`: This represents a continuous uniform distribution. For example, `uniform(0.1, 100)` samples a random float between 0.1 and 100.\n","   - `randint`: This represents a discrete uniform distribution. For example, `randint(2, 5)` samples an integer between 2 and 4.\n","\n","2. **n_iter:**\n","   - This parameter specifies the number of parameter settings that are sampled. For example, `n_iter=50` means that 50 random combinations will be evaluated.\n","\n","3. **Random State:**\n","   - `random_state=42` ensures that the random sampling is reproducible.\n","\n","4. **best_params_ and best_score_:**\n","   - `best_params_` gives the best set of hyperparameters found by the search.\n","   - `best_score_` is the best cross-validation score achieved by those hyperparameters.\n","\n","5. **Test Set Evaluation:**\n","   - After finding the best model using `RandomizedSearchCV`, we evaluate its performance on the test set to ensure it generalizes well.\n","\n","### When to Use GridSearchCV vs. RandomizedSearchCV:\n","\n","- **GridSearchCV**: Use when you have a relatively small hyperparameter space and want to test all combinations exhaustively.\n","- **RandomizedSearchCV**: Use when the hyperparameter space is large, and you want to explore a broad range of values with a fixed computational budget.\n","\n","### Advantages of RandomizedSearchCV:\n","\n","- **Efficiency**: Faster when searching large hyperparameter spaces.\n","- **Flexibility**: Allows using distributions for hyperparameters, enabling the exploration of a wider range of values.\n","\n","In practice, `RandomizedSearchCV` can often find good or even optimal hyperparameter settings with much less computational effort than `GridSearchCV`."],"metadata":{"id":"e0zmUWmTdkzm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"uBe6KivsdlLL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738303148123,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]}]}
