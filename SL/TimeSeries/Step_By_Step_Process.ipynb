Visual Inspection**\n","- Plot the original time series.\n","- Plot **rolling mean** and **rolling standard deviation** to check for trend and variance changes.\n","- Use `rolling(window).mean()` and `.std()`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test**\n","- Statistically check for stationarity.\n","- If **p-value > 0.05**, the series is **non-stationary**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Apply Transformations (if needed)**\n","To **stabilize variance**:\n","- **Log Transformation**: `np.log(data)`\n","- **Square root or Box-Cox Transform** (for skewed data)\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Differencing**\n","To **remove trend** and **cyclic components**:\n","- **First-order differencing**: `data.diff().dropna()`\n","- If still non-stationary, apply:\n","  - **Second-order differencing**: `data.diff().diff().dropna()`\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Seasonal Differencing (if seasonality exists)**\n","- Subtract value from the same season last period:\n","  ```python\n","  data.diff(period).dropna()\n","  ```\n","  Example: For monthly data with yearly seasonality → `data.diff(12)`\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. Recheck Stationarity**\n","- Plot the transformed series.\n","- Run the ADF test again.\n","- If **ADF p-value ≤ 0.05** and plots look stable → **Series is stationary**\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. (Optional) Decomposition**\n","To see components:\n","```python\n","from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose\n","decompose_result = seasonal_decompose(data, model='additive')\n","decompose_result.plot()\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8.Determine AR(pacf), MA(acf) values using ACF and PACF plots**\n","\n","----\n","\n","\n","### **9.Build Model**\n","\n","----\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"b0RO0LQjUruE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Hqv5RlJtUsxS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
