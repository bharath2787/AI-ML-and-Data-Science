 What is a CROSS JOIN?\n","\n","A **CROSS JOIN** returns the **Cartesian product** of two tables — it combines **every row from the first table** with **every row from the second table**.\n","\n","A Cartesian Product (also called a Cross Join) occurs when you join every row of one table with every row of another table, without any join condition.\n","\n",">  If Table A has `m` rows and Table B has `n` rows, the result of a `CROSS JOIN` will have `m * n` rows.\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  Syntax:\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT *\n","FROM table1\n","CROSS JOIN table2;\n","```\n","\n","or (without the keyword):\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT *\n","FROM table1, table2;\n","```\n","\n","Both yield the same result — but `CROSS JOIN` is more explicit and readable.\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  Example using our `sql_hr` database:\n","\n","### Tables:\n","\n","* `employees` (let’s say it has 5 rows)\n","* `offices` (let’s say it has 3 rows)\n","\n","### Query:\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, o.city, o.state\n","FROM employees e\n","CROSS JOIN offices o;\n","```\n","\n","###  What happens:\n","\n","Each employee will be paired with **every office**.\n","So if there are 5 employees and 3 offices, the result will have **5 × 3 = 15 rows**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  When to Use CROSS JOIN?\n","\n","* To **generate combinations** of two sets (like pairing all products with all customers)\n","* Useful in **test scenarios**, **matrix calculations**, or **pivot table-like reports**\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  Note:\n","\n","* **No condition or ON clause** is used in a CROSS JOIN.\n","* Be cautious on large datasets — the result size grows rapidly!\n","\n","Would you like a visual diagram or sample output as
