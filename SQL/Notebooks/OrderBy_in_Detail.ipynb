By default, it sorts in **ascending order** (`ASC`). You can also sort in **descending order** (`DESC`). Sorting can be done by one or more columns, including **expressions**, **aliases**, and **positions**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Syntax:\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT column1, column2, ...\n","FROM table_name\n","ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC], ...;\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Examples using `products` Table\n","\n","Assume this structure:\n","\n","| Column     | Description         |\n","| ---------- | ------------------- |\n","| `name`     | Product name        |\n","| `price`    | Product price       |\n","| `discount` | Discount percentage |\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 1. **Sort by One Column**\n","\n","#### Sort by `price` in ascending order (default)\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, price\n","FROM products\n","ORDER BY price;\n","```\n","\n","#### Sort by `price` in descending order\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, price\n","FROM products\n","ORDER BY price DESC;\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. **Sort by Multiple Columns**\n","\n","Sort by `discount` first, then `price` (both ascending):\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, discount, price\n","FROM products\n","ORDER BY discount, price;\n","```\n","\n","Sort by `discount` descending, then `price` ascending:\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, discount, price\n","FROM products\n","ORDER BY discount DESC, price ASC;\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. **Sort by Column Position**\n","\n","In this case, the position refers to the columnâ€™s order in the `SELECT` clause:\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, discount, price\n","FROM products\n","ORDER BY 2 DESC; -- Sort by discount\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. **Sort by Expression**\n","\n","Sort by discounted price (price - discount):\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, price, discount, (price - discount) AS final_price\n","FROM products\n","ORDER BY final_price;\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. **Sort by Alias**\n","\n","You can use the alias defined in the `SELECT` clause to sort:\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, price, discount, (price - discount) AS net_price\n","FROM products\n","ORDER BY net_price DESC;\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. **Combining with WHERE**\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT name, price\n","FROM products\n","WHERE price > 1000\n","ORDER BY price DESC;\n","```\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RrknaY-gHgfI"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"pCiI5yUXHrNh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
