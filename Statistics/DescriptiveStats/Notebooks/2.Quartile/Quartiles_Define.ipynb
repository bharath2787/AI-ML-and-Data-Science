Each quartile represents a specific percentile in the dataset, allowing for a better understanding of how the data is distributed around the median.\n","\n","## Definition of Quartiles\n","\n","There are three quartiles in a dataset:\n","\n","- **First Quartile (Q1)**: This is the value below which 25% of the data falls. It represents the lower 25% of the dataset.\n","\n","- **Second Quartile (Q2)**: This is the median of the dataset, dividing it into two equal halves. It is the value below which 50% of the data falls.\n","\n","- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: This is the value below which 75% of the data falls, representing the upper 25% of the dataset.\n","\n","The quartiles are calculated after sorting the data in ascending order. The formulas to find the positions of the quartiles in a dataset with $ n $ items are:\n","\n","- $ Q1 = \\left(\\frac{n+1}{4}\\right) $th item\n","- $ Q2 = \\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right) $th item\n","- $ Q3 = \\left(\\frac{3(n+1)}{4}\\right) $th item.\n","\n","## Interquartile Range (IQR)\n","\n","The **Interquartile Range (IQR)** is a measure of statistical dispersion that describes the range within which the central 50% of the data lies. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1\n","$$\n","\n","The IQR is particularly useful for identifying outliers and understanding the variability of the dataset. A larger IQR indicates a wider spread of the middle 50% of the data, while a smaller IQR suggests that the data points are closer to each other.\n","\n","### Importance of Quartiles and IQR\n","\n","- **Data Distribution**: Quartiles provide a summary of the data distribution, allowing for comparisons between different datasets.\n","\n","- **Outlier Detection**: The IQR can be used to detect outliers. A common rule is that any data point below $ Q1 - 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR} $ or above $ Q3 + 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR} $ is considered an outlier.\n","\n","- **Box Plots**: Quartiles are often visualized using box plots, which graphically represent the median, quartiles, and potential outliers, making it easier to analyze the data's distribution.\n","\n","In summary, quartiles and the interquartile range are essential tools in statistics for understanding data distribution, variability, and identifying outliers.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6oWOAUTxbBXv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import necessary libraries\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Sample data\n","data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NjsqHbz-bClV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721799576011,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":682,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Number of data points\n","n = len(data)\n","n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"A7Pd_CS_P-OT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721799587674,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":458,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}},"outputId":"c625aabc-1261-49ac-c4ed-df11addd63bf"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["10"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Calculate quartile positions\n","Q1_pos = (n + 1) / 4\n","Q2_pos = (n + 1) / 2\n","Q3_pos = 3 * (n + 1) / 4\n"],"metadata":{"id":"37Q8yROOgrSj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721799598078,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":430,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Q1_pos, Q2_pos, Q3_pos"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DSJxOOMWQPx0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721799626178,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":450,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}},"outputId":"8cd26843-bad6-46aa-ccc7-3f0b2646f1ef"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(2.75, 5.5, 8.25)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Calculate quartiles manually\n","def interpolate(position, data):\n","    \"\"\"Interpolate the value at a given position\"\"\"\n","    lower_index = int(position) -
