It involves investigating the data to understand its structure, main characteristics, and to uncover any patterns, anomalies, or insights. Here’s a detailed guide on how to perform EDA:\n","\n","### Steps in EDA:\n","\n","1. **Understand the Data**:\n","    - **Data Collection**: Gather the data from various sources (databases, CSV files, APIs, etc.).\n","    - **Data Description**: Understand what each column represents and the type of data it holds.\n","    - **Data Type Correction**: correct the datatypes of any of the columns if required\n","\n","2. **Data Cleaning**:\n","    - **Data Type Correction**: Ensure all columns have the correct data types (e.g., numeric, categorical).\n","    - **Handling Missing Values**: Identify missing values and decide whether to remove them or impute them.\n","    - **Removing Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.\n","    \n","\n","\n","3. **Univariate Analysis**:\n","    - **Summary Statistics**: Use `describe()` method in pandas to get a summary of the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution.\n","    - **Distribution Plots**: Use histograms, box plots, and KDE plots to visualize the distribution of individual variables.\n","\n","4. **Bivariate Analysis**:\n","    - **Correlation**: Use correlation matrices and heatmaps to understand the relationships between different variables.\n","    - **Scatter Plots**: Visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.\n","    - **Bar Plots**: Use for comparing categorical data.\n","\n","5. **Multivariate Analysis**:\n","    - **Pair Plots**: Use pair plots to visualize relationships between multiple variables.\n","    - **Pivot Tables**: Summarize data by multiple variables.\n","\n","6. **Identifying Outliers**:\n","    - **Box Plots**: Use box plots to detect outliers.\n","    - **Z-Score / IQR Method**: Apply statistical methods to identify and handle outliers.\n","\n","7. **Feature Engineering**:\n","    - **Creating New Features**: Create new features from existing ones to help improve the performance of models.\n","    - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.\n","\n","8. **Visualization**:\n","    - Use various visualization techniques to represent data and findings. Common tools include Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for Python.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"B9lBUcXUJo6g"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"tpRQGfxqJw7n"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
