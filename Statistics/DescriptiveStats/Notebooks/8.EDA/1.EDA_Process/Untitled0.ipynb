Purpose: Shows the distribution of the numerical data.\n","   - When to use: When you want to see the frequency distribution of a single numerical variable.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     df['numerical_column'].hist()\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Boxplot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)**:\n","   - Purpose: Displays the spread and summary statistics of the data (median, quartiles, and outliers).\n","   - When to use: When you want to detect outliers and get a sense of the spread of the data.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     sns.boxplot(x=df['numerical_column'])\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Violin Plot**:\n","   - Purpose: Similar to a boxplot, but shows the probability distribution of the data.\n","   - When to use: When you want a more detailed view of the distribution of numerical data, especially for skewed distributions.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     sns.violinplot(x=df['numerical_column'])\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **Density Plot (Kernel Density Estimate, KDE)**:\n","   - Purpose: A smoothed version of the histogram that shows the distribution of the data.\n","   - When to use: When you want to observe the distribution more smoothly, particularly if the data is continuous.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     sns.kdeplot(df['numerical_column'])\n","     ```\n","\n","5. **QQ Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)**:\n","   - Purpose: Compares the distribution of the data with a theoretical distribution (e.g., normal).\n","   - When to use: When you want to check if the data follows a normal distribution.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     from scipy import stats\n","     stats.probplot(df['numerical_column'], dist=\"norm\", plot=plt)\n","     ```\n","\n","### **For Categorical Columns:**\n","1. **Bar Plot**:\n","   - Purpose: Shows the count or proportion of each category in a categorical column.\n","   - When to use: When you want to see the frequency of each category.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     sns.barplot(x=df['categorical_column'].value_counts().index, y=df['categorical_column'].value_counts().values)\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Count Plot**:\n","   - Purpose: A specific type of bar plot that automatically counts the occurrences of each category in a categorical variable.\n","   - When to use: When you want to quickly visualize the distribution of categories.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     sns.countplot(x=df['categorical_column'])\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Pie Chart**:\n","   - Purpose: Shows the proportion of each category as a percentage of the whole.\n","   - When to use: When you want to visualize the relative proportions of categories.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     df['categorical_column'].value_counts().plot.pie(autopct='%1.1f%%')\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **Heatmap of Categorical Data**:\n","   - Purpose: Shows the relationship between two categorical columns (contingency table).\n","   - When to use: When you want to observe patterns or correlations between two categorical variables.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     cross_tab = pd.crosstab(df['category1'], df['category2'])\n","     sns.heatmap(cross_tab, annot=True, cmap=\"Blues\", fmt=\"d\")\n","     ```\n","\n","5. **Boxplot (for categorical vs. numerical)**:\n","   - Purpose: Compares numerical data across different categories.\n","   - When to use: When you want to compare distributions of a numerical column across different categories.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     sns.boxplot(x=df['categorical_column'], y=df['numerical_column'])\n","     ```\n","\n","### **Combination of Numerical and Categorical:**\n","- **Facet Grid / Pair Grid**: When you want to explore relationships across multiple numerical or categorical columns.\n","  ```python\n","  g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col=\"categorical_column\")\n","  g.map(sns.histplot, \"numerical_column\")\n","  ```\n","\n","### Summary Table:\n","| Column Type     | Plot Type                                  | Purpose                                               |\n","|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n","| **Numerical**   | Histogram                                  | Distribution of data                                  |\n","| **Numerical**   | Boxplot                                    | Spread, quartiles, and outliers                       |\n","| **Numerical**   | Violin Plot                                | Distribution with density estimation                  |\n","| **Numerical**   | KDE Plot                                   | Smooth distribution curve                             |\n","| **Numerical**   | QQ Plot                                    | Compare distribution to normal                        |\n","| **Categorical** | Bar Plot                                   | Frequency of categories                               |\n","| **Categorical** | Count Plot                                 | Count of categories                                   |\n","| **Categorical** | Pie Chart                                  | Proportion of categories                              |\n","| **Categorical** | Heatmap (for two categorical variables)    | Relationship between two categorical variables        |\n","| **Numerical vs Categorical** | Boxplot                           | Compare numerical data across categories              |\n","\n","These plots will give you a comprehensive understanding of the data's distribution and the relationships between features."],"metadata":{"id":"fHVWOyRCMkO-"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"2W60H4R8Mkhu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Got it!
