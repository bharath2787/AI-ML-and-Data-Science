`pd.read_csv()` - Load the dataset.\n","  - `.head()` - View the first few rows of the data.\n","  - `.info()` - Understand the structure of the data, data types, and missing values.\n","  - `.describe()` - Get summary statistics for numerical columns.\n","  - `.shape` - Check the number of rows and columns.\n","  - `.columns` - List the column names.\n","- **Justification**: These methods provide a quick overview of the dataset, helping us understand its structure and potential issues like missing values.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 2: Data Cleaning\n","- **Pandas Methods to Use**:\n","  - `.isnull().sum()` - Identify missing values in each column.\n","  - `.dropna()` or `.fillna()` - Handle missing values appropriately.\n","  - `.duplicated()` and `.drop_duplicates()` - Check and remove duplicates if any.\n","  - `.astype()` - Convert columns to appropriate data types if necessary.\n","  - Handle outliers if needed:\n","    - `.quantile()` for detecting outliers using IQR.\n","    - `.clip()` to handle extreme values.\n","- **Justification**: Ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis by addressing missing or erroneous data points.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 3: Univariate Analysis\n","#### Numerical Columns\n","1. **Age**:\n","   - **Plots**: Histogram (`sns.histplot`), Boxplot (`sns.boxplot`).\n","   - **Justification**:\n","     - Histogram shows the distribution of age values and identifies central tendencies (e.g., average age).\n","     - Boxplot highlights outliers and age range.\n","2. **Income**:\n","   - **Plots**: Histogram, Boxplot.\n","   - **Justification**:\n","     - Histogram visualizes income spread and skewness.\n","     - Boxplot identifies extreme income values (e.g., outliers).\n","3. **Miles**:\n","   - **Plots**: Histogram, Boxplot.\n","   - **Justification**:\n","     - Histogram helps understand the frequency distribution of miles usage.\n","     - Boxplot highlights unusually high or low miles.\n","4. **Weight** (if applicable):\n","   - **Plots**: Histogram.\n","   - **Justification**: Shows weight distribution.\n","\n","#### Categorical Columns\n","1. **Gender**:\n","   -

**Product vs. Weight** (if applicable):\n","     - **Plot**: Boxplot.\n","     - **Justification**: Examines variations in weight distributions across products.\n","\n","2. **Categorical vs. Categorical**:\n","   - **Product vs. Gender**:\n","     - **Plot**: Stacked bar chart (`pd.crosstab`).\n","     - **Justification**: Shows gender preferences for each product.\n","   - **Product vs. Education**:\n","     - **Plot**: Stacked bar chart.\n","     - **Justification**: Helps analyze product preferences by education level.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Other Bivariate Analyses\n","1. **Numerical vs. Numerical**:\n","   - **Income vs. Age**:\n","     - **Plot**: Scatter plot (`sns.scatterplot`).\n","     - **Justification**: Identifies trends (e.g., whether income increases with age).\n","   - **Miles vs. Age**:\n","     - **Plot**: Scatter plot.\n","     - **Justification**: Shows if older users use the product less frequently.\n","   - **Miles vs. Income**:\n","     - **Plot**: Scatter plot.\n","     - **Justification**: Explores correlation between income and product usage.\n","   - **Correlation Matrix**:\n","     - **Plot**: Heatmap (`sns.heatmap`).\n","     - **Justification**: Identifies strong or weak correlations between numerical variables.\n","\n","2. **Numerical vs. Categorical**:\n","   - **Income vs. Gender**:\n","     - **Plot**: Boxplot.\n","     - **Justification**: Highlights income disparities between genders.\n","   - **Miles vs. Education**:\n","     - **Plot**: Boxplot.\n","     -
