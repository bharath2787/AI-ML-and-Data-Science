This dataset is often employed in classification tasks, aiming to predict passenger survival based on various attributes.\n","\n","### Key Features of the Titanic Dataset:\n","\n","1. **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.\n","2. **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) indicating whether the passenger survived the disaster.\n","3. **Pclass**: Passenger's class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd), which serves as a proxy for socio-economic status.\n","4. **Name**: Full name of the passenger, which can be used to extract titles and infer family relations.\n","5. **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (male or female).\n","6. **Age**: Age of the passenger in years. Some values may be missing and require imputation.\n","7. **SibSp**: Number of siblings and spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.\n","8. **Parch**: Number of parents and children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.\n","9. **Ticket**: Ticket number, which can provide insights into the socio-economic status and travel groupings.\n","10. **Fare**: Amount of money the passenger paid for the ticket, which also indicates socio-economic status.\n","11. **Cabin**: Cabin number, which can be used to deduce the passenger's location on the ship. This field has many missing values.\n","12. **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton), indicating the port where the passenger boarded the ship.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uPwlEvzt7wiH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"wrwlCNga8A5W"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","### Problem Statement\n","\n","**Objective:**\n","Conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that help in understanding the factors influencing passenger survival.\n","\n","**Goals:**\n","1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**\n","   - Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.\n","   - Convert categorical features to appropriate numerical formats if necessary.\n","   - Create new features (feature engineering) that may provide additional insights.\n","\n","2. **Descriptive Statistics and Visualization:**\n","   - Summarize the dataset using descriptive statistics to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of features.\n","   - Visualize the distribution of key features such as Age, Fare, and Pclass.\n","   - Visualize the relationship between different features and survival rate using plots such as bar charts, histograms, and box plots.\n","\n","3. **Univariate Analysis:**\n","   - Analyze individual features to understand their distribution and characteristics.\n","   - Identify any outliers and decide on appropriate treatments.\n","\n","4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:**\n","   - Examine the relationships between pairs of features and their combined influence on survival.\n","   - Use heatmaps, pair plots, and correlation matrices to visualize these relationships.\n","\n","5. **Segmentation and Patterns:**\n","   - Segment the data based on features such as Pclass, Sex, Age, and Embarked to uncover patterns in survival rates.\n","   - Identify any significant differences in survival rates across different passenger groups.\n","\n","6. **Insights and Conclusions:**\n","   - Summarize the key findings from the analysis.\n","   - Draw conclusions about the factors that most strongly influenced survival on the Titanic.\n","   - Discuss any limitations of the dataset and the analysis.\n","\n","### Deliverables:\n","- A detailed report or Jupyter notebook containing:\n","  - Steps of data cleaning and preparation.\n","  - Descriptive statistics and visualizations.\n","  - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.\n","  - Key insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis.\n","\n","### Example Questions to Explore:\n","- How does the survival rate vary with passenger class (Pclass)?\n","- What is the age distribution of the passengers, and how does age relate to survival?\n","- Are there differences in survival rates between males and females?\n","- How does the number of siblings/spouses (SibSp) or parents/children (Parch) aboard affect survival?\n","- Does the port of embarkation (Embarked) influence the chances of survival?\n","- How does the fare paid by passengers correlate with their survival?\n","\n","### Learning Outcomes:\n","- Gain proficiency in handling and cleaning real-world data.\n","- Develop skills in using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data.\n","- Learn to identify and analyze relationships between features.\n","- Practice drawing meaningful insights and conclusions from data analysis.\n","\n","This problem statement provides a clear framework for conducting EDA on the Titanic dataset, ensuring that students can systematically explore and analyze the data to derive meaningful insights."],"metadata":{"id":"m4LPeJla8UXH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"MPscIU0B8U-5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
