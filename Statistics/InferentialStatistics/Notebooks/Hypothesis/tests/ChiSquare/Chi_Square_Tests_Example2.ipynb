If it does not exceed the critical value, you would fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that any observed differences are due to chance.\n","\n","### Key Points:\n","- **Null Hypothesis**: The two variables are independent.\n","- **Alternative Hypothesis**: The two variables are not independent.\n","- The Chi-square test is useful for categorical data, especially when you want to see if there's a relationship between two variables."],"metadata":{"id":"5GtpyjLJDd1J"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"ryDUtm4sDek4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740113898599,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"imybvLTLDj6B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"fsyhra3gDj-L"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\n","\n","# Create the contingency table\n","data = [[40, 20, 10],  # Male\n","        [10, 30, 40]]  # Female\n","\n","# Convert to a DataFrame for better visualization\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Action', 'Drama', 'Comedy'], index=['Male', 'Female'])\n","print(df)\n","\n","\n","#### Step 2: Perform the Chi-square Test\n","\n","# Perform the Chi-square test\n","chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(df)\n","\n","print(f\"Chi2 Statistic: {chi2}\")\n","print(f\"P-value: {p}\")\n","print(f\"Degrees of Freedom: {dof}\")\n","print(\"Expected Frequencies:\")\n","print(expected)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mbG5oB3Iq14B","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740113900437,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1829,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}},"outputId":"57f70ee9-8532-41ab-8f69-7d619caeb918"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["        Action  Drama  Comedy\n","Male        40     20      10\n","Female      10     30      40\n","Chi2 Statistic: 37.5\n","P-value: 7.19413303032538e-09\n","Degrees of Freedom: 2\n","Expected Frequencies:\n","[[23.33333333 23.33333333 23.33333333]\n"," [26.66666667 26.66666667 26.66666667]]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["p<0.05"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_bU0tP1wl_0R","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740113900453,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}},"outputId":"290499a4-8856-45e5-b1eb-3aa7487dd6bf"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"0o-eO99BDk1I","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740113900464,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Mukesh Kumar","userId":"00664345223903384782"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]}]}
