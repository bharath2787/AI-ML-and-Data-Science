Here are the main types of events along with two examples for each:\n","\n","## 1. Independent Events*****\n","Independent events are those whose outcomes do not affect one another.\n","\n","- **Example 1**: Flipping a coin and rolling a die are independent events; the outcome of one does not influence the other.\n","  \n","- **Example 2**: Drawing a card from a deck and then flipping a coin are independent events, as the result of the coin flip does not affect the card drawn.\n","\n","## 2. Dependent Events\n","Dependent events are those where the outcome of one event affects the outcome of another.\n","\n","- **Example 1**: Drawing two cards from a deck without replacement is a dependent event; the probability of the second card drawn depends on the first card drawn.\n","  \n","- **Example 2**: If you have a bag of marbles and you draw one marble, the probability of drawing a specific color on the second draw depends on the color of the first marble drawn.\n","\n","## 3. Mutually Exclusive Events  ****\n","Mutually exclusive events cannot occur at the same time.\n","\n","- **Example 1**: When rolling a die, getting a 3 and getting a 5 are mutually exclusive events because both cannot happen simultaneously.\n","  \n","- **Example 2**: In a single coin toss, getting heads and tails are mutually exclusive events since you can only get one outcome at a time.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Rsow4qVJ78-0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"ZEn7Yre279hk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
